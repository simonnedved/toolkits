one man , who was savagely stomped by a member of the armed forces in Tahrir Square in 2011 , now claims that the Egyptian people should “ stand together ” with the military , and that all Muslim Brotherhood leaders should be arrested . a prominent democracy activist , Esraa Abdel Fattah , has denounced Morsi ’ s party as a gang of foreign-backed terrorists .
the army leadership is saying the same thing : special measures , maximum force , and revived security units are all necessary to “ fight terrorism . ”
a well-known Dutch novelist voiced a rather typical response , saying that he didn ’ t care much what happened to Morsi ’ s supporters , for they were all “ Islamo-fascists ” anyway . and foreign governments , including that of the United States , are averting their eyes .
there is no doubt that Morsi ’ s government was inexperienced , often incompetent , and showed little interest in listening to views other than those of its supporters , which were often far from liberal . but Morsi ’ s people are not foreign-backed terrorists .
many of them had opinions – for example , on the role of women , on sex , and on the place of Islam in public life – that secular liberals find abhorrent . but silencing these people by force , and calling them foreign-backed terrorists , can have only one result : more violence .
if the outcomes of democratic elections are not respected , people will seek other means to make themselves heard . Morsi ’ s autocratic inclinations may have damaged democracy ; taking him out in a coup deals it a mortal blow .
how to bridge the gap in developing countries between secular , more or less Westernized urban elites and the rural poor is an old question . one solution is to enforce secular modernization by oppressing the poor and their religious organizations .
no democracy in the Middle East that fails to take account of Islam will work . but , without the freedom to express other views and beliefs , democracy will remain illiberal .
many Islamists may in fact prefer an illiberal to a liberal democracy . but liberals who truly favor democracy must accept that Islamists are entitled to play a political role , too .
when Marijuana is Legal
Brisbane – What will happen if Californians votes this November to legalize marijuana use by any adult over the age of 21 years ? let ’ s ignore for the moment the vexed constitutional issues that will be raised if a US state enacts legislation that conflicts with federal law .
by contrast , opponents predict that the change will increase rates of marijuana use , and thus magnify the harm arising from that use . the adverse consequences of greatest concern include more marijuana-related road traffic accidents and deaths ; more psychoses and other serious mental health problems among heavy users ; and heavier marijuana use by young people , negatively affecting their life chances .
the Netherlands , which is popularly believed to have legalized cannabis use along these lines , has in fact tolerated only small-scale retail sales of marijuana in a limited number of coffee shops in its larger cities . marijuana cultivation remains illegal and coffee shop sales are regulated – more strictly in recent years in response to complaints from neighboring countries about “ drug tourism . ”
thus , legally available cheaper marijuana will probably mean more use by more young people , and probably more daily use later into adulthood . in general , the more people who use a drug , the larger the number of problem users there will be ( on the reasonable assumption that problem users comprise a fixed proportion of all users ) .
if current estimates are correct , around 10 % of users ( and one in six who start in adolescence ) may become dependent on marijuana – that is , find it difficult to control or discontinue their use . a minority of these problem users will seek professional help to quit .
dependent marijuana users are more likely to experience road and workplace accidents ( if they drive or work while intoxicated ) ; increased respiratory disease ( if they smoke marijuana ) ; exacerbations of some serious mental disorders ; and impaired school and work performance .
it is uncertain how far these adverse effects can be mitigated by preventive measures such as implementing roadside drug-testing programs , persuading users to use vaporizers rather than smoke joints , discouraging young people from using marijuana , and encouraging early treatment for problem users . experience with alcohol suggests that these approaches may modestly reduce , but not eliminate , the harms associated with use , especially if sellers are allowed to promote their wares .
if marijuana were allowed to be marketed much like alcohol is now , we could expect more problem users than if it were regulated more like pharmaceutical drugs ( say , by requiring users to be licensed ; restricting the number of sales locations , hours of sale , and licensed growers ; and imposing high rates of taxation on higher-THC marijuana ) .
it will be a major policy challenge to get this balance right . greater restrictions would provide incentives for illegal operators to remain , while less restrictive regulation would discourage black marketeers , but at the price of increasing the number of users and problem users . &amp; # 160 ;
marijuana policy involves a choice between the evils of current repressive policies and the evils of increased use under a legal market . Californians will have to decide how much weight to give to respect for adult liberty , protection of minors , avoidance of a large-scale black market , fiscal considerations , and protection of marijuana users ’ health .
when Prevention is Better than Relief
just to its northwest , in Banda Aceh , 160,000 lives were lost in the 2004 tsunami . now , geologists say , the fault that triggered that tsunami is most likely to rupture farther south , putting low-lying coastal towns like Padang , with a population of 900,000 , at high risk of a major earthquake and tsunami within the next 30 years .
in Banda Aceh , the tsunami killed more than half the city ’ s population . in Padang , according to an estimate by the director of the city ’ s disaster management office , a similar tsunami could kill more than 400,000 people .
true , those walls did not work as well as had been hoped , but Japan was nonetheless much better prepared for a tsunami than Padang is . in Padang , even with advance warning of a tsunami , higher ground is too far away , and the narrow streets too choked with traffic , for many people to get to safety in time .
the idea is to build small hills in low-lying parts of the city , with level tops that could be used as parks or sports fields . with the few minutes ’ warning that an earthquake ’ s strong shaking would automatically provide , people could walk to a TEREP and be safe above the highest level a tsunami could reach .
such raised earth parks are a low-cost solution to the tsunami danger in low-lying coastal areas . they use only local materials , provide a valuable community resource in normal times , and have the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives when a tsunami strikes .
after 20 years of operation , the organization remains tiny , especially when compared to organizations like the Red Cross , which primarily do disaster relief work . people are willing to donate hundreds of millions of dollars to help people after a disaster – even after a disaster in a wealthy country like Japan – but are unwilling to invest anything like the same amount to save lives before a predictable disaster strikes .
if we build raised earth parks , we will never see the people who , but for our aid , would have died ; no orphans in desperate need will appear on the nightly news . but isn ’ t it much better to keep parents safe than to help orphans after their parents have been killed ?
this is a situation in which we must stretch our imagination , to understand and be motivated by the good that we are doing . unfortunately , not everyone can do that .
another reason why we do not give to prevent disasters should be familiar to anyone who has ever delayed going to the dentist because the prospect of serious pain in the coming weeks or months just wasn ’ t as motivating as the reluctance to face some more immediate slight discomfort . we tell ourselves that maybe we won ’ t get a toothache after all , even though we know that the odds are that we will .
most of us are not very good at giving proper weight to future events , especially if they are uncertain . so we may tell ourselves that the geologists could be wrong , and perhaps no tsunami will hit Padang in the next 30 years , and by then perhaps we will have new and better technologies for predicting them , giving people more time to get to higher ground .
instead , we should be guided by the best estimates of the chances that an intervention will save lives , as well as by the number of lives that would be saved , and the cost of saving those lives . the evidence suggests that building raised earth parks in places like Padang is very good value indeed .
when Technophobia Becomes Toxic
Stanford – During the late 1990 ’ s , a singular phenomenon appeared in countries around the world . one after another , food and beverage companies capitulated to activists opposed to a promising new technology : the genetic engineering of plants to produce ingredients .
the Japanese brewer Kirin and the Danish brewer Carlsberg eliminated genetically engineered ingredients from their beers . in the United States , the fast-food giant McDonald &apos;s banned them from its menu ; food manufacturers Heinz and Gerber ( then a division of Switzerland-based Novartis ) dropped them from their baby-food lines ; and Frito-Lay demanded that its growers stop planting corn engineered to contain a bacterial protein that confers resistance to insect predation .
these measures were rationalized in various ways , but the reality is that by yielding to the demands of a minuscule number of disingenuous activists , the companies opted to offer less safe products to consumers , thereby exposing themselves to legal jeopardy .
because farming takes place outdoors and in dirt , such contamination is a fact of life . over the centuries , the main culprit in mass food poisoning often has been contamination of unprocessed crops by fungal toxins – a risk that is exacerbated when insects attack food crops , opening wounds that allow fungi ( molds ) to get a foothold .
many regulatory agencies have therefore established recommended maximum fumonisin levels permitted in food and feed products made from corn . the conventional way to meet those standards and prevent the consumption of fungal toxins is simply to test unprocessed and processed grains and discard those found to be contaminated – an approach that is both wasteful and failure-prone .
the bacterial genes express proteins that are toxic to corn-boring insects , but that are harmless to birds , fish , and mammals , including humans . as the modified corn fends off insect pests , it also reduces the levels of the mold Fusarium , thereby reducing the levels of fumonisin .
indeed , researchers at Iowa State University and the US Department of Agriculture have found that the level of fumonisin in the modified corn is reduced by as much as 80 % compared to conventional corn . similarly , an Italian study of weaned piglets that were fed either conventional corn or the same variety modified to synthesize a bacterial protein that confers resistance to insect predation found that the modified variety contained lower levels of fumonisin .
given the health benefits – to say nothing of the often higher and more reliable yields – governments should introduce incentives aimed at increasing use of such genetically engineered grains and other crops . in addition , one would expect public-health advocates to demand that such improved varieties be cultivated and used for food , not unlike requirements that drinking water be chlorinated and fluoridated .
alas , none of this has come to pass . activists continue to mount vocal and tenacious opposition to genetically engineered foods , despite almost 20 years of demonstrated , significant benefits , including reduced use of chemical pesticides ( and thus less chemical runoff into waterways ) , greater use of farming practices that prevent soil erosion , higher profits for farmers , and less fungal contamination .
a groundbreaking study of the political economy of agricultural biotechnology concluded that over-regulation causes “ delays in the global diffusion of proven technologies , resulting in a lower rate of growth in the global food supply and higher food prices . ” Current policies also create “ disincentives for investing in further research and development , resulting in a slowdown in innovation of second-generation technologies anticipated to introduce broad consumer and environmental benefits . ”
everyone involved in food production and consumption has suffered : consumers ( especially in developing countries ) have been subjected to avoidable health risks , and food producers have placed themselves in legal jeopardy for selling products known to have “ design defects . ”
public policy that discriminates against and discourages vital innovations in food production is not policy that has the public ’ s interest at heart .
ready for a US Rate Hike ?
though the Fed has now decided to keep its policy rate ‎ unchanged , it also stated that a rate hike is still on the table for 2015 . the concern is that countries that are dependent on foreign financing could be hit by sudden outflows of international capital , or that currency depreciation following the Fed hike could raise debt-servicing costs for countries and businesses .
governments in the developing world would be wise to worry less about interest-rate changes in the United States – which , in any case , they cannot control – and think more about policy changes they can make at home to strengthen their economies ’ resilience .
an increase in US interest rates is not necessarily bad news for emerging countries . many developing countries – especially in Asia – are in much better macroeconomic shape than they were just before the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s or at the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis .
and the Fed is likely to raise rates only if it judges US economic growth to be strong and sustainable , which would be a positive sign for the global economy in general . furthermore , a delay in raising rates carries its own dangers , encouraging yield-hungry investors to take larger risks – possibly necessitating a sharper or more abrupt change in interest rates in the future .
emerging countries can enhance their resilience to fluctuations in global interest rates by pursuing sound fiscal and monetary policies , continuing necessary structural reforms , and strengthening their financial systems . in particular , recent research suggests four key policy areas in which governments should consider intervening .
for starters , countries should embrace policies that favor foreign direct investment ( FDI ) over inflows that can be withdrawn more quickly , such as foreign bank loans , debt , or equity investments . my research with Hui Tong of the International Monetary Fund shows that countries whose capital inflows that are mainly in the form of FDI tend to be more resilient to foreign financial shocks .
second , exchange rates need to reflect economic fundamentals . but while theory suggests that flexible exchange rates should blunt foreign monetary or financial shocks , in practice , such a currency regime rarely works on its own .
indeed , my research with the Asian Development Bank ’ s Xuehui Han has shown that when the US raises or lowers interest rates , most developing countries tend to follow suit , even when they have a flexible exchange rate . the key reason is that they want to avoid large swings in the value of their currency .
the notable exceptions to this trend are countries that manage cross-border capital flows , especially the corporate sector ’ s exposure to foreign-currency debt . indeed , certain types of capital-flow management – including limiting domestic debt denominated in foreign currency for both firms and households – have been shown to increase resilience .
third , domestic macroprudential and microprudential policies increase resilience . these policies should aim at reducing or eliminating the wedge between activities that are good for individuals , banks , and firms , and those that benefit society as a whole .
thus , during periods of expansion , when banks are eager to fund ever more risky borrowers , the reserve ratio rises , curbing potentially disruptive asset bubbles or overinvestment . for those countries capable of designing and implementing prudential regulations , management of cross-border capital flows becomes less useful and less desirable .
finally , it is no longer appropriate to judge whether a country ’ s foreign-currency reserves are adequate based on how many months of imports they can cover . instead , the question to ask is whether the reserves can comfortably service the public and private sectors ’ debt denominated in foreign currencies .
the US will normalize its interest rate policy sooner or later according to its need . for other countries , it is important to focus on policies that can strengthen resilience to foreign financial or monetary shocks .
when the Yankees Go Home
Islamabad – Relations between the United States and Pakistan have continued to fray since a US Special Forces team killed Osama bin Laden in a comfortable villa near a major Pakistani military academy . but the tit-for-tat retaliation that has followed the raid reflects deeper sources of mistrust and mutual suspicion .
indeed , this is not the first time that Pakistan ’ s relations with the US have been on a slippery slope . in 1965 , after helping the country to build up its economy and its military strength , the US walked out over the war with India that Pakistan had provoked by sending “ freedom fighters ” into Kashmir .
in 1989 , following the Soviet Union ’ s exit from Afghanistan , the US lost interest in what it now calls AfPak – Afghanistan-Pakistan . the Americans began returning to Pakistan until , in 1998 , the Pakistani government decided to follow India in testing an atomic bomb .
after receiving a “ you are either with us or against us ” warning from President George W. Bush ’ s administration , General Pervez Musharraf ’ s Pakistan decided to side with the US . it severed relations with Afghanistan ’ s Taliban regime , which it had helped to install five years earlier , and allowed America to use its air space to launch strikes on Afghanistan .
for more than a decade , Pakistan and the US were close allies . Pakistan let the US use its air bases to launch drone attacks on Taliban fighters in Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan ; allowed its territory to be used as a supply route for NATO forces in landlocked Afghanistan ; and , less enthusiastically than the US wished , launched military operations against Taliban sanctuaries on the Pakistani side of the porous border with Afghanistan .
in addition , Congress passed the Kerry-Lugar bill , which promised $ 7.5 billion in economic aid from 2009-2014 . the US also encouraged the International Monetary Fund to give Pakistan emergency financial assistance equivalent to $ 11 billion , to be disbursed starting in late 2008 .
this alerted Pakistan to the fact that , with the imminent departure of US troops , it would be left alone to fight the insurgency on both sides of its border with Afghanistan . to do that , Pakistan would need help from some of the Afghan Pashtun tribes with which it had developed strong relations during the war against the Soviet Union .
the Jalaluddin Haqqani group , which was allowed to base itself in a sanctuary in Pakistan ’ s North Waziristan tribal agency , was one such ally that Pakistan ’ s government thought could be used to further its interests in Afghanistan . but the Haqqanis were also the group that threatened the Americans the most .
Pakistan ’ s embarrassed military pressed the government to begin distancing itself from the US . after the identity of the CIA ’ s station chief in Pakistan was exposed ( probably by Pakistani military officials ) , America made it known that it had good evidence that a prominent Pakistani journalist was ordered murdered by ISI .
on one hand , Pakistan is seeking large investments from China to improve its physical infrastructure and exploit its considerable mineral wealth . on the other hand , the Chinese have been invited to develop Gwadar port on the Balochistan coast , and to use it as a base for their fast-expanding navy .
while China has not responded to these overtures with the degree of enthusiasm that accompanied them , the Chinese would be happy to fill the strategic vacuum likely to be created by America ’ s accelerated departure from AfPak . a major realignment of forces in the region is looming , and , with it , a new round of Asia ’ s old Great Game .
when Women Lead
Munich – Would the world be more peaceful if women were in charge ? a challenging new book by the Harvard University psychologist Steven Pinker says that the answer is “ yes . ”
traditional war is a man ’ s game : tribal women never band together to raid neighboring villages . ” As mothers , women have evolutionary incentives to maintain peaceful conditions in which to nurture their offspring and ensure that their genes survive into the next generation .
if they were empowered as leaders , the conditions of an anarchic world would force them to make the same bellicose decisions that men do . Margaret Thatcher , Golda Meir , and Indira Gandhi were powerful women ; all of them led their countries to war .
it was their success in conforming to male values that enabled their rise to leadership in the first place . in a world in which women held a proportionate share ( one-half ) of leadership positions , they might behave differently in power .
in terms of stereotypes , various psychological studies show that men gravitate to the hard power of command , while women are collaborative and intuitively understand the soft power of attraction and persuasion . Americans tend to describe leadership with tough male stereotypes , but recent leadership studies show increased success for what was once considered a “ feminine style . ”
in information-based societies , networks are replacing hierarchies , and knowledge workers are less deferential . management in a wide range of organizations is changing in the direction of “ shared leadership , ” and “ distributed leadership , ” with leaders in the center of a circle rather than atop a pyramid .
in the United States , the Pentagon says that Army drillmasters do “ less shouting at everyone , ” because today ’ s generation responds better to instructors who play “ a more counseling-type role . ” Military success against terrorists and counterinsurgents requires soldiers to win hearts and minds , not just break buildings and bodies .
modern leaders must be able to use networks , to collaborate , and to encourage participation . women ’ s non-hierarchical style and relational skills fit a leadership need in the new world of knowledge-based organizations and groups that men , on average , are less well prepared to meet .
in the past , when women fought their way to the top of organizations , they often had to adopt a “ masculine style , ” violating the broader social norm of female “ niceness . ” Now , however , with the information revolution and democratization demanding more participatory leadership , the “ feminine style ” is becoming a path to more effective leadership .
women still lag in leadership positions , holding only 5 % of top corporate positions and a minority of positions in elected legislatures ( just 16 % in the US , for example , compared to 45 % in Sweden ) . one study of the 1,941 rulers of independent countries during the twentieth century found only 27 women , roughly half of whom came to power as widows or daughters of a male ruler .
so , given the new conventional wisdom in leadership studies that entering the information age means entering a woman ’ s world , why are women not doing better ?
lack of experience , primary caregiver responsibilities , bargaining style , and plain old discrimination all help to explain the gender gap . traditional career paths , and the cultural norms that constructed and reinforced them , simply have not enabled women to gain the skills required for top leadership positions in many organizational contexts .
research shows that even in democratic societies , women face a higher social risk than men when attempting to negotiate for career-related resources such as compensation . women are generally not well integrated into male networks that dominate organizations , and gender stereotypes still hamper women who try to overcome such barriers .
this bias is beginning to break down in information-based societies , but it is a mistake to identify the new type of leadership we need in an information age simply as “ a woman ’ s world . ” Even positive stereotypes are bad for women , men , and effective leadership .
leaders should be viewed less in terms of heroic command than as encouraging participation throughout an organization , group , country , or network . questions of appropriate style – when to use hard and soft skills – are equally relevant for men and women , and should not be clouded by traditional gender stereotypes .
both men and women will make those decisions . but Pinker is probably correct when he notes that the parts of the world that lag in the decline of violence are also the parts that lag in the empowerment of women .
when Yes Means No
most commentators routinely assume that a Yes vote in the May 29 French referendum on the proposed European Union Constitution would be good for Europe and the EU . but there is reason to doubt the conventional wisdom .
the French referendum will determine the political fate of French President Jacques Chirac – not France ’ s commitment to Europe , which is fixed and immutable . if the French vote No , M. Chirac is finished .
Europe clearly would be better off with Chirac weakened than strengthened , even if it means a temporary slowing of the pace of integration .
according to Chirac , France ’ s exports are lagging not because France is losing its international competitiveness – although it is , especially to Germany – but because of the strong euro . likewise , France ’ s economic growth is waning not because France has failed to undertake necessary structural reforms , but because European interest rates are too high .
who does Chirac think is at fault ? the European Central Bank , of course , for allowing the euro to appreciate too much and for not cutting interest rates enough .
unfortunately , this is typical of Chirac ’ s leadership style : blame others , excuse yourself , and ignore reform . this is hardly the type of leadership Europe needs to survive and prosper in the modern world .
Europe also would continue to be dominated by the interests of the big countries , with the small countries in the back of the bus . the fate of the Franco-German axis , in particular , hinges on the outcome of the referendum .
“ Who would follow Chirac if the French vote No ? ” asked one EU ambassador in a recent interview . “ Even Berlin has options . ”
Eastern Europe also has a big stake in the outcome of the French referendum . Chirac made it perfectly clear how he feels about the new smaller countries when he told them to “ shut up ” when they disagreed with him over Iraq .
more recently , Chirac ’ s foreign minister , Michel Barnier , chastised the Romanian President Traian Barescu for lacking a “ European reflex , ” because Barescu plans to align Romania with Anglo-Saxon liberal economic policies , and wants a special relationship with the US and UK to improve security in the Black Sea region .
rather than buckle to France ’ s will , however , the Romanian president warned France ’ s leaders to stop lecturing his country – a sure sign that French influence is on the wane even in countries with which it has had close historical ties .
a French No would sit well with the Union ’ s newer members from Eastern Europe , who know Chirac is not their friend , and who are more attracted by promises of rapid economic growth than social protection and corporate state mischief .
but why would the EU fall into chaos and the euro wilt if the Treaty of Nice remains in force . in the area of monetary integration , the European Constitution doesn ’ t change anything , other than the voting procedures in the Governing Council if EMU grows beyond 15 member countries .
a Yes vote , on the other hand , would encourage a reassured Chirac to continue his policy of no reform and scapegoating the ECB . external political pressure on the ECB and its president , Jean-Claude Trichet , to lower interest rates and talk the euro down surely would increase .
where are the Global Problem Solvers ?
governments are engaged in a massive negotiation , but they are not engaged in a massive effort at problem-solving . each country asks itself , “ How do I do the least and get the other countries to do the most ? , ” when they should be asking instead , “ How do we cooperate to achieve our shared goals at minimum cost and maximum benefit ? ”
similarly , we will need renewed public confidence in a new generation of nuclear power , with plants that are safe and reliably monitored . we will need new technologies to mobilize large-scale solar power , wind power , and geothermal power .
we will need improved energy efficiency , through “ green buildings ” and more efficient appliances . we will need to switch from cars with internal-combustion engines to hybrids , plug-in hybrids , battery-powered , and fuel-cell-powered vehicles .
achieving a new generation of electric vehicles will require a decade of public and private partnership to achieve basic technological development ( such as improved batteries ) , a more robust electric grid , new infrastructure for re-charging the automobiles , and much more . similarly , it will take a decade of public and private investments to demonstrate the feasibility of coal-fired plants that capture their carbon dioxide .
where the benefits are unlikely to accrue to private investors , who should pay for the early demonstration models , which will require billions of dollars ? how should we preserve private incentives for research and development while committing to transfer successful technologies to developing countries ?
the negotiations are mainly about which groups of countries should cut their emissions , by how much , how fast , and relative to which baseline year . countries are being pressed to cut emissions by 2020 by certain percentage targets , without much serious discussion about how the cuts can be achieved .
the US will also have to decide on the renewal and expansion of its nuclear power plants , and on the use of public lands to build new renewable energy plants , especially using solar power . and the US will need a new power grid to carry renewable energy from low-density population sites – such as the southwestern deserts for solar power and the northern plains for wind power – to the high-density populations of the coasts .
similarly , China , like the US , can reduce CO2 emissions through increased energy efficiency and a new fleet of electric vehicles . but China must consider the question from the vantage point of a coal-dependent economy .
based on these building blocks , the world could agree on allocating the costs for speeding the development and spread of new low-emission technologies . this global framework would underpin national and global targets for emissions control and for monitoring the progress of the technological overhaul .
my plea to discuss plans and strategies alongside specific emissions targets might seem to risk impeding the negotiations . but if we don ’ t have a strategy to accompany our targets , the world ’ s governments might not accept such targets in the first place , or might accept them cynically , without any intention of actually meeting them .
we need to think hard , and collaboratively , about the world ’ s real technological options , and then pursue a common global framework that allows us to move into a new era , one based on feasible and sustainable technologies for energy , transport , industry , and buildings .
where Are the Syrian Peacemakers ?
Denver – Much has been said about the similarities between the chaos in Syria and the Balkan wars of the 1990 ’ s . but , while the prolonged killing may indeed be reminiscent , the political and diplomatic effort that finally ended the war in Bosnia is hardly in evidence today .
no one can watch the ongoing violence in Syria without a sense of horror at the armed attacks on largely unarmed civilians , overwhelmingly by groups that support President Bashar al-Assad ’ s regime . but those who say that Syria is on the brink of civil war miss what has become more obvious with each passing day : Syria alreadyis in a state of civil war , one whose battle lines were drawn months ago .
on one side is Assad ’ s minority Alawite tribe , which over the years has attracted secular Sunnis to share in the spoils of a one-party , authoritarian state . but Assad ’ s coalition is broader than that , which helps to explain how he has been able to hold on to power while other regimes in the region have not .
Iran has sought to maintain its influence in the Levant ( including in Lebanon and among some Palestinian groups ) by providing material support to Assad . by contrast , many Sunni Arab states have provided varying degrees of support to the largely Sunni opposition , a hodgepodge of groups that include the Muslim Brotherhood and other sectarian forces similar to Egypt ’ s ultra-conservative Salafis . &amp; nbsp ;
Russia and China , bruised by their loss of face in the NATO-led intervention in Libya in 2011 , have sought to keep the international community out of Syria . both countries fear that intervention – whether militarily or through economic sanctions – could harm their interests in Syria , where they – especially the Russians – have been the dominant external players .
in the absence of concerted international action , the US and Europe have largely weighed in with vocal condemnation of the party committing the overwhelming number of human-rights violations : Assad and his henchmen . they have also highlighted the loss of life in an effort to shame Russia into adopting a more amenable position .
what is really needed are serious and sustained negotiations among interested international powers ( let ’ s call them a “ contact group ” ) on a viable political outcome . a “ Contact Group Plan ” should be carefully worked out with Annan and his team ( the only entity at this point that seems to have access to all sides ) .
clearly , a new way forward is needed , and a good start would be a political / diplomatic plan that Annan could sell to the parties . in the Balkans , it was a US team that finally sold the Contact Group Plan to the parties directly involved .
where Did Market Volatility Go ?
television and newspapers continue to trumpet every twist and turn of global financial markets . in truth , however , the big story is the uneerie calm that has engulfed virtually every major asset class , from stocks to bonds .
conspiracy theories abound , particularly among the ranks of financial traders , for whom volatility is like wind to a sailor . these traders confidently figure that as long as markets gyrate , no matter what the direction , they can always make money .
the favored bogeymen of the day are giant government investors , particularly Asian central banks , with their trillions of dollars in assets . these superfunds , whose managers do not necessarily share the same passion for profit as private investors , are said to be squeezing the life out of interest rates and exchange rates .
during the 1990 ’ s , private investors looked at big , lumbering central banks as cash cows , long on money and short on financial acumen . George Soros once made a billion dollars off the Bank of England in just an hour .
it was the speculators whose blood flowed in the streets when they attacked Hong Kong ’ s dollar peg in 1998 . but overall , betting against big government financial institutions proved to be a richly rewarding business .
today , many traders see formerly inept state giants as financial geniuses , capable of taming complex financial formulas and exploiting their superior size and trading information to squeeze the life out of currency and interest rate markets . these behemoths ’ innate conservatism , having calmed bond and currency markets , is now having a similar effect on stocks .
as much as we may sympathize with young would-be millionaire traders , does their story of oppression make any sense ? could it be true that huge government investors from Asia ( not to mention Russia , Latin America , and the Middle East ) have quietly taken control of world markets ?
China ’ s central bank alone has around a trillion dollars . this gives them a capital base similar to the combined assets of all the world ’ s major hedge funds .
hedge funds constitute only a small percentage of overall world financial markets , which , according to a recent study by the McKinnsey Global Institute , now exceed $ 120 trillion . and hedge funds , unlike banks , can leverage their bets , borrowing to take on assets many times the size of their capital base .
in fact , the explanation for market calm probably lies elsewhere . so , if a conspiracy of Asian central banks is not to blame for the volatility drought that is parching traders ’ earnings , what is ?
stock market volatility was also very low during the early 1990 ’ s , before reaching new peaks later in the decade . moreover , financial innovation and globalization allow markets to spread risk more effectively than ever before , placing it in the hands of those who can best manage it .
all of these changes have in turn contributed to lower economy-wide output and consumption volatility in both rich and developing countries . they have also contributed mightily to the high general level of asset prices , helping create the vast riches of which today ’ s hungry young traders are so jealous .
unfortunately , no . today ’ s brave new world of financial globalization will almost surely face severe new stress tests , reminding us that recessions still happen .
frankly , although I do not see the five-year-old global expansion coming to an end yet , there is no question that risks are on the rise , with output in the United States having slowed sharply in the third quarter , and central banks ’ hands tied by inflation risks . further ahead , it is not hard to imagine geopolitical instability – possibly emanating from Iran , Iraq , or North Korea – unsettling markets .
whatever the scenario that ends the calm , today ’ s age of low volatility will seem like a distant dream to most of us – and a forgotten nightmare for ambitious financial traders .
which New Middle East ?
Berlin – Regardless of whether democratization in the “ new Middle East ” succeeds or authoritarian forms of government prevail once again , one fundamental change has already become clear : no one will be able to govern without taking into account domestic public opinion .
this change will shift the foreign-policy parameters of the Middle East conflict ( understood as both an Israeli-Palestinian conflict and as a conflict between Israelis and Arabs more generally ) . despite wars in Lebanon and Gaza , and the intifadas in the occupied West Bank , these parameters have proven surprisingly stable for decades , anchored by the peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan and the Oslo accords with the Palestinians .
and , while the tectonic shift in the region was triggered by the “ Arab Awakening , ” its players are not limited to the Arab world or to the confines of the Middle East conflict . the United States , Europe , Turkey , and , in a certain sense , Iran all play a role – some more directly than others .
President Barack Obama ’ s speech in Cairo two years ago created great expectations , but few or none have been fulfilled . instead , the US allowed a political vacuum to form in the absence of any movement on the part of Israel ’ s government .
but , in the last few years , the Europeans , led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy , have de facto slammed the door to European Union accession in Turkey ’ s face . as a result , Turkey has embraced a “ neo-Ottoman ” foreign policy , in which the Arab world – even more than the Caucasus , Central Asia , and the Balkans – plays the central role .
of course , Turkey , in accordance with its political , security , and economic interests , has no choice but to pay close attention to its southern neighborhood , and must try to prevent chaotic developments there . Turkey would be facing the same risks even if it were integrated into a European context , but its priorities would then be completely different .
this bid for regional preeminence will sooner or later bring Turkey into serious conflict with neighboring Iran . if Turkey prevails , Iran and the radicals in the region will be caught on the losing side of history – and they know it .
while Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ’ s government is trying to maintain good relations with Iran , its ambition to become the leading Sunni power means that Turkey must sooner or later contest Iran ’ s influence in Iraq , as well as in Syria and Palestine . and that means conflict .
but , for Turkey as an aspiring regional leader , the interests of the Palestinians are naturally more important than its relations with Israel . this has become all the more true in light of the revolutionary changes in the Arab world , and is at the root of Erdoğan ’ s foreign-policy reorientation .
without a strategic re-orientation of its own – to remain passive is a risky endeavor in a rapidly changing world order – Israel would further delegitimize and isolate itself internationally . a viable Israeli answer to the dramatic changes in the region – and to their already foreseeable consequences – can only take the form of a serious offer of negotiations to Mahmoud Abbas ’ s Palestinian government , with the objective of signing a comprehensive peace treaty .
at the same time , the pressure of the Arab revolutions is transforming the Palestinians into a dynamic political factor . for example , in view of the looming fall of Syria ’ s President Bashar al-Assad , the pressure of the Egyptian revolution , and the new role of Islamism in the region , Hamas ’ s alliance with Iran is becoming increasingly problematic .
in any case , Hamas faces some risky and consequential decisions of its own – all the more so should its main rival , Abbas ’ s Palestinian Authority , succeed in its current diplomatic campaign at the United Nations . Obama had promised a Palestinian state within one year , and Abbas is now building upon that promise .
will Abbas be able to keep the Palestinians on a diplomatic path , or will the situation degenerate again into violence and another disaster ? and what will the Palestinian road towards peace look like after the UN decision to recognize some form of statehood for Palestine ?
given the current pace of change in the Middle East , we might not have to wait long for answers – or for more questions .
which Turkey in What Europe ?
the election in Germany was in part fought on the issue , as Chancellor Angela Merkel ran on a platform of offering Turkey a “ privileged partnership , ” rather than full admission . the Austrian government ’ s posturing – motivated as much by its upcoming elections as genuine foreign policy concerns – seemed to threaten the opening of the accession talks themselves .
but German foreign policy has always been marked by continuity , and the new foreign minister , Frank-Walter Steinmeier , the chief of staff under former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , has repeatedly advocated full membership for Turkey . it is thus unlikely that the Grand Coalition will adopt a different political approach towards Turkey than the previous Red-Green government .
but much of the debate about Turkey ’ s possible accession has been focused on the wrong issues : whether Turkey is culturally “ in line ” with Europe or whether Europe is in some sense “ Christian ” and could assimilate 100 million Muslims . the real issue – not disputed even by most Turks – is that Turkey is neither economically ready nor , above all , a mature enough democracy for full EU membership .
Turkey ’ s pro-Western forces find just as much fault with their country ’ s political system as the European critics , but they expect the prospect of EU membership to accelerate the progress of reforms . nationalist Turks , on the other hand , regard joining the EU mainly as a confirmation of national power and view all criticism of the country as a violation of Turks ’ collective honor .
had the start of accession negotiations been postponed or canceled , Turkey ’ s pro-Europeans would have suffered from a nationalist backlash . even now , Turkey ’ s unrequited love for Europe can still fade into aversion , with Islamic fundamentalism and Greater Turkey nationalism continuing to represent other , eastward-leaning options .
but , more importantly , the lack of clarity on the Turkish accession question reflects Europe ’ s ambivalence regarding its image of itself . to be sure , Turkey shows substantial political and cultural differences , especially when it comes to the importance of civil society , sexual equality , and the role of religion in public life .
many “ old ” Europeans , including Germany after Schröder ’ s resignation and France under a weakened Jacques Chirac , share that stance . Britain , the leading nation of “ new ” Europe , has no desire for an EU constitution , more executive and parliamentary power in Brussels , a stronger European Parliament , or the euro .
like many new members , Britain prefers a loosely connected Europe of different nations – essentially a free-trade zone , but with open borders at its periphery – with sufficient strategic coordination to constitute a quasi-empire in geopolitical terms , on a par with the United States .
paradoxically , then , what the British , with their opposition to “ deepening ” European integration , are really offering the Turks is precisely the sort of “ privileged partnership ” that Austria , together with Angela Merkel , has been backing . both positions reject the idea of making Turkey really “ European . ”
the structure that Britain seems to have in mind is , according to some , reminiscent of the loose alliance binding the British Commonwealth . but “ History ’ s ruse ” could be that even as the British succeed in improving Turkey ’ s prospects for admission , the renegotiation of the Nice treaty , which will become necessary if Croatia is admitted , is likely to lead to stronger European integration .
which Way is West for Turkey ?
when Turkey &apos;s parliament voted in March 2003 against allowing American troops to open a northern front against Iraq , Turkey &apos;s traditional strategic partnership with the United States ended . the two countries still recognize many mutual interests , but now they manage these interests on a far different basis .
Europeans who considered Turkey a potential Trojan horse for America within the European Union were forced to reconsider . for many Arabs , the vote showed that Turkey was not an American lackey and would not cooperate with American imperial designs , despite close Turkish-Israeli relations .
long-simmering disagreements between Turkey and the US came to a boil with the emergence of the Kurds of northern Iraq as the Pentagon &apos;s main allies in the Iraq War . the American administration made it clear that military intervention by Turkey in Northern Iraq would not be tolerated .
that message was confirmed on July 4 , 2003 , when American forces arrested several Turkish Special Forces troops in the town of Sulaimaniya , humiliating them by putting sacks over their head as they took them into custody . only intervention by US Vice President Dick Cheney two and a half days later secured the release of the soldiers , who were alleged to have been planning clandestine operations within the Kurdish zone .
despite ongoing tensions , the Turkish government has been eager to mend relations with America , as it is anxious to have some influence over developments in Iraq . so the authorities responded quickly to the Bush administration &apos;s request for Turkish troops to join the coalition , although the idea was stillborn - rejected by both the Kurds and the American-appointed Governing Council in Iraq .
Turkey &apos;s secular , capitalistic , democratic order has become especially valuable to the Bush administration as it seeks to integrate the wider Middle East into the world system by liberalizing its economy and democratizing its polity . thus , America trumpeted its continuing support for Turkish membership in the EU , notably in President Bush &apos;s speech in June at Istanbul &apos;s Galatasaray University - at a bridge that joins Asia and Europe .
more broadly , the government regards the US as too complacent vis-à-vis Kurdish political developments and unmoved by Turkey &apos;s concerns about Kurdish independence . the US , for its part , is unhappy with the government &apos;s objections to unrestricted American use of the Incirlik airbase in southeastern Turkey , as well as by recent tensions with Israel .
in the meantime , Turkey is moving closer to the EU , with the government overcoming nationalistic objections in the Parliament to push through comprehensive reforms . Turkey also showed its good will over Cyprus , removing a nagging political obstacle to EU membership .
previously , Turkey viewed Iraq solely in the context of its domestic Kurdish problem . but widespread European opposition to the war removed the possibility of Turkish military intervention , forcing the government to develop another vision of Turkey &apos;s interests .
the northern border with Turkey is their lifeline to the outside world . as a result , Turkey no longer considers a federalized Iraq a threat to its security , as long as each federal unit maintains a measure of ethnic diversity .
Turkey has no desire to serve as a strategic counterweight to Iran and believes that only a territorially intact Iraq can continue to play that role . furthermore , Turkey is concerned about the possibility of civil war in Kurdistan between the two largest Kurdish factions .
but , unlike either Iran or Syria , Turkey genuinely wishes to see a strong and representative government in Baghdad . thanks to EU pressures , Turkey &apos;s domestic Kurdish problem is well on the way to being resolved democratically , with most Kurdish leaders in Turkey expressing their commitment to Turkish unity .
for Turkey to consider military intervention in Kurdistan , EU member states would first have to renege on their commitment to negotiate Turkish accession . equally dramatic would be any attempt by the Kurds to forcibly change the demographic balance of the multiethnic city of Kirkuk .
Turkey would prefer that Kirkuk , with its large Turkmen population , be given special status in the forthcoming draft Iraqi constitution . the US also shows signs of understanding the importance of maintaining a multiethnic Kirkuk and is putting pressure on its Kurdish allies .
Turkish diplomacy has thus become a well-calibrated balancing act , moving closer to European positions in the Middle East , but eager to maintain close relations with the US . if this approach succeeds , Europe &apos;s bridge to Asia may also become its bridge to America .
White House Sex Crimes
new YORK – Sex crime has a telltale signature , even when those directing the outrages are some of the most powerful men and women in the United States . how extraordinary , then , to learn that one of the perpetrators of these crimes , Condoleezza Rice , has just led the debate in a special session of the United Nations Security Council on the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war .
I had a sense of déjà vu when I saw the photos that emerged in 2004 from Abu Ghraib prison . even as the Bush administration was spinning the notion that the torture of prisoners was the work of “ a few bad apples ” low in the military hierarchy , I knew that we were seeing evidence of a systemic policy set at the top .
we now know that the torture of prisoners was the result of a policy set in the White House by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , Vice President Dick Cheney , and Rice – who actually chaired the torture meetings . the Pentagon has also acknowledged that it had authorized sexualized abuse of detainees as part of interrogation practices to be performed by female operatives .
the sexualization of torture from the top basically turned Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay into an organized sex-crime ring in which the trafficked sex slaves were US-held prisoners . looking at the classic S and M nature of some of this torture , it is hard not to speculate that someone setting policy was aroused by all of this .
the nonsexual torture that was committed ranged from beatings and suffocation , electrodes attached to genitals , and forced sleep deprivation , to prisoners being hung by the wrists from the ceiling and placed in solitary confinement until psychosis was induced . these abuses violate both US and international law .
though we can now debate what the penalty for water-boarding should be , America as a nation , maintaining an odd silence , still cannot seem to discuss the sexual crimes involved .
indeed , the Military Commissions Act of 2006 was written deliberately with loopholes that gave immunity to perpetrators of many kinds of sexual humiliation and abuse .
all this may sound bizarre if you are a normal person , but it is standard operating procedure for sex offenders . those who work in the field know that once sex abusers control a powerless victim , they will invariably push the boundaries with ever more extreme behavior .
the perpetrator is also likely to engage in ever-escalating rationalizations , often arguing that the offenses serve a greater good . finally , the victim is blamed for the abuse : in the case of the detainees , if they would only “ behave , ” and confess , they wouldn ’ t bring all this on themselves .
silence , and even collusion , is also typical of sex crimes within a family . Americans are behaving like a dysfunctional family by shielding sex criminals in their midst through silence .
throughout the world , this perverse and graphic criminality has added fuel to anxiety about US cultural and military power . these acts need to be called by their true names – war crimes and sex crimes – and people in America need to demand justice for the perpetrators and their victims .
Whither Africa ’ s “ Frontier Markets ” ?
new YORK – Zimbabwe ’ s election appears , once again , to confirm a truism : Africa only seems to make international headlines when disasters strike – a drought , a coup , a war , a genocide , or , as in the case of Robert Mugabe , grossly incompetent government . but , over the past several years , a number of sub-Saharan countries have attracted unprecedented inflows of foreign capital .
first , high commodity prices yield windfall profits for the region ’ s leading producers of raw materials . growing demand for energy , metals , and minerals – particularly in China – has driven unprecedented levels of foreign investment .
these remittances are vitally important for economic stability in several African countries . an economic slowdown in the US and Europe could substantially slow this infusion of cash , because immigrants are often the first to lose their jobs when recession fears take hold .
militants in the oil-rich Niger Delta region have at times shut down as much as 30 % of the country ’ s oil exports , a vital source of state revenue . President Umaru Yar ’ Adua has taken concrete steps to tackle elite-level corruption in Nigeria , and appears to have made progress toward a comprehensive peace agreement with the Delta rebels .
but Yar ’ Adua might soon confront a big short-term problem . the country ’ s National Election Tribunal , having overturned the outcomes of several provincial elections , may well annul the results of last year ’ s presidential race , forcing him to run for president all over again .
solid economic expansion and one of the world ’ s fastest-growing stock markets have not helped the country avert a deepening political crisis and mounting ethnic violence since disputed presidential election results in December . President Mwai Kibaki , whom international observers accuse of rigging the vote , has hinted at a plan to share power in a unity government , but opposition leader Raila Odinga has heard these promises before .
despite the alarming escalation in violence , fears of civil war in Kenya are probably exaggerated . the country ’ s Orange opposition movement has recently won key posts in parliament and , for the moment , is heeding calls for calm from former United nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and representatives of the African Union .
the continent ’ s third pillar , South Africa , will spend 2008 mired in an escalating political feud between Thabo Mbeki , the lame-duck president , and Jacob Zuma , a former deputy who is the newly elected leader of the ruling African National Congress and the leading candidate to succeed Mbeki , his bitter rival , next year .
South Africa ’ s courts have become a political battleground , as Mbeki and his allies use corruption charges to try to cripple Zuma ’ s candidacy . the resulting political firestorm may well force Zuma to rely on core support from key allies within the country ’ s trade union movement and Communist Party , challenging the political elite ’ s pro-market consensus and provoking debate over the future of South Africa ’ s economic policy .
no countries in sub-Saharan Africa will have the economic heft and political self-confidence to replace Nigeria , Kenya , and South Africa as pillars of stability anytime soon . regional blocs like the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , the Southern African Customs Union ( SACU ) , and the East African Community ( EAC ) will eventually assume larger roles in helping resolve the continent ’ s most intractable diplomatic and economic problems .
there remain many good reasons for investors to take a chance on Africa ’ s frontier markets . but it will not necessarily take a drought , a coup , a war , or a genocide to make them think twice .
Whither Europe ?
where do the European Union , the eurozone , and the EU ’ s highly indebted countries go from here ? will Europe be able to roll back its welfare states ’ biggest excesses without economic distress and social unrest toppling governments and , in the peripheral countries , undermining already-tenuous agreements with creditors ?
the United States ’ economy is gradually reviving , albeit slowly by the standards of recovery from a deep recession . China , Brazil , and India have not decoupled from their customers in Europe and North America , and so are slowing , though a relatively soft landing is likely if Europe ’ s recession is as short and mild as predicted .
the EU ’ s economic output and population are larger than that of the US , so the fate of the 27 EU countries is everyone ’ s business , from New York to New Delhi , São Paulo to Shanghai . formed originally as a free-trade area , the eurozone comprises 17 of the countries .
with some members inside of the eurozone , and others remaining outside of it , and with disparate economic interests and monetary and fiscal traditions even within the eurozone , agreement is difficult . that sets the stage for three broad scenarios , each with implications for the European and global economy , the financial and banking system , and relations between the member states and EU institutions .
in the first scenario , a more united and homogeneous Europe emerges from the crisis , enforcing greater restrictions on member states ’ budgets to reduce apparent risk . accompanied by a strong , broad eurozone , risk of a future currency crisis remains .
in the second scenario , a two- or three-tiered Europe includes a two-tiered euro , with the weaker countries using a separate “ euro-B ” currency that can float against the stronger economies ’ “ euro-A . ” This arrangement would hold out the promise to fiscally stressed economies that , if they get their act together , they could rejoin euro-A – and do so more readily than they could from their own currency .
in the final scenario , what emerges is a more decentralized Europe , with less top-down agreement in areas beyond trade and a smaller , more homogeneous eurozone composed of the EU ’ s core economies . such a construct would be far more popular with citizens who are unhappy with the accretion of EU power in Brussels and the loss of traditional sovereignty .
none of these options is easy ; each entails serious difficulties and great risks . episodic muddling through may be the best that can be hoped for .
for example , how would Greece ( or any country ) exit the euro in order to cushion the extreme downward wage adjustment required to regain competitiveness , and to avoid the severe social unrest that could result from reining in debt too rapidly ? as soon as word got out that Greece was seriously considering such a move – well before it could even generate a new drachma currency – euro bank deposits would flee Greece .
as a result , Greece would be forced to impose capital controls . some contracts denominated in euros would be subject to Greek law , some to European law , and others – for example , derivatives contracts – to British or US law .
in the US , the 1980 ’ s deficit limits set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law were not met , and , like the SGP , were revised and extended . agreements with , and access to , the International Monetary Fund and Europe ’ s new bailout fund provide ( soft ) constraints .
but , while doing so , they are not likely to be expanding private-sector lending to support economic growth . European banks are far more thinly capitalized , and account for a much larger share of credit extended , than banks in the US , where much more lending originates in capital markets .
most large US banks – Citi is an exception – passed US Federal Reserve stress tests recently , with enough capital to withstand a hypothetical deep recession ( 13 % unemployment , a 21 % further fall in home prices , and a 50 % stock-market decline ) . Europe ’ s stress tests have been much weaker .
we can expect further European turmoil – from banks , sovereign debt , and social unrest in response to even modest welfare-state rollbacks – and clashing visions , within and among countries , concerning the desirability of deeper European integration . Europe has come a long way from the days when its leaders prophesied that the euro would quickly rival the dollar as a global reserve currency .
it still has great strengths , and , with sensible reforms , the EU can survive and eventually return to greater prosperity and stability . but Europe remains closer to the beginning of that process of renewal than to the end .
Whither North Korea ?
Seoul – According to North Korean state television , the heart attack that killed Kim Jong-il on December 17 was “ due to severe mental and physical stress from overwork . ” That report instantly raised a question in my mind : if we accept the regime ’ s diagnosis , why did Kim need to work so hard , despite his frail health ?
seen in this light , the more important question is whether or not Kim ’ s inexperienced son , the twenty-something “ Great Successor ” Kim Jong-un , will be able to consolidate power and somehow steer the country out of its deep malaise . so far , the succession in Pyongyang seems to be proceeding in an orderly fashion .
the “ Great Successor ” has had barely two years of on-the-job training , compared to the 14 years his father spent studying directly under Kim Il-sung . of course , Kim Jong-il ’ s sister , Kim Kyung-hee , and his sister-in-law , Jang Seong-taek , will assume something of a regency role , acting both as patron to the Great Successor and as a force to mobilize the military to close ranks behind the Kim dynasty .
but it is not clear how faithfully , and for how long , Kim Kyung-hee and Jang will remain supportive of Kim Jong-un . they might even try to supplant Kim by claiming power for themselves .
another challenge may come from the country ’ s senior leaders , especially among the military . &amp; # 160 ; Will they remain faithful to Kim , who is 40-50 years their junior ?
it is known that some senior military officers were quietly critical of Kim Jong-il ’ s failure in managing the country ’ s relationship with the United States and Japan . their expectation might have been that North Korea could improve relations with the US while retaining its nuclear weapons , in exchange for not developing long-range missiles .
had that happened , economic assistance from the US and Japan would have flowed into North Korea , enabling the regime to manage the country ’ s moribund economy much better without initiating reforms , which the military appears to regard as dangerous . instead , with the economy , particularly food production , continuing to falter , perhaps one-third of the country is living at or below starvation levels .
in the early stages of this precarious succession , China has behaved as expected , trying to prop up the regime in order to ensure stability in its nuclear-armed neighbor . China ’ s foreign ministry sent a strong message of support for Kim Jong-un , and encouraged North Koreans to unite under the new leader .
but the key external factor in ensuring a peaceful succession will be the policies of South Korea and the US , which must decide whether they can work with the North in the post-Kim Jong-il era . will they wait to see what happens to the new leader , and thus continue their policy of “ strategic patience , ” which focuses mainly on denuclearization , and not move on to other areas until the North moves first ?
or will South Korea and the US try to take advantage of Kim Jong-il ’ s passing with new policy initiatives ? if they can develop a two-track policy framework aimed at facilitating economic reform inside North Korea while continuing international pressure for denuclearization , constructive engagement may be possible .
in the feverish atmosphere of political high season , it will not be easy for incumbent administrations to pursue bold but risky policies . this is the agony of democracy , and it is why the next year may prove to be the most unstable , and even dangerous , period in decades for the Korean peninsula and the region .
what if , for example , Kim Jong-un fails to consolidate power , perceives the domestic political situation as worsening , owing to elite power struggles or popular discontent , and deems the external environment , especially South Korea and the US ever more hostile ? in that case , Kim III may grasp at provocation in one form or another , as his father did with intermittent attacks on South Korea in recent years .
Whither Pakistan ?
as 2010 concludes , several outstanding issues continue to bedevil the country . how they are managed in the year ahead will determine not only Pakistan ’ s immediate future and long-term prospects , but also the security of its region and , indeed , much of the world .
it remains uncommitted to the idea of denying sanctuaries on its territory to Taliban fighters battling American and NATO troops in Afghanistan . relations with India have soured in recent months , because Pakistan ’ s government is once again lending diplomatic support to the insurgency in Indian-controlled Kashmir .
Sunni Islamic extremists now target minority groups as well as other Muslim sects . some 800 liberal and Sufi Islamic scholars have died in targeted killings by extremist groups who receive financial assistance from like-minded people in the Middle East , and some well-known and much-visited Sufi shrines have been bombed .
indeed , a senior cabinet minister suggested recently that the international community should write off Pakistan ’ s debts – an amount estimated at $ 40 billion . the minister of finance forcefully repudiated the suggestion the following day , indicating that the government has not developed a consistent approach towards the faltering economy .
this damage could lower annual GDP growth by 1-1.5 % for several years to come . in the 2010-2011 fiscal year , the IMF estimates that economic output will increase by less than 3 % – one-third the rate expected in neighboring India and less than half that of Bangladesh .
slower economic growth will cause a shortfall of jobs for new entrants to the workforce , thereby increasing the incidence of poverty . indeed , the number of people living in absolute poverty is likely to increase by 10 million , bringing the total to more than 70 million , or 40 % of the population .
despite passage in July of the 18th amendment to the Pakistani constitution , which restored it to the form in which it was promulgated in 1973 , political and executive authority remains in the hands of President Asif Ali Zardari . the changes are supposed to make the executive branch accountable to the elected parliament , expand the prime minister ’ s authority , devolve more power to the provinces , and ensure independence to the judiciary .
general Ashfaq Pervez Kayani ’ s term in office , which was set to expire in November , was extended by three years . thus empowered , the general has been able to exert his influence over foreign policy , in particular in defining the country ’ s relations with the US , India , and Afghanistan .
will the US increase its pressure by intervening militarily if Pakistan continues to harbor Taliban fighters operating from the tribal areas ? will the military subvert the constitutional changes aimed at reforming the political system ?
despite all the grim news and auguries , there is some hope , owing to the increased political mobilization of Pakistan ’ s middle classes , whose members have finally begun to question those espousing extremism . the judiciary is also more active , and is attempting to force the executive to remain within the bounds of the constitution .
moreover , a trade agreement with Afghanistan that allows Afghan goods to cross Pakistan en route to India may be one step towards an improvement of economic relations with that large and rapidly growing neighbor .
indeed , an able economic team that has been installed in the government seems – at long last – to be addressing some of the economy ’ s deep structural flaws . as India in the 1990 ’ s and Brazil in the early 2000 ’ s showed , economies in deep distress can recover quickly once the right policies are implemented .
so all hope is not lost in Pakistan . on the contrary , 2011 may well prove to be a better year for a battered economy and a political system under stress .
Whither the Egyptian Revolution ?
the West is , of course , limited in its ability to shape the transition process . nonetheless , the potential for constructive influence remains considerable , and it should be responsive to those in Egypt who favor liberal ideas , democratic institutions , and broad distribution of the benefits of economic development .
will Egypt gravitate toward Islamic theocracy or adopt a secular government that respects minority rights ? which economic policies – statist , liberal , or some combination of the two – will best ensure social justice and broad distribution of prosperity ?
the November elections will not resolve these fundamental questions , and whether a workable constitutional framework will develop is uncertain . a parliamentary system of government will likely emerge , including a prime minister and a cabinet , with the strong possibility that the presidency will be politically overshadowed , particularly if the presidential election is delayed .
so a coalition government will be necessary . the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood ( the Freedom and Justice Party ) currently is the best-organized party , and may be in the strongest position to form a majority coalition , including Salafist elements .
although sentiment favoring a secular state is considerable , a coalition that can serve as an alternative or counterweight to the Muslim Brotherhood will be difficult to assemble . in the near term , the most likely counterweight could be a liberal coalition with a heavy component of former members of deposed President Hosni Mubarak ’ s National Democratic Party ( NDP ) – that is , those who have not been discredited by their association with Mubarak .
approximately one-third of the new parliament will comprise “ non-party list ” candidates . established networks based on family , local loyalties , and tribal affiliations will be key determinants in voting . &amp; # 160 ; These circumstances may favor “ non-party list ” candidates associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and the former NDP , particularly in rural Egypt .
post-election shifts in the composition of coalitions could complicate the situation , making governance even more difficult . power-sharing among coalition partners will be an intricate affair , including behind-the-scenes deals with the military , which will insist on measures to safeguard its interests .
expectations of economic improvement are extremely high . the initial elected government may pay an early political price for failure .
the starting point for the West in trying to assist Egypt ’ s transition must be recognition that patient , long-term engagement will be required . the effectiveness of this engagement will depend primarily on the persuasiveness of the West ’ s policy prescriptions , rather than on the volume of financial assistance .
G-8 countries have already pledged support to post-Mubarak Egypt , including economic aid , debt relief , and loan guarantees . these steps are important , though delivery will be prolonged and the likely impact modest , at least in the near-term .
but , apart from an IMF-backed reform program , if the Egyptian government ’ s policy framework is right , resources will flow from the private sector , including foreign investment supportive of job creation and economic development . this is the message that Egypt needs to grasp and embrace .
it is far too early to judge the strength of internal forces promoting liberal economic policies . the need for economic growth could intrinsically push policymakers toward market-oriented economic policies ( sensitive to considerations of “ social justice ” ) and an open investment environment .
powerful forces within the Egyptian business community are silent at the moment , but in time will reassert themselves . many business interests with job-creating capacity want the continuation of market-oriented reforms begun a decade ago ( which produced impressive growth rates ) , but support broadening prosperity and rooting out corruption .
indeed , Western governments should continue to use their channels to the Egyptian military and future civil leadership to encourage them to uphold the rule of law , to act with restraint , and to respect free expression . regional security arrangements will also require careful maintenance .
finally , countries supportive of a democratic Egypt should focus on encouraging the institutional and social underpinnings of democratic process and market reform . this depends on the development of a robust civil society , tolerant of open debate , and healthy liberal political parties , as well as active participation by women and an independent media .
private non-profit organizations and private enterprise , rather than governments directly , are best equipped to provide this type of training and expertise for leadership development and capacity building . the job of democratic governments is to provide the resources that can make delivery of this aid possible .
who Are Tomorrow ’ s Consumers ?
Singapore – Luxury-brand companies ’ stock prices plunged in July , after their financial results disappointed investors , owing largely to slower sales in emerging markets , especially in China . meanwhile , news reports indicate that high-end shopping malls in India and China are increasingly empty .
many analysts had expected emerging markets to generate exponential growth over the next decade . but now there is talk of how the global crisis is slowing down these economies and killing off discretionary spending .
but a slowdown in China ’ s economic growth cannot really be blamed for slower sales of luxury goods or empty malls . the annual growth rate of China ’ s $ 7.5 trillion economy decelerated to 7.6 % in the second quarter , from 8.1 % in January-March – hardly a cause for panic .
China is by far the largest emerging-market economy , with 1.6 million households that can be called “ rich ” ( defined as having annual disposable income of more than $ 150,000 ) . but this is still smaller than Japan ’ s 4.6 million and a fraction of the 19.2 million rich households in the United States .
the explosive growth recorded by this segment in emerging markets in recent years reflected entry into previously untapped markets , with the subsequent slowdown resulting from saturation . the number of high-income households is still growing , but not enough to justify the 30-40 % compounded growth rates expected by some .
this does not mean that growth opportunities in emerging markets have disappeared , but expectations do need to be recalibrated . despite the economic boom of the last decade , China still has 164 million households that can be called “ poor ” ( with annual disposable income of less than $ 5,000 ) and another 172 million that are “ aspirant ” ( between $ 5,000- $ 15,000 ) .
the real story for the next two decades will be these countries ’ shift to middle-class status . although other emerging regions will undergo a similar shift , Asia will dominate this transformation .
a study by the economist Homi Kharas of the Brookings Institution gives us a sense of the scale of this change . he estimates that 18 % of the world ’ s middle class lived in North America in 2009 , while another 36 % lived in Europe .
but Kharas ’ s projections suggest that Asia will account for two-thirds of the world ’ s middle class by 2030 . in other words , Asia will displace not just the West , but even other emerging regions .
we are in the middle of a social and demographic shift that will both destroy and create consumer markets . the aging of developed markets is well known , but the latest data show that emerging markets are aging at an even faster pace .
China ’ s median age is today 34.5 years , compared to 36.9 years for the US . however , the average Chinese will be 42.5 years old by 2030 , compared to 39.1 for the average American .
the number of students enrolled in primary schools in China has fallen by 18 % since 1990 , and by an astonishing 33 % in South Korea . at the other end of the demographic scale , the share of the aged is growing explosively .
meanwhile , the nature of the basic consuming unit – the household – is also changing rapidly . in most developed countries , the traditional nuclear family is in severe decline and is being replaced by single-individual households .
we are simultaneously witnessing the re-emergence of the multigenerational extended family , with as many as 22 % of American adults in the 25-35 age group living with parents or relatives . by contrast , the extended family is giving way in India to nuclear families , which now account for 64 % of households .
for example , we need to revise our mental image of the nuclear family from American suburbia to fit the rapidly expanding cities of India . by the same token , our mental image of the multigenerational extended family needs to include those in the West .
who Beats Corruption ?
even America ’ s Federal Emergency Management Agency , responsible for providing relief after natural disasters and man-made catastrophes , was in the hands of inept political cronies rather than professionals . when hurricane Katrina struck America ’ s Gulf Coast , that incompetence proved fatal .
all societies require an effective government that can provide vital and irreplaceable public services and infrastructure . thus , governments are invested with unique powers , especially the powers of policing and judicial control .
elections are obviously one method , though campaign financing can be a source of corruption . politicians around the world trade favors for cash needed to win elections , and they often use that cash to buy the votes of desperately poor people .
clear electoral rules and procedures can help ensure transparency , but accountability also comes from the broad society in between elections . privately owned newspapers , independent radio and television networks , trade unions , churches , professional societies , and other groups within civil society provide a bulwark against despotism .
the result is a trap in which poverty causes bad governance and bad governance causes poverty – a two-way spiral downward that can lead to such extreme deprivation that the government , lacking computers , telephones , information systems , and trained civil servants , couldn ’ t function honestly even if it wanted to . the end result can be collapse into a kind of anarchy , as in Liberia , Sierra Leone , and Somalia .
one measure of the quality of governance in over 150 countries is provided by Transparency International , an organization dedicated to strengthening civil society in the fight against government corruption . transparency International produces an annual ranking of “ corruption perceptions , ” measuring the public ’ s view of the extent of corruption in a country .
in the 2005 rankings , Iceland scored as the least corrupt country , with the Scandinavian countries , New Zealand , and Singapore close behind . the US ranked seventeenth from the top , a not-so-glorious position for the world ’ s leading power .
first , Sub-Saharan African countries are less corrupt on average than countries at the same income level in other parts of the world . for example , Burkina Faso , Ghana , Mali , and Rwanda rank much higher than Bangladesh , Indonesia , Pakistan , and Vietnam .
when people have the freedom to assemble , to speak , and to publish their views , society benefits not only by increasing the range of ideas that are debated , but also by keeping corruption in check . it is no surprise that corrupt regimes routinely clamp down on the press , trade unions , and on professional associations .
in general , natural resources like oil , gas , diamonds , and other precious minerals breed corruption , because governments can live off of their export earnings without having to “ compromise ” with their own societies . the natural resources are therefore not only a target of corruption but also an instrument of holding power .
by strengthening civil society – through legal rights and long-term economic development – and instituting clear rules to ensure accountability , political despotism and corruption will be brought under control . we should be uncompromising , therefore , in our defense of civil liberties .
of course , aid should be directed to specific needs – for example , malaria control , food production , safe drinking water , and sanitation – whose fulfillment can be measured and monitored to resist corruption . by raising living standards , we would also be empowering both civil society and impoverished governments to defend the rule of law .
who is Gordon Brown ?
that is his first problem . he has not been elected by anyone – not by the Labour Party , and not by Britain ’ s voters ; he has merely come into an inheritance that he has long thought was his due .
how , then , will Brown acquire legitimacy as Britain ’ s new leader ? the one thing that is clear is that he will not gain legitimacy if he offers only more of what Blair has been dishing up for the past ten years .
political commentators sometimes claim to detect important differences in their underlying political attitudes . however , in practice , Brown has remained in the shadows , skillfully managing the economy , but remaining silent and enigmatic on vital political issues , and apparently endorsing everything Blair did .
if Brown is to gain legitimacy , he must offer something new ; but he can do that only by distinguishing himself from the Blair legacy in clearly perceptible – and therefore fairly radical – ways . this will be a difficult trick to pull off .
perhaps the single most important domestic question Brown faces concerns where he stands on the balance between the free market and the claims of social policy . Blair ’ s government moved the Labour Party a long way to the right of its traditional priorities of protecting the underprivileged , and to justify the change he re-named the party “ New Labour . ”
in many ways , the Blair government ’ s support of free-market policies turned out to be a shrewd and productive shift . Britain ’ s economy grew more steadily and rapidly than it had done for several generations , and the tax revenue generated by growth enabled the government to pour money into education and the National Health Service .
first , inequality has grown at both ends of the income scale . at the bottom , the proportion of the population with an income below the poverty line increased from 13 % at the start of Blair ’ s government to 20 % now .
at the top , the incomes of the mega-rich have soared , with predictable repercussions , especially in the property market . public concern about this issue has been made much worse by claims that the rich get even richer by paying little tax .
there was a time when Brown was thought to be a believer in traditional Labour Party values . was it true ?
unfortunately , Blair and his government are perceived to be tainted by some of the less attractive features of free-market capitalism . Blair himself seems to prefer to have “ friends ” who are very rich and who will lend him their holiday villas in Tuscany .
in reality , of course , the civil and guerrilla war under way in the rest of Iraq means that any security in the south can only be a temporary illusion . the choice facing Brown is whether to cling silently to the existing policy , in the futile hope that the problem will go away , or explicitly recognize Britain ’ s share in the disaster .
Brown believes , and has said , that Britain must always be close friends with America ; and obviously that is the right thing to believe and say . but is he prepared to make clear that there is a difference between being close friends and going into an illegal and disastrous war just to please George W Bush ?
while he has publicly regretted the errors in British intelligence about Saddam Hussein , that is merely a way of shifting the blame from the government to the intelligence services . but it was not the intelligence services that decided to go to war ; it was Tony Blair , with the support of Gordon Brown .
who is to Blame ?
Princeton – Now that the economic crisis looks less threatening ( at least for the moment ) , and forecasters are spying “ green shoots ” of recovery , an ever more encompassing blame game is unfolding . the financial crisis provides an apparently endless opportunity for unmasking deceit , malfeasance , and corruption .
they presided over institutions that made large profits for a substantial period of time by mispricing risk , and then argued for public support on the grounds that they were too big to fail . they appeared arrogant and overpaid , and were easily demonized .
why were the banks not more closely controlled and better regulated ? it is not that politicians were “ bought ” in a simple sense ; rather , they convinced themselves that financial innovation opened the gate to greater general prosperity , increased home ownership , and , of course , popular support in elections .
in Kuwait , the government dismissed parliament . Britain is convulsed by a scandal about parliamentary expenses that has no equivalent since the attacks on “ old corruption ” in the early nineteenth century .
the stock exchange boom of the early 1870 ’ s was followed by collapse in 1873 and a witch-hunt for those responsible . in 1907 , J.P. Morgan was first viewed as the savior of the market , and then as the enemy of the commonweal .
critics are trying to identify the ideas as well as the interests that were responsible for financial and economic dysfunction . in this respect , the contemporary crisis is unlike the historical analogies , in that it looks as if financial innovation was driven by a set of intellectual and even technological innovations .
Larry Summers , now the highly influential director of President Barack Obama ’ s National Economic Council , concluded as a young economist that “ financial and monetary shocks are less important sources of depression than we had suspected . ” If the economy was foolproof , and if so many good policy options existed to deal with crisis and distress , there was less need to avoid mistakes .
other academic disciplines have looked rather smugly at the public humiliation of their colleagues in economics . the non-mathematical appear to have their revenge , as the perils of over-reliance on complex symbolic notation and arcane formulae are relentlessly exposed .
in fact , developments or fashions in other academic disciplines and also in the general culture contributed at least as much to a willingness to engage in absurd risks and to provide and accept valuations of complex and inherently unfathomable securities . the general cultural developments are sometimes termed post-modernism , which involves the replacement of reason by intuition , feeling , and allusion .
in contrast to a steam engine or an old-fashioned automobile , whose operations were easily comprehensible , modern automobiles or airplanes are so complicated that their operators have no idea how the technology they are using actually works . the Internet has created a world in which strict logic is less important than the juxtaposition of striking images .
many people are finding more analogies with medieval life , in which humans were surrounded by processes that they found difficult to comprehend . as a result , they thought they lived in a world populated by demons and mysterious forces .
the recent era of global finance – perhaps we should speak of it as being past ? – differed from the financial surge of a century ago . its cultural manifestations also appeared to be novel .
at the era ’ s height , major financial players built vastly expensive collections of highly abstract modern art . a post-modern neglect or disdain for reality generated the sense that the whole world was constantly shifting and malleable , and might be as transient and meaningless as stock quotations .
an alliance was formed between financial experts who thought they were selling truly innovative ideas , a political elite that endorsed the philosophy of “ regulation lite , ” and a cultural climate that pushed experimentation and the rejection of traditional values . the result was that every sort of value – including financial values – came to be seen as arbitrary and fundamentally absurd .
when incomprehension no longer produces new heights of prosperity , but rather economic collapse and failure , it is not surprising that it turns to anger . finding out who is to blame becomes more and more like the late medieval and early modern search for witches : a way of making sense of a disorderly and hostile universe .
who Lost Turkey ?
that question , often raised in the past , has been heating up in the aftermath of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’ s emotional outburst during the recent World Economic Forum 2009 in Davos , when he abruptly left a panel he was sharing with Israeli President Shimon Peres . and the Turkish question matters greatly , because it touches on some of the most unstable and unsettling of the world ’ s diplomatic disputes .
if Turkey has indeed been “ lost , ” those responsible include the European Union , the United States , Israel , and Turkey itself . the EU ’ s growing reservations about Turkey ’ s membership have been expressed unambiguously by French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
all of these events have disturbed and disoriented Turkey , and are magnified by the domestic impact of worst global economic crisis since the 1930 ’ s .
of course , Turkey ’ s secular , pro-Western elites may still consider the EU and the US important , if not indispensable , allies and partners , and they may consider Islamic fundamentalism , Hamas , Hezbollah , and Iran real or at least potential threats . yet they are also convinced that Europe has behaved improperly toward Turkey , through a combination of short-term populist reflexes and the absence of a long-term strategic vision .
the Turkish question is , of course , complex . Turkey ’ s geography is predominantly Asian , Turkey ’ s emotions are increasingly Middle Eastern , i.e. , Muslim on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , and yet Turkey ’ s elites remain resolutely pro-Western and pro-European .
at the beginning of the twenty-first century , when dialogue with the Islamic world is one of the Western world ’ s key challenges , Europe would commit a historic strategic blunder if it were to close its doors to Turkey . to do so would push back the inheritors of the Ottoman Empire back onto an Asian , Muslim , and Middle Eastern historical trajectory .
in the question of Turkish accession to the EU , the journey matters more than the destination . the reforms that Turkey has already implemented in a very short period of time , thanks to its EU candidate status , are impressive .
the EU desperately needs a strategic and diplomatic partner that can significantly reinforce its clout in the Middle East . Europe also needs the dynamism of a youthful Turkey .
most Europeans do not perceive Turkey as a “ European Other ” but as a “ non-European Other . ” Even in Istanbul , the most Westernized of Turkish cities , as soon as one leaves the main arteries , one seems to be immersed in a Middle Eastern or Asian culture .
far from reinforcing Israel ’ s security , its last two military adventures , in Lebanon and now in Gaza , have caused further self-isolation and loss of world sympathy . nowhere has this phenomenon been stronger than in Turkey , where those military escapades have strained the two countries ’ strategic alliance almost to the breaking point .
it is too early to speak of Obama ’ s policy towards Turkey ; suffice it to say that in his willingness to open a respectful dialogue with Islam , he is the only Western leader to move in the right direction . but can positive American gestures towards Turkey , a key NATO member , be sufficient to offset Israel ’ s insensitive , if not reckless , policies ?
Turkey , too shares some of the responsibility for this mounting process of estrangement . Erdogan ’ s behavior in Davos was , at the very least , irresponsible . he may have gained popularity back home , but in today ’ s difficult economic times , the temptations of cheap populism are more dangerous than ever .
who Needs a Flat Tax ?
Washington , DC – With America ’ s Republican presidential candidates lining up to declare their fealty to a flat tax – a system of personal-income taxation that assesses a single rate for all – opponents have focused on why it is a bad idea to raise taxes on the poor in order to reduce them for the wealthy . but , if a flat tax is such a bad idea , why have so many countries embraced it ?
a careful study of these countries – mainly post-communist countries in Eastern Europe and a smattering of tiny micro-states worldwide – suggests that there are three main reasons . first , some countries are so relatively poor and lacking in domestic capital that they opt to drop rates in order to attract foreign investors .
the United States , like other developed countries , does not suffer from any of these conditions ( yet ) , so it is not clear why it needs a flat tax .
for developed countries that already have capital and a track record of inward investment , “ the appeal of the flat tax is consequently less , ” as a report by the International Monetary Fund concludes . thus , the flat tax has not been adopted in any developed countries , or in China .
here , flat-tax advocates ’ administrative-simplicity arguments have some traction . if a country is so small that it cannot develop a tax administration effective enough to manage a fair system of progressive taxation , then a flat tax may make sense .
moreover , some small countries have other sources of revenue , so the benefit of implementing a progressive tax system does not justify the cost . Tuvalu ’ s government , for example , derives nearly 10 % of its revenues from the sale of rights to its “ .tv ” Internet domain name , which brings in about $ 2 million annually .
finally , if a country ’ s public institutions are in the thrall of oligarchs who are accustomed to stealing with impunity from the public till , a flat tax may be the only way to induce the wealthy to pay any tax at all . thus , in 2001 Russia became the first large state to adopt a flat tax , reducing the top marginal rate from 30 % to 13 % .
that is why its adoption is often associated with an increase in value-added tax rates ( as has occurred throughout Eastern Europe ) . in the US , the Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain ’ s “ 9-9-9 ” plan calls for a 9 % rate for personal and corporate taxes , together with a new 9 % national sales tax .
a country ’ s tax system reflects its institutional capacity , economic circumstances , and distribution of political power . if the US were to become the first developed country to experiment with a flat tax , that shift would tend to confirm what many suspect but hope is not true : that America is broke , desperate for inward investment , incompetently governed , and increasingly ruled by a self-regarding oligarchic elite .
who Needs the Humanities ?
WARWICK , UK – Nowadays , in country after country , policymakers have become obsessed with the need to strengthen science education . but what about the humanities – all those disciplines ( literature , history , languages , and so forth ) whose relevance to economic competitiveness is not so obvious ?
we need the humanities only if we are committed to the idea of humanity . if the humanities have become obsolete , then it may be that humanity is losing its salience .
if anything , we live in a time when traditionally human-centered concerns like “ rights ” have been extended to animals , if not nature as a whole . rather , the problem is whether there is anything distinctive about being human that makes special demands of higher education .
today , it sounds old-fashioned to describe the university ’ s purpose as being to “ cultivate ” people , as if it were a glorified finishing school . however , once we set aside its elitist history , there remains a strong element of truth to this idea , especially when applied to the humanities .
by submitting to a common regime of speaking , writing , reading , observing , and calculating , the “ upright ape ” acquired the capacity to reason in public . this enabled first him and then her to command authority regardless of birth , resulting in the forging of networks and even institutions whose benefits cut deeply across bloodlines .
the result is a “ bigger is better ” mentality that stresses ever more publications , patents , and citations . yet , this agenda tends to be pursued without much concern for how – or if – these measures feed into something of greater social , cultural , and even economic relevance .
the Science Citation Index , originally designed to help researchers discern aggregate trends in increasingly complex subject domains sciences , has helped measure productivity . but now these trends are routinely converted into norms against which the performance of particular universities , departments , and even individual researchers is judged .
an adequate assessment of this capacity requires looking at its multiplier effects . as with John Maynard Keynes ’ s notion that returns on public investment must be measured as the long-term consequence of other investments that it stimulates across the economy and society , so , too , with the knowledge generated by the humanities .
this idea is lost in today ’ s cost accounting for universities , which treats what transpires between teacher and student in the classroom as akin to what happens between producer and consumer in the market . in both cases , it is assumed that the value of the exchanged good is decided shortly after its delivery according to how it satisfies an immediate need .
but the enrichment provided by the humanities was no less enduring , though its subtler nature makes it harder to track . nevertheless , to paraphrase Keynes , every time we turn on the radio or television , read a newspaper , pick up a novel , or watch a movie , we are in the thrall of one or more dead humanists who set the terms of reference through which we see the world .
that some would now question whether the humanities have any impact at all merely reflects the crude and short-sighted way in which the value of academic knowledge is measured and judged today . perhaps that befits creatures whose lives are “ solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short , ” to recall Thomas Hobbes ’ description of the state of nature .
who Needs to Be EU President ?
if it is someone of worldwide renown , the presidency will immediately be established as a post of global importance . but if its first occupant is not a household name , the presidency will be doomed as just another of the European Union ’ s confusing plethora of worthy senior positions that are neither valued nor understood outside Brussels .
the key point here is that Europe won ’ t be able to upgrade the job later . if the presidency goes to a politician who lacks fame and charisma , its place will forever be low down in the international pecking order .
of the half-dozen candidates to become “ Europe ’ s President , ” only Tony Blair needs no introduction anywhere . all the other names in the ring have to be accompanied by a description – the former Finnish this or Austrian that .
nobody knows whether the current prime ministers of the EU ’ s 27 member countries will choose Blair . there is considerable lingering ill will over his role in the invasion of Iraq , and there is the inconvenient fact that he is from Euro-skeptic Britain , and that many on the left view him as a leader whose “ third way ” was a betrayal of socialism .
but choosing a president for Europe isn ’ t about Blair the man , or about the political records of any of the others who would like the job . it is about the job itself .
it is now in the final stages of its long and difficult birth , and by the New Year should be bringing new mechanisms to bear to streamline European decision-making . the jewel in its crown is to be the appointment for a 30-month term of a full-time president of the European Council , which groups the heads of EU member governments , along with a foreign policy chief who will be backed by an embryonic EU diplomatic service .
Europe has an international image problem that in part stems from a complex institutional structure that non-EU countries find baffling . it is over-represented at G-20 world summits , for instance , but the presence of four European national leaders , plus EU representatives like Barroso , weakens rather than strengthens its political weight .
the result is that Europe ’ s achievements in recent years – its expansion to create a single economic market of 500 million people and its creation of the euro as a currency that challenges the dollar – are not accompanied by a significantly greater global standing . world leaders from Barack Obama to Hu Jintao address themselves to Berlin , Paris , and London , rather than to Brussels .
the text of the Lisbon treaty is studiously vague in its job description of the president ’ s role – an approach that prevented trouble for treaty ’ s framers , but merely postponed disagreement . the real argument now taking place between Europe ’ s national governments is about the authority that the EU ’ s president should have .
who Owns Bolivia ?
a few months ago , Evo Morales became Bolivia ‘ s first democratically elected indigenous head of state . indigenous groups constitute 62 % of Bolivia ’ s population , and those with mixed blood another 30 % , but for 500 years Bolivians had been ruled by colonial powers and their descendants .
perhaps surprising for modern politicians , Morales took his words seriously . genuinely concerned about raising the incomes of his desperately poor people , he recognized that Bolivia needs foreigners ’ expertise to achieve growth , and that this entails paying fairly for their services .
Morales ’ actions are widely supported by Bolivians , who see the so-called privatizations ( or “ capitalizations ” ) under former President Gonzalo “ Goni ” Sanchez de Lozada as a rip-off : Bolivia received only 18 % of the proceeds ! Bolivians wonder why investments of some $ 3 billion should entitle foreign investors to 82 % of the country ’ s vast gas reserves , now estimated to be worth $ 250 billion .
to most Bolivians , what is at stake is a matter of fairness : should foreign oil and gas companies get a fair return on their capital , or a supernormal return ? should Bolivia be paid a fair value for its resources ?
indeed , because Bolivia ’ s Constitution requires the approval of Congress for such sales , it isn ’ t clear that Morales is nationalizing anything : the assets were never properly sold . when a country is robbed of a national art treasure , we don ’ t call its return “ re-nationalization , ” because it belonged to the country all along .
as with many privatizations elsewhere , there are questions as to whether the foreign investors have kept their side of the bargain . Bolivia contributed to these joint enterprises not only with resources , but also with previous investments .
around the world , oil and gas companies have themselves to blame : too often , they have resisted calls for greater transparency . in the future , companies and countries should agree on a simple principle : there should be , to paraphrase President Woodrow Wilson ’ s memorable words , “ open contracts , openly and transparently arrived at . ”
if the Bolivians do not get fair value for their country ’ s natural wealth , their prospects are bleak . even if they do , they will need assistance , not only to extract their resources , but also to improve the health and education of all Bolivians – to ensure long-term economic growth and social welfare .
for now , the world should celebrate the fact that Bolivia has a democratically elected leader attempting to represent the interests of the poor people of his country . it is a historic moment .
who Pays for Bird Flu ?
fifty years ago , American chicken farmers found that by keeping their birds in sheds they could produce chickens for the table more cheaply and with less work than by traditional farmyard methods . the new method spread : chickens disappeared from fields into long , windowless sheds .
it isn ’ t called “ factory farming ” merely because those sheds look like factories . everything about the production method is geared towards turning live animals into machines for converting grain into meat or eggs at the lowest possible cost .
walk into such a shed – if the producer will let you – and you will find up to 30,000 chickens . the National Chicken Council , the trade association for the US chicken industry , recommends a stocking density of 85 square inches per bird – less than a standard sheet of typing paper .
when this grain , which humans could eat directly , is fed to chickens , they use some of it to create bones and feathers and other body parts that we cannot eat . so we get less food back than we put into the birds – and less protein , too – while disposing of the concentrated chicken manure causes serious pollution to rivers and ground water .
the air in the sheds is high in ammonia from bird feces , which are usually allowed to pile up for months – and in some cases for a year or more – before being cleaned out . medical experts warn that because the birds are routinely fed antibiotics to keep them growing in such crowded , filthy , and stressful conditions , antibiotic-resistant bacteria could cause a public-health threat .
yet , despite these well-founded criticisms , over the last 20 years factory farming – not only of chickens , but also of pigs , veal calves , dairy cows , and , in outdoor feedlots , cattle – has spread rapidly in developing countries , especially in Asia . now we are discovering that the consequences may be far more deadly than we ever imagined .
as University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown put it after a Canadian outbreak of avian influenza , “ high-intensity chicken rearing is a perfect environment for generating virulent avian flu viruses . ”
other experts agree . in October 2005 , a United Nations task force identified as one of the root causes of the bird flu epidemic , “ farming methods which crowd huge numbers of animals into small spaces . ”
supporters of factory farming often point out that bird flu can be spread by free-range flocks , or by wild ducks and other migrating birds , who may join the free-range birds to feed with them or drop their feces while flying overhead . but , as Brown has pointed out , viruses found in wild birds are generally not very dangerous .
on the contrary , it is only when these viruses enter a high-density poultry operation that they mutate into something far more virulent . by contrast , birds that are reared by traditional methods are likely to have greater resistance to disease than the stressed , genetically similar birds kept in intensive confinement systems .
so far , a relatively small number of human beings have died from the current strain of avian influenza , and it appears that they have all been in contact with infected birds . but if the virus mutates into a form that is transmissible between humans , the number of deaths could run into the hundreds of millions .
recently , the US Senate approved spending $ 8 billion to stockpile vaccines and other drugs to help prevent a possible bird flu epidemic . other governments have already spent tens of millions on vaccines and other preventive measures .
factory farming spread because it seemed to be cheaper than more traditional methods . in fact , it was cheaper only because it passed some of its costs on to others – for example , to people who lived downstream or downwind from the factory farms , and could no longer enjoy clean water and air .
factory farming is passing far bigger costs – and risks – on to all of us . in economic terms , these costs should be “ internalized ” by the factory farmers rather than being shifted onto the rest of us .
that won ’ t be easy to do , but we could make a start by imposing a tax on factory-farm products until enough revenue is raised to pay for the precautions that governments now have to take against avian influenza . then we might finally see that chicken from the factory farm really isn ’ t so cheap after all .
the US Still Runs the World
in the 1980s , Japan was widely regarded as on the verge of overtaking the US ; today , after more than two decades of Japanese stagnation , no one would take this scenario seriously . and in the 1990s , monetary union was considered likely to propel Europe to greater global prominence ; today , the European economy is frequently in the world ’ s headlines , but not in a good way .
until recently , China , in many people ’ s view , was poised to assume global leadership , if it hadn ’ t done so already . today , doubts about the Chinese economy ’ s long-term prospects are rattling stock markets worldwide ( including in the US ) .
China matters , and its economic policy , including how the exchange rate is managed , must be taken seriously . but China does not run the world , and it is unlikely to do so anytime soon .
the best case for taking China seriously as a world power is made in Arvind Subramanian ’ s best-selling book Eclipse : living in the Shadow of China ’ s Economic Dominance , published in 2011 . ( the author , now Chief Economic Adviser at India ’ s finance ministry , and I were colleagues and sometimes co-authors at the International Monetary Fund and the Peterson Institute for International Economics . )
one hopes that the Indian government will heed Subramanian ’ s account of how China grew through exports of manufactured goods and associated productivity improvements . China also became integrated into global supply chains – producing things for companies elsewhere – on a previously unimaginable scale , and Chinese managers learned how to make better products .
China ran a very large current-account surplus during the early 2000s and accumulated a vast stock of foreign reserves – including at least several trillion dollars ’ worth of US Treasury debt . although this looks impressive on paper , reserves of this magnitude are essentially useless .
in retrospect , that was one of the great non-events of the twentieth century . similarly , Americans will most likely look back on China ’ s accumulation of US government debt and simply shrug .
for reasons that are still debated , the renminbi became massively undervalued ; exports were much higher than imports , and the current-account surplus reached more than 10 % of GDP . instead of letting the renminbi appreciate and gradually reducing their reliance on export markets , the Chinese authorities preferred to accumulate foreign reserves ( US Treasury debt ) .
now China has to figure out a way to sustain growth when demand in the rest of the world is sluggish . a return to a substantially undervalued exchange rate would almost certainly provoke an international response , including from the US Congress .
and there are reasons to be concerned – particularly when some US politicians refuse to acknowledge the nature of America ’ s global role . for example , the US built the world ’ s trading and monetary system 70 years ago , but now Republicans in Congress refuse to support change at the IMF – including sensible reforms that almost all other countries favor .
still , it is the US that is currently leading the push for freer trade across the Pacific and a substantial reduction in barriers to trade with Europe . if America gets the rules right – favoring ordinary citizens , rather than footloose corporations – its trade initiatives will make a major contribution to global growth and its own prosperity .
as US monetary officials gather for their annual Jackson Hole conclave , they will consider myriad relevant dimensions of the global economy . but the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will move interest rates based almost entirely on its collective read of US economic circumstances .
who \ u0027s Afraid of Al Jazeera ?
you can practically see the blood of US officials boil when they discuss it . to be sure , in the context of the dream of all Arabs being united and independent of foreign control , Al Jazeera is undeniably partial to Arab aspirations .
in fact , Al Jazeera , which US Secretary of State Colin Powell calls &quot; horrible &quot; and &quot; slanted , &quot; is a pivotal vehicle for reform and change , which genuinely democratic Arab activists and the international community alike have been calling for . so incensed has America been , however , that it created its own Arabic language mouthpiece in the form of satellite station Al Hurra .
it demonstrated its lapdog status by never broadcasting images of prisoners being abused inside Baghdad &apos;s notorious Abu Ghraib prison . in this respect , at least , Al Hurra fits perfectly within the tame tradition of Arab state broadcasters .
America , however , is not alone in challenging Al Jazeera head on . the BBC , which briefly ran its own Arabic language news station in the mid-1990 &apos;s - before closing it down because its Saudi funders were unhappy with its reporting - recently announced that it will re-launch an Arabic language news satellite station .
but instead of bashing or seeking to undermine Al Jazeera , politicians should encourage this bastion of free expression , recognizing that Arabs will need to endure a messy process on the way to democracy . along that tortuous route , the world &apos;s major powers are bound to be offended , probably quite regularly .
television in the Arab world has for years been the mouthpiece used by ruling presidents , kings , and emirs to propagate their official opinions and nothing else . elite military units usually protect radio and television stations , because they have often been the first targets in military coups .
given this history , and the storm of calls for reform in the Arab world , it is a tragic irony that America and the West have paid so little attention to the terrestrial Arab monopoly television channels . indeed , US criticism of Al Jazeera sounds more like special pleading because of America &apos;s inept bumbling in Iraq than a genuine desire for free , open , and critical Arab media .
if democracy means giving people a free choice , then there is no doubt that the choice of most Arabs is for a television broadcaster that reflects their aspirations . in this sense , Al Jazeera is clearly biased , because it is run by Arab patriots and reflects Arab sentiment .
in fact , Al Jazeera was founded only after the BBC closed its Arabic language station under Saudi pressure . Al Jazeera &apos;s motto , &quot; opinion and opposing opinion , &quot; has galvanized Arab viewers , because clashing opinions are rarely heard on terrestrial Arab television stations .
but it did not make up facts ; it merely reflected majority Arab opinion . on such fundamental issues of Arab consensus , it is simply illogical to expect an Arab broadcaster to be even-handed .
in July , Al Jazeera became the first Arab TV station to create a professional code of ethics . according to the BBC , the code defines with absolute clarity and transparency how Al-Jazeera journalists are to behave , and sets clear divisions between news , analysis , and commentary .
as for Al Jazeera &apos;s journalistic performance , it is past time that the station be judged by respected professional journalists , not by US or other officials with a policy axe to grind . a major university department of journalism working with Arab media critics , for example , could provide a much more honest analysis of the station &apos;s work .
if American , British , and other Western officials are serious about reform in the Arab world , they must support reform-minded Arab individuals and organizations , even if those organizations make them uncomfortable at times . if that becomes the West &apos;s standard , Al Jazeera will rightly be seen as part of the solution , not part of the problem .
who ’ s Dependent Now ?
if the late great Argentine economist Raul Prebisch were alive today , he no doubt would wonder whether the world had turned upside down . his hugely influential “ dependency ” theory argued that if poor countries relied too much on commodity exports , they would never achieve the industrial depth needed to sustain rapid growth .
relentless efficiency gains in agriculture and resource extraction pushed down prices for commodities , especially during the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s . with few exceptions , countries that focused on commodity exports performed dismally , whereas many resource-poor Asian countries raced ahead .
today , however , with Asia ’ s giants , India and China , joining the global economy , prices for oil , gold , wheat , and virtually every other commodity are exploding . while there will always be cycles – oil prices , for example , will probably fall before they start rising again – the long-run trend for many commodities will clearly remain upward for some time to come .
what many trade negotiators and other policymakers do not seem to have recognized yet , though Prebisch would have realized it instantly , is that this dramatic turn of events carries huge implications for the global balance of power . indeed , perhaps no other aspect of economic globalization will pose greater challenges to world leaders over the coming decades .
are they prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence to commodity producers as they become much wealthier ? how will the world ’ s two superpowers , China and the United States , come to terms with the fact that important commodity-exporting regions from Africa to the Middle East to Central Asia are littered with ill-formed nation states ?
some self-anointed seers portray the problem as being one of finite natural resources , with the world running out of critical commodities at an alarming rate . nowadays , there are many adherents of the “ Hubbert ’ s peak ” theory of oil production , which holds that we have reached the upper limits of output capacity , the wells are running dry , and it is all downhill from here .
however , as leading oil historian Dan Yergin points out , prophets of doom have declared that the world is running out of oil at least four times already . each time , radical improvements in technology made the threat evaporate .
world War I , of course , was partly set off by Germany ’ s concern that the other colonial powers had locked up too large a share of world oil and commodity supplies . similarly , in World War II , Japan feared for the stability of its foreign supplies of oil and other natural resources .
fortunately , this does not seem likely for the moment , especially given the Chinese leadership ’ s sober and pragmatic approach to its resource problems . the Chinese are looking to regions like Africa , hoping to find stable trading partners .
but this is basically a joke : self-indulgent , maybe , but self-sufficient , never . much of the Arab world understandably views the invasion of Iraq as the cornerstone of the real US strategy for securing stable energy supplies .
meanwhile , commodity prices will continue to rise , with oil exporters now constituting the largest contributors to America ’ s gaping trade deficit . maybe the real US strategy is to try to owe the commodity-exporting countries so much money that they will feel dependent on making America happy !
whose Champions , Anyway ?
the links between states and companies have grabbed headlines , most recently in Russia , where President Vladimir Putin seems obsessed with creating “ national champions ” in the energy and aerospace sectors . such efforts seem but a part of a surge of protectionism in European political debate about business , especially when it comes to cross-border acquisitions .
“ Economic patriotism , ” the slogan coined by France ’ s Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin following PepsiCo ’ s rumored attempt in July 2005 to takeover Danone , perhaps best encapsulates the political imperative . although de Villepin ’ s speeches are more flamboyant than those of most political leaders , the underlying sentiment extends far beyond France .
the same impulse appears to be at work behind Italy ’ s policy on Autostrade , Spain ’ s on Endesa , Poland ’ s on its banking sector , the former Swedish Prime Minister ’ s on Volvo , German unease about “ locust ” -like funds on Deutsche Börse , or the United Kingdom ’ s ever louder defense of the London Stock Exchange ’ s independence from the United States .
the basic belief that underpins “ economic patriotism ” is that of an alignment of interests between companies considered “ national ” ( most prominently the largest ones or so-called “ champions ” ) , their national employees , and the national community . according to de Villepin , “ to defend the employees ’ interests well , we must protect the interests of our companies . ”
in fact , the link between European companies and national communities is becoming more tenuous by the day . research that I carried out for Bruegel surveyed the largest 100 listed companies headquartered in Europe ( ranked by market capitalization ) and analyzed the geographical distribution of their revenue , which is increasingly transparent since the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) last year .
Europe was divided into eight broad zones , comprising individual countries like Germany , France , and Italy , or groupings of smaller countries such as Benelux and the Nordic area . the survey then calculated the share of revenue earned by each company in the zone in which it is headquartered ( or “ home base ” ) , the rest of Europe , and the rest of the world .
the results show that the share of the home base in total revenue has become , on average , relatively low : just three-eighths , or 37.5 % , on average for Europe ’ s largest 100 companies . of course , this figure covers a wide diversity of industries , and also some geographical differences across the continent .
for a broadly representative sub-sample of 55 companies that could be tracked since 1997 , the proportion of revenue generated in the home region has fallen sharply on average , from 50.2 % to 36.9 % . for these companies , sales to the “ rest of Europe , ” which represented an average of less than 30 % of total European sales in 1997 , rose above 43 % in 2005 .
if the trend is extrapolated , the home bases of Europe ’ s largest companies will account , on average , for less than half of their European revenue , and less than a third of their global revenue , before the end of this decade . these companies are “ Europeanizing ” fast , and the relative weight of their home base is declining even faster .
put simply , the numbers show a growing gap of interests between these so-called “ champions ” and their national home bases . for Europe ’ s governments , fostering champions increasingly means providing benefits to non-national customers and employees – a dubious use of taxpayer money .
another consequence is that regulatory competition is likely to increase in Europe , as companies are less bound by local interests to keep their headquarters at “ home ” if the tax or regulatory environment becomes unfavorable . the decision by Depfa Bank to shift its headquarters from Wiesbaden to Dublin in 2002 may be a sign of things to come .
the biggest risk is that the growing disconnect between the perception of “ national ” companies and the reality of Europeanization may lead to spectacularly ill-judged policies . it is high time for business leaders to be more candid about where their real constituencies lie , and for national politicians to recognize that they can no longer wield control over the giants of today ’ s European business .
whose Corporate Social Responsibility ?
new YORK – Increasingly , corporations are under pressure , often from activist non-governmental organizations , to take on specific “ corporate social responsibility ” ( CSR ) obligations . but the fact that CSR is being demanded , and occasionally conceded , does not ensure clarity about either its rationale or the ways in which it should be undertaken .
CSR can be divided into two categories : what corporations should do ( say , contribute to a women ’ s rights NGO or build a village school ) and what they should not do ( say , dump mercury into rivers or bury hazardous materials in landfills ) . the latter is wholly conventional and subject to regulation ( and recently to questions about how corporations should behave when there are no host-country regulations ) .
altruism , where it existed , also was undertaken by the family , which decided how and on what to spend its money . whether the firm or its shareholders and other stakeholders spent the money was beside the point .
with the rise of the business corporation , large family firms have generally disappeared . but that does not mean that a corporation is the right entity to engage in altruism – though its various stakeholders obviously can spend any portion of the income they earn from the corporation and other sources in altruistic ways .
one can also argue for PSR on the grounds that asking for CSR becomes a way of “ passing the buck ” – evading personal responsibility for doing good . this is the flip side of blaming corporations for everything from obesity to scalding from spilled coffee – both the subject of lawsuits in recent years .
there is also an added advantage in replacing CSR with PSR : there is virtue in diversity of approaches to altruism . Chairman Mao wanted a hundred flowers to bloom , but only so that he could cut them all off at their roots .
moreover , it is hard to see how a corporation ’ s stakeholders can always arrive democratically at a common position on how the corporation should engage in social responsibility on their behalf . each will consider his or her CSR view the best .
first , the political reality is that society treats corporations as if they were persons , which is often also a legal reality for many purposes . society increasingly demands that these “ corporate citizens ” be altruistic , just as people are .
second , many corporations view CSR as an effective defensive strategy against powerful activist NGOs ( such as Greenpeace ) that have taken to using online agitation , boycotts , and other means to “ blackmail ” targeted corporations into acceding to the activists ’ demands . the more CSR a company can point to , the less such efforts will succeed – or even be mounted .
Coke has been targeted by NGOs for alleged lapses in labor and environmental standards . by contrast , Pepsi , which once teamed up with AT &amp; amp ; T and the CIA to oust President Salvador Allende in Chile , smells like a rose nowadays , because it has distributed CSR largesse to several causes that influential NGOs embrace .
in 2005 , the Service Employees ’ International Union ( SEIU ) created Wal-Mart Watch , with an annual budget of $ 5 million . the purpose was to make Wal-Mart a “ better employer , neighbor , and corporate citizen , ” and Wal-Mart eventually capitulated on some of the SEIU ’ s specific demands as well .
a benign example is Adidas ’ s sponsorship of tennis tournaments . a malign example is Philip Morris ’ s donation of money to museums , symphony orchestras , and opera houses , cynically aimed at buying off artists who might otherwise work to ban cigarettes .
all these rationales for CSR suggest that it should be left to each corporation to determine , just as PSR leaves altruism to each individual ’ s conscience and sense of what needs supporting . the attempt by some NGOs and activists to impose a straitjacket on CSR , reflecting their priorities , is misguided and must be rejected .
instead , the model should be former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan ’ s initiative , the Global Compact . what Annan has done is to embrace ten wide-ranging guiding principles while leaving signatory corporations free to choose that which they wish to support actively .
whose Georgia ?
with popular dissent growing and opposition forces strengthening , the authorities have sought to controll non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) and strengthen the security forces . but this will only make mass protests inevitable , ultimately jeopardizing the democratic transition in Georgia that Saakashvili claims to represent .
Saakashvili sees a “ Moscow hand ” in every challenge to his authority , which could be explained by his government ’ s close alliance with the United States . but the people rounded up in the latest raid against the opposition were originally imprisoned by Eduard Shevarnadze ’ s government , which Saakashvili helped depose in Georgia ’ s supposedly democratic “ Rose revolution ” in 2003 .
the latest events clearly indicate that a czarist mentality survived the revolution , reflected in a Byzantine model of political power — an emperor and his court — that has as its main vehicle largely unconstrained presidential authority . before the security forces targeted the opposition bloc that I represent , supporters of educational reforms were prosecuted , while most of the press is under the influence of the government .
and , in supporting the Western model of parliamentariansm , we are on the side of Georgia , not Russia . it is strange that Saakashvili , a graduate of Columbia Law School , fails to see the disparity between his own democratic rhetoric and autocratic actions .
thus , those of us who value Georgia ’ s historical ties with Russia are called , at best , “ archaists , ” and at worst “ enemies of Georgian independence , ” as if Georgia would become a Russian colony if we ever came to power . but what separates us from Saakashvili is that we understand that history , geography , and economics dictate close ties to Russia .
the unfortunate paradox in Georgia – and elsewhere in the post-Soviet world – is that self-serving pro-Western rhetoric has often led democratic values to be sacrificed in favor of a new dictatorship . when the West actively supports popular revolutions , as in Georgia and Ukraine , the newly established power relies on democratic slogans , not democratic behavior .
first with Shevarnadze , and now with Saakashvili , popular disillusionment reflects not rejection of democracy , but frustration with its continuing absence . Saakashvili is evidently mesmerized by the US , and the West in general , but what is the point if there is no independent and democratic political process in Georgia today ?
we believe that Georgia should pursue its own interests , which it may share with Europe , Russia , or the US , but which are nonetheless our own . we have no interest in merely executing US policy , or in basing Georgia ’ s foreign and domestic policy solely on distancing the country from Russia , as Saakashvili has done .
but nationalism suggests the lack of a coherent conception of Georgia ’ s interests . Georgia ’ s tradition as a multinational , tolerant state , which has been weakened in the last 15 years , must be reinvigorated , because we have no need for enemies against which to define ourselves .
it is a small , poor country that desperately needs stability and economic development . its model should not be Palestine and permanent battle , but Switzerland and permanent prosperity .
whose War on Terror ?
“ We are all Americans , ” wrote Le Monde on September 12 , 2001 . and so it was with most people in the Muslim world , who were as appalled as anyone else at the carnage of the terrorist attacks on Washington and New York . indeed , when America responded to the attacks , almost no one mourned the fall of the Taliban , who were universally condemned for their fanaticism .
in the five years since the attacks , two audiences for the so-called “ war on terror ” have emerged . indeed , as the “ war ” progressed , the audience closest to the action began to see the emerging combat in a way that was diametrically opposed to that of the United States and the West .
the Bush administration , having proclaimed a war on terror , invaded and occupied countries , and yet failed to see that these events were being linked in the eyes of people in the region . glued to Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite channels , the various battles of the “ war on terror ” came to be viewed as a single chain of events in a grand plot against Islam .
worse yet , America waved the banner of democracy as it prosecuted its wars . but hopes for democracy , be it secular or Islamist , for the people concerned have been buried in the rubble and carnage of Baghdad , Beirut , and Kandahar .
many Muslims understand – as well as anyone in the West , and in the same terms – the underlying causes of the alienation that animates Islamic radicalism and violence . they know that the rigid dictatorships of the region have paralyzed their populations . only those consumed by the fires of their rage seem able to melt the shackles of these authoritarian societies .
but the price of escape is a kind of deformation . embittered , fanatical , vengeful : those who rebel against the status quo enter the wider world seeking retaliation , not just against the regimes that deformed them , but against the West , which propped up the region ’ s authoritarians in the interest of “ stability . ”
many Muslims also understand that the problem of Palestine , unsolved for three generations , goes beyond the suffering of the Palestinian people . they know that the region ’ s dictators have used Palestine to justify their misrule and to avoid political and economic liberalization .
so when America called for democracy , the hearts of many in the region soared with the hope that reform would come at last . but America , as so many times before , let them down . as people at last began to hope for more liberal and decent societies , the US continued to endorse the regimes that were repressing them . America simply could not adhere to its own democracy-promotion script .
after the ouster of the Taliban in Afghanistan , the US turned its sights on the secular dictatorship of Saddam Hussein ’ s Iraq . instead of encouraging reform of the Saudi / Wahhabi regime – the system that spawned 15 of the 19 hijackers in the 9 / 11 attacks – the average Muslim saw America as waging war on a regime that had nothing to do with that crime .
almost from the moment of Saddam ’ s fall , Saudi / Wahhabi jihadis poured into Iraq almost unimpeded . worse yet , the Muslims who supported the project to democratize Iraq widely suspect that the Sunni resistance that incited the Iraqi civil war has been financed by Saudi oil money .
so the effort to democratize Iraq – indeed , the entire American project to democratize the region – has fallen under deep suspicion by even the most moderate of Muslims . America , they believe , only wants a democracy that suits its interests .
but until the West stops regarding dead babies as political props , we cannot understand how the Muslim world perceives all that has happened since September 11 , 2001 . only then will we understand why the unified view of five years ago has fractured so violently .
whose World Bank ?
new YORK – US President Barack Obama ’ s nomination of Jim Yong Kim for the presidency of the World Bank has been well received – and rightly so , especially given some of the other names that were bandied about . in Kim , a public-health professor who is now President of Dartmouth College and previously led the World Health Organization ’ s HIV / AIDS department , the United States has put forward a good candidate .
both are first-rate , have served as ministers with multiple portfolios , have performed admirably in top positions in multilateral organizations , and have the diplomatic skills and professional competence to do an outstanding job . they understand finance and economics , the bread and butter of the World Bank , and have a network of connections to leverage the Bank ’ s effectiveness .
Ocampo , like Kim , brings the advantages and disadvantages of being an outsider ; but Ocampo , a distinguished professor at Columbia University , is thoroughly acquainted with the World Bank . he previously served not only as minister of economics and finance , but also of agriculture – a critically important qualification , given that the vast majority of the developing countries ’ poor depend on farming .
both Okonjo-Iweala and Ocampo understand the role of international financial institutions in providing global public goods . throughout their careers , their hearts and minds have been devoted to development , and to fulfilling the World Bank ’ s mission of eliminating poverty .
Kim ’ s specialty , public health , is critical , and the Bank has long supported innovative initiatives in this field . but health is only a small part of the Bank ’ s “ portfolio , ” and it typically works in this area with partners who bring to the table expertise in medicine .
rumors suggest that the US is likely to insist on maintaining the perverse selection process in which it gets to pick the World Bank ’ s president , simply because , in this election year , Obama ’ s opponents would trumpet loss of control over the choice as a sign of weakness . and it is more important for the US to retain that control than it is for emerging and developing countries to obtain it .
indeed , the more powerful of the emerging markets know how to live within the current system , and they may use it to their advantage . they will , in effect , obtain an IOU , to be cashed in for something that is more important .
for years , the Bank ’ s effectiveness was compromised because it was seen , in part , as a tool of Western governments and their countries ’ financial and corporate sectors . ironically , even America ’ s long-term interests would be best served by a commitment – not just in words , but also in deeds – to a merit-based system and good governance .
one supposed achievement of the G-20 was an agreement to reform the governance of the international financial institutions – most importantly , how their leaders are selected . since expertise on development by and large lies within the emerging and developing countries – after all , they live development – it seems natural that the World Bank ’ s head would come from one of those countries .
while the US , the international community , and the Bank itself repeatedly emphasize the importance of good governance , a selection procedure that de facto leaves the appointment to the US president makes a mockery of it .
Okonjo-Iweala put the matter forcefully in an interview with the Financial Times : what is at stake is a matter of hypocrisy . the integrity of the advanced industrial countries , which have a majority of the votes at the World Bank , is being put to the test .
who Should Be Helped First ?
the list of urgent challenges facing humanity is depressingly long . AIDS , hunger , armed conflict , and global warming compete for attention alongside government failure , malaria , and the latest natural disaster .
to some , making such priorities seems obscene . but the United Nations and national governments spend billions of dollars each year trying to help those in need without explicitly considering whether they are achieving the most that they can .
the western media focuses on a tsunami in Asia ; donations flow freely . an earthquake that devastates Pakistan garners fewer headlines , so the developed world gives a lot less .
there is a better way . we could prioritize our spending to achieve the greatest benefit for our money .
this month , I will ask UN ambassadors how they would spend $ 50 billion to reduce suffering . they will repeat the same exercise that some of the world ’ s best economists tackled in a 2004 project called the “ Copenhagen Consensus ” : weighing up solutions to the great challenges facing the world , and deciding what should be done first .
we must all engage in the debate . one hopes that this task has been made slightly simpler by the publication of a book in which the Copenhagen Consensus economists boil down their insights .
here ’ s one fact to consider : the entire death toll from the Southeast Asian tsunami is matched each month by the number of worldwide casualties of HIV / AIDS . a comprehensive prevention program providing free or cheap condoms and information about safe sex to the regions worst affected by HIV / AIDS would cost $ 27 billion and save more than 28 million lives .
other options that the economists favored spending some of their $ 50 billion include providing micro-nutrients to the world ’ s hungry , establishing free trade , and battling malaria with mosquito nets and medication . at the other end of the scale , responses to climate change like the Kyoto Protocol would cost more than they would achieve , so the economists crossed them off the list of things to do right now .
there are many interested parties . no group wants their solution to come last , and no government wants its country ’ s national challenges to be overlooked .
but it shows that there is a will to put prioritization squarely at the center of attention . it will produce a “ to do ” list that will demonstrate how to achieve the most that we can for humanity , which could lead , in turn , to more transparent decision-making .
the principles of economics provide a sound basis on which to make rational choices . now , the discussion needs to shift from the academic sphere to political life .
we must endeavor to shorten the list of challenges facing humanity . but that requires all of us to engage in a debate about what we need to do first .
who Should Lead the IMF ?
as recently as three years ago , many observers thought that the Fund had outlived its usefulness and should be closed down . since then , it has intervened in Hungary , Latvia , Iceland , and Ukraine , among other crisis-stricken countries – and has received a massive infusion of new resources .
it has suggested that central banks may want to consider higher inflation targets in order to avoid hitting the zero bound in the event of deflationary shocks . for this , it drew a stern reproach from Germany ’ s Bundesbank – a clear sign that it is doing something right .
the IMF has also put in place a Flexible Credit Line to disburse funds quickly – and free of onerous conditions – to countries buffeted by financial crosswinds through no fault of their own . the problem is that , despite its alluring name , the new facility has had few takers , and no Asian takers in particular .
indeed , it is revealing that when South Korea was desperate for dollars following the failure of Lehman Brothers , it borrowed from the United States Federal Reserve , not from the Fund . after their experience in 1997-1998 , Korean policymakers would sooner jump off a cliff than borrow , even without conditions , from the IMF .
nevertheless , while not all is sweetness and light , there has been progress . and for this the IMF ’ s strong , politically astute management – not exactly something from which the Fund has regularly benefited in recent years – deserves credit .
now , however , the rumor mill is heating up with gossip that the Fund ’ s managing director , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , will leave in order to oppose Nikolas Sarkozy in the 2012 French presidential elections . Sarkozy ’ s popularity is hitting new lows , and Strauss-Kahn ’ s friends say that he has never made a secret of his political ambitions .
a lame-duck managing director would hamstring the Fund . already there is a sense that the IMF is reluctant to tell Europe more forcefully how to handle its problem with Greece because the managing director must be careful to avoid meddling in Europe ’ s internal politics .
on top of this now comes the interesting news that the IMF has appointed Zhu Min , previously a deputy governor of the People ’ s Bank of China , as special adviser to Strauss-Kahn . Zhu will thus be part of the core management team .
it is the turn of someone from outside Europe to head the IMF – Europe having had a monopoly on the position since the Fund was created following World War II . the bargain then was that the US could pick the president of the World Bank while the Europeans would get the top slot at the IMF ( US policymakers in their wisdom believing that the Bank would become the more important institution ) .
it is no longer dominated by the Atlantic economies , so those economies should no longer dictate who holds the top jobs at the two Bretton Woods institutions . it is now , the argument goes , another region ’ s turn .
it is the region to which the world ’ s economic center of gravity is shifting . if you ask Asian leaders what would make them consider again approaching the Fund after their traumatic experience with IMF “ assistance ” in 1997-1998 , they will answer : an Asian managing director .
the best way to ensure that the Fund remains open to new ideas is by selecting the person with the best ideas to lead it . the best way to ensure that the IMF ’ s management is accountable to all of its governmental shareholders is to prevent the top job from becoming the sinecure of any region , whether Europe or Asia .
the next managing director should be selected on the merits , not on the basis of nationality . there should be an open competition , in which the best candidate wins on the basis of his or her ideas .
Asia has plenty of competent economic officials who might be considered as the next managing director of the IMF . but just because they are Asian is not reason enough to select them .
समलैंगिक पुरुषों को जोखिम-पूर ् व रोग-निवारण ( PrEP ) के लिए तैयार करना

who ’ s Who on Putin ’ s Payroll ?
Moscow – Germany ’ s ex-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is a legend in Russia . he serves Gazprom ’ s interests for a measly couple of million euros a year , sits in at sessions of the Russian Academy of Sciences , and writes books about his staunch friendship with “ Genosse Wladimir , ” who , in the not-so-distant past , earned himself the well-deserved nickname of “ Stasi ” among business circles in gangster-ridden St. Petersburg .
the two of them are building , or trying to build , the Nord Stream gas pipeline , an exceptionally costly project that satisfies twin strategic objectives . Demonstratively hostile to the interests of both Belarus and Ukraine , the pipeline is intended to ensure that these countries are under Russia ’ s energy thumb , regardless of who is in power in Minsk and Kiev .
as a bonus , the pipeline will also consolidate the Russian economy ’ s status as an appendage of Germany ’ s – its supplier of natural resources . certain of Schroeder ’ s predecessors as German chancellor sought to attain the same objective by rather different means .
the Kremlin ’ s achievements in securing the help of Americans willing to offer their influence are equally impressive . indeed , the Obama administration ’ s Russia policy is being nurtured with advice from people who have no official position in the administration but close business ties to Russia and the Kremlin : Henry Kissinger , James A. Baker , Thomas Graham , and Dimitri Simes .
Baker is a consultant for the two companies at the commanding heights of the Russian economy , Gazprom and Rosneft . the Kissinger Associates lobbying group , whose Russian section is headed by Graham , feeds in to the Kissinger-Primakov working group , a quasi-private-sector effort , blessed by Putin , to deepen ties between Russia and the United States .
it is highly instructive to read the recommendations of these people and groups , as they unobtrusively render the objectives of their Kremlin clients into a language familiar to American leaders .
Graham ’ s latest contribution , “ Resurgent Russia and US Purposes , ” is most revealing in this respect . the author finds the government of a “ Russia getting up off its knees ” to consist of progressive modernizers fully aware of the challenges facing their country as it attempts to “ return to the great powers club . ”
“ In order to become a genuinely developed and modern country , ” Graham continues , “ in the coming decade Russia will need to invest at least one trillion dollars in modernizing its infrastructure . America and the West in general have a vital interest in seeing the modernization of Russia succeed .
unless that sort of appeasement is pursued , he warns , Russia will continue to oppose the US “ wherever and whenever it can . ” According to Graham , “ At the extreme , a weak Russia , with its vast resources and sparse population east of the Urals , could become the object of competition among the great powers , notably China and the United States . ”
that unspoken help-us-develop-or-we ’ ll-let-the-Chinese-do-it threat is a logical development of Prime Minister Putin ’ s homily at this year ’ s World Economic Forum in Davos , where he advocated decisive action to end the world economic crisis . his recipe ?
but no amount of money will succeed in modernizing Putin &apos;s kleptocratic regime , which has already squandered trillions in oil wealth . simply put , the Putin system is politically , institutionally , and intellectually antithetical to the task of modernization .
this is not his area of specialization . Kissinger works personally with the Chinese account , jointly propounding with his long-time rival Zbigniew Brzezinski the notion , so seductive for an America growing weary of its imperial burden , of a global Big Two .
here is a recent sample of Kissinger ’ s geopolitical arts : “ The role of China in a new world order is crucial . a relationship that started on both sides as essentially a strategic design to constrain a common adversary has evolved over the decades into a pillar of the international system ...
one wants to get his hooks into a further trillion dollars that it can pick away at , while the other wants to become “ a central construct of the system of international relations . ” But , in both cases , the customers are getting the influence for which they are paying .
who Wants Peace in the Middle East ?
forty years after the Six Day War peace between Israelis and Palestinians seems as distant as ever . Israel still refuses to accept the new Palestinian national unity government as a negotiating partner because Hamas is part of that government .
politically , Palestine ’ s Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh remains against recognizing Israel and respecting the existing agreements . he declared that he is for the continuation of resistance in all forms .
that is the question the European Union needs to ask itself as it debates whether to resume providing financial aid to the Palestinian Authority . the EU should make it clear to Hamas that the Union is not going to finance terror and is not going to finance a refusal to make peace .
if the current Palestinian leadership changes its position , there will be no problem from our side . we will have nothing against negotiations .
if such a right were recognized , there would be a Palestinian majority instead of a Jewish majority , which would mean the end of the Jewish state . this is a demographic , not a religious , question : an Arab state is where the Arabs are the majority , and the Jewish state is where the Jews are the majority .
but there are other problems in the region that Israel – and the world – must face . the Palestinians ’ current unity government resulted from Saudi mediation , which came in response mainly to Iran ’ s ambition to increase its influence , not only in Iraq , but also in Lebanon , Gaza , and the West Bank .
the ongoing fight in the Muslim world between Sunnis and Shi ’ a recalls the struggle between Protestants and Catholics in seventeenth-century Europe . so it is little wonder that the Saudis , Jordanians , Egyptians , and the Gulf states are seeking to resist Iran ’ s hegemonic ambitions in the region .
nevertheless , the stakes are far higher than in the seventeenth century , because Iran represents a threat that combines a fanatic religion with a determination to acquire nuclear weapons . indeed , Iran is the only country that openly declares its desire to destroy another member of the United Nations .
Israel never openly proclaimed that it would enrich uranium and build nuclear bombs in order to destroy another country . on the contrary , Israel has said that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the Middle East .
even now , Israel is planning to build a new “ corridor of peace , ” which will comprise the Jordanians , the Palestinians , and us . within the framework of this project , we are seeking to halt the dehydration of the Dead Sea , build a joint airport and a joint water network with Jordan , and develop tourism infrastructure , at a cost of up to $ 5 billion .
Israel wants – indeed , desperately needs – peace and stability in the Middle East , and we will continue to do everything in our power to achieve it . but we cannot reach that goal alone , much less negotiate with those whose idea of a stable and peaceful Middle East is one that has no place for Israel .
who Will Eclipse America ?
but it is also not very useful . in thinking , for example , about American predominance in the world today , it would be nice to know when it will decline , and whether the United States can do anything to postpone the inevitable .
contemporary commenters despaired of the Roman Empire for several hundred years before it finally collapsed . could America find its way to a similar extension ?
in terms of providing an essential structure for discussion of this problem , Arvind Subramanian ’ s new book , Eclipse : living in the Shadow of China ’ s Economic Dominance , is a major contribution . ( full disclosure : Subramanian and I are colleagues at the Peterson Institute for International Economics , and we have worked together on other issues . )
in particular , Subramanian develops an index of economic dominance that should become a focus of conversation anywhere that people want to think about changes in world economic leadership . there is no need to know any economics in order to be fascinated by this book : it is about power , pure and simple .
the United Kingdom was the world ’ s dominant economic power from the rise of industrialization in the early nineteenth century . but it lost its predominance and was gradually eclipsed by the US , which , at least since 1945 , has been the undisputed leader among market-based economies .
the US surpassed the UK in terms of industrial production as early as the end of the nineteenth century , but that was not enough to tip the balance . economic predominance shifted only when the UK ran large current-account deficits during World Wars I and II – the country had to borrow heavily in order to finance its war effort , and imports were significantly higher than exports .
this helped undermine the role of the British pound internationally and catapulted the US dollar to the fore – particularly after the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 , at which it was agreed that countries would hold their reserves in dollars as well as gold .
more recently , however , it has been the Americans ’ turn consistently to run large current-account deficits , buying more from the rest of the world than they earn by selling goods and services abroad . on this dimension , the US seems destined to repeat the mistake of the British .
in particular , China has followed a strategy in the past decade or so that entails running large current-account surpluses and building up foreign-exchange reserves , which are now reported to be in excess of $ 3 trillion . indeed , Subramanian ’ s most provocative argument is that China has already surpassed the US in terms of economic dominance – but we have not yet woken up to this new reality .
the story is fascinating and well told ; but there is still a great deal worth arguing . for example , did the British decline because the US could not be stopped , or because of problems within the British Empire and at home ?
now any such claims would seem preposterous . in both cases , the credit system got out of control , with too much lending to the private sector in 1980 ’ s Japan and excessive government borrowing during the 2000 ’ s in the eurozone .
similarly , it remains unclear that the Chinese development path will remain smooth . fixed investment in China is close to 50 % of GDP – which must be a world record .
on the key issue of being able to issue a “ reserve currency ” that investors and governments want to hold , Subramanian is correct that China has many of the prerequisites in place . but it still lacks some key elements , including fully-fledged property rights .
external challenges do sometimes bring down states . but , more frequently , the big problems are internal – the regime cannot deliver growth , its legitimacy fades , and people start to head for the exits ( or at least get their money out ) .
if the US is eclipsed any time soon , this will more likely be due to its loss of social cohesion and its dysfunctional politics . China might well step in to fill that vacuum , but that is quite different from being able to elbow America aside .
who Will Help the Poor ?
Paris – With the deepening of the economic crisis and the prospect of another recession looming large on the horizon , growing social inequality has become an increasingly urgent issue . how does one reinforce a sense of solidarity and responsibility within a country ?
as I ponder this issue , I am reminded of a debate that I had more than ten years ago in Berlin with the German theologian Hans Küng and American and Asian participants . the subject was “ Globalization and Ethics ” – specifically , a comparison of the ways that Europe , the United States and Asia protect the most fragile members of their respective societies .
all of the participants agreed that in Europe the state traditionally filled the role played by private philantropy in the US and by the family in Asia . but we all hastened to add that no model was “ pure , ” i.e. , the family was no longer what it used to be in Asia , the state was playing a bigger role than expected in America , and it was often underperforming in Europe .
reality has become even more complicated since then : the family ’ s role continues to decline in Asia ; philantropy , despite a few extraordinarily generous individuals , has more than met its limits in America ; and , with the possible exception of the Nordic countries , the state in Europe , overburdened by debt , no longer has the means or the will to shoulder new responsibilities .
so who will take on the responsibility to protect the weakest if none of these three actors can do it properly ? are we heading toward a world united by shared incompetence and inadequacy ?
in the Western world , the poorest are the worst affected by economic stagnation . but , in rapidly growing emerging-market countries , the rich tend to close their eyes to the suffering of the poorest , except when they feel threatened by the risk of political upheaval , as in , say , Saudi Arabia .
in fact , wealthy elites in emerging countries live in a state of denial towards their poor , literally ignoring them . Brazil and India are particularly striking in this regard .
it would be absurd to condemn , as some do , globalization as the main and only culprit in the erosion of traditional sources of support for the poor . globalization is above all a context , an environment , even if the consequences of the first major financial and economic crisis of the global age will further deepen the gap between the very rich and the very poor .
but globalization makes the weakest among us more visible , and therefore makes the absence of social justice more unacceptable . a world of much greater transparency and interdependency creates new responsibilities for the rich .
one could follow , for example , Adam Smith ’ s principle of comparative advantage : what Europe does best is the state , while Asia still relies on the family and the US continues to focus on individual initiative . the problem is that in a world of universal benchmarking , the legitimacy of solutions will stem more than ever from their cultural acceptability and their efficiency .
in Western Europe , for example , the call for sacrifice from all citizens in order to resolve the debt crisis runs up against a lingering perception that not all will contribute equally , and that social inequality will be exacerbated by austerity . restoring growth in the short term while addressing debt problems in the medium and long term may well be the only valid response to the crisis .
but , when it comes to the protection of the weakest and the struggle against rising social injustice , perhaps “ global deculturation ” creates an opportunity to combine the best of what remains in particular traditions . perhaps countries should seek to base their social-welfare systems on a new synthesis of the state , the family , and philanthropy .
who Will Rescue the Rest of Us ?
Sydney – The rescue of the 33 Chilean miners , from what was feared would be their tomb , gave the world something to cheer about . hope has not , after all , become a redundant virtue in the twenty-first century .
China , meanwhile , with foreign reserves worth half its total output , denies with a straight face that it is deliberately manipulating the value of the renminbi . so its trade surplus continues to soar at the expense of other countries .
nor does a global solution to the challenge of climate change appear any closer . a few weeks of rain in Australia has emboldened those who think that global warming is a gigantic hoax perpetrated by the United Nations or conspiring scientists or maybe men from Mars .
the war in Afghanistan bleeds more lives and treasure into the inhospitable terrain of that sad land , with little immediate chance of whatever might constitute sufficient success to allow America and its allies to quit . and the problems of Pakistan fester next door .
in Palestine , Israeli colonies continue to grow with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ignoring Washington ’ s efforts to secure traction for the peace process . Europeans continue to look inward , obsessed with their own problems of declining competitiveness and how to pay for entitlements that they have come to regard as theirs by right .
with the gap between the world ’ s rich and poor increasing , the impoverished South seeks a home or a job in the developed North . legal and illegal migration triggers far-right hostility in countries that customarily brag about their commitment to civil liberties .
so , as Lenin once asked , what is to be done ?
we need the sort of courage that was the hallmark of Margaret Thatcher . we need Bill Clinton ’ s extraordinary ability to spin a political narrative that enabled voters to identify their own interests with his goals .
we require Helmut Kohl ’ s understanding of the need to identify the big decisions in politics , and to get those decisions right . we need leaders with sufficient mastery of detail , like China ’ s last premier Zhu Rongji , who can not only tell us how they will get us from A to Z , but can actually lead us from A to B .
looking around , leaders like this seem to be an extinct species . or , if they exist at all , they appear to be constrained by dysfunctional political systems .
the best example is US President Barack Obama , on whom so many hopes rested – probably too many for any one leader . Obama inherited messy and expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , and an economy in meltdown .
now Obama faces defeat in the mid-term elections at the hands of Republicans whose past policies created many of the problems that weigh him down today . they want less government , lower taxes , and a smaller deficit , a combination to be achieved seemingly without pain .
the rest of the world needs a strong , self-confident , and decisive America . but America ’ s political system is about to deliver a balance of power in Washington that is likely to produce stalemate and paralysis .
in Europe , meanwhile , many of our problems are exemplified by what is happening in France , where President Nicolas Sarkozy ’ s attempt to recognize demographic and fiscal reality by raising the retirement age from 60 to 62 provoked a wave of strikes and stormy protests from workers and students . is there not something deeply depressing about 18-year-olds demonstrating about the retirement age ?
perhaps , then , Asia is the answer . perhaps the Singapore-based strategist Kishore Mahbubani is correct to write off the West and tell us that the future lies in his own continent .
India is a glorious democracy with an economically literate government and pockets of real economic achievement . but the fiasco in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games showcased some of India ’ s problems , not least deep corruption and inadequate infrastructure .
in Brussels the other day , Premier Wen Jiabao scolded European leaders for pressing for the renminbi ’ s revaluation . did they not understand , he argued , that this would lead to factory closures and social turbulence in China ?
it is more than odd to argue that the rest of the world has to cope with a built-in advantage for China ’ s exporters because its authoritarian political system cannot cope with any change . no wonder the impressive premier is thought to favor some political loosening .
the Chilean miners survived against the odds , so perhaps the rest of us will somehow get by as well . but who , exactly , is responsible for the rescue operation ?
who Will Run the World ?
Singapore – Barack Obama ’ s election comes at a moment when a new bit of conventional wisdom is congealing . it concerns the end of America ’ s global dominance .
true , freewheeling American-style capitalism has not acquitted itself proudly of late . and America ’ s military superiority has not proved all that useful in accomplishing American ends .
Europe is self-absorbed , focused on creating whatever kind of entity it ends up deciding to be . China ’ s standard response to any suggestion that it exercise global leadership is to hide beneath its vast internal agenda and plead poverty .
in the face of the familiar litany of desperate global problems – not just financial instability , but also climate change , energy insecurity , potential pandemics , terrorism , and the spread of weapons of mass destruction – the prospect of a rudderless world is more than alarming . what is to be done ?
given that the United States has not been playing much of a leadership role on many of these issues recently , it is worth taking a look at what happens when no one country exercises effective leadership . one set of answers might seem apparent from the collapse of international trade negotiations and the unraveling international system to control the spread of nuclear weapons .
it is now clear that avoiding catastrophic climate change requires dramatic and rapid reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions , cuts that would lower annual emissions to 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 . yet emissions are not just rising , but accelerating .
supposedly , by December 2009 they will agree on a new treaty to set limits on emissions . but the prospects that an agreement will be reached in Copenhagen in December 2009 are close to nil .
the new Obama administration will have only a few months to develop meaningful proposals that can win domestic support , and will be preoccupied with the aftermath of the current financial debacle and the Iraq war . Europe is pushing for ambitious targets but is having trouble with its own vested interests .
an inter-governmental system that falls apart under the challenges of trade negotiations and proliferation threats is unlikely to master the deep complexity and multitudinous vested interests that the issue of climate change entails . traditional diplomacy will at best devise a face-saving but meaningless accord next year .
in many areas , frustration with inter-governmental intransigence and incompetence has sparked extraordinary innovation by non-governmental organizations , corporations , and ordinary people . private organizations such as the Forest Stewardship Council and the Marine Stewardship Council provide and , increasingly , implement environmental standards where inter-governmental action has failed .
agreements about how to make things better already frequently include NGOs and corporations in various capacities – and sometimes exclude governments altogether . private groups using everything from satellite imagery ( as in forestry ) to the unofficial equivalent of on-site inspections ( as in human rights ) monitor who is abiding by – or violating – what standard of behavior .
while enforcement in the coercive sense remains the domain of states , coercive enforcement is rare even when it comes to inter-governmental agreements . whether countries abide by agreements has far more to do with international processes of persuasion , socialization , and capacity-building – and those can be done by anyone with a good argument .
the big question today is whether all these alternative approaches can add up to more than a bit of desperate tinkering around the edges . standard international-relations thinking does not even entertain the question , and those conventional ways of seeing the world have blinded us to looking at this crucial question .
there are hundreds of global public-private partnerships working on various global ills – but few have been examined to see what good they do . the mishmash of initiatives , actors , campaigns , and appeals creates opportunities for major progress – and mass confusion .
if there is to be real progress toward more effective and efficient global governance that can address the unprecedented challenges posed by climate change and the rest of the global agenda , we must do much more than look for an easy replacement for American hegemony . we must figure out how to make sense of this enormous diversity of ways of saving the world .
citizen Bezos ?
new YORK – My very first serious job was as a fact-checker for Forbes magazine ( now mostly a laissez-faire collection of blogs ) . I consider fact-checkers to be the altar boys of journalism .
so , in most of the discussion about business models occasioned by the sale of the Washington Post to Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos , the values that I have held dear are being tarnished . how so ?
even reputable fact-checkers disagree on the origin of the famous admonition to journalists : “ Comfort the afflicted , and afflict the comfortable ! ” ( They even disagree on whether it was first directed at preachers or at newsmen ) .
these temptations have always been present , but “ hard ” news could be supported by constituency-pleasing sections , advertiser-pleasing features and product reviews , news-you-can-use sections replete with ads for related goods , and , of course , the classified ads .
today , the church of newspaper journalism is fragmenting . brands and advertisers can speak directly to customers , and markets no longer need the convening power of a newspaper to match buyers and sellers ( the purpose of classified ads ) .
investigative journalism and serious commentary , like religion , do not have a profit model . they serve a higher purpose ( although they can be and often are corrupted or twisted for bad ends ) .
he is a canny businessman – that much is clear . he runs Amazon tightly and for the long term ; it generates huge amounts of cash , which it reinvests on behalf of all of its shareholders .
but it is Bezos personally , not Amazon , who bought the Post . this is a man who is a generous donor to the Long Now Foundation ( I am on its board ) and who personally founded and owns a rocket company , Blue Origin ( I am on the board of a competing company called XCOR ) .
I think – I hope ! – that Bezos will make the proper distinctions . he understands the difference between media ( yet another of his personal investments is the Web site Business Insider ) and journalism .
but we are also discovering behavioral economics – the human quirks and emotional urges that drive people to do things that make little economic sense . the best joke of all – that Bezos bought the Post by mistake through an errant one-click purchase ( a capability patented by Amazon ) – has a ring of truth to it .
there probably is not a sustainable business model for newspapers like the Post . but I do think there is sustainable value of the kind that no corporation or financially driven investor could ever justify .
although Murdoch remains chairman of both , everyone expects him to focus more on the news business . that portfolio includes both customer-pleasing tabloids with a troubled history of pandering , spying , and bribing , and the venerable journalism of the Wall Street Journal ’ s news pages – a contradiction that splitting the parent has not resolved .
and , finally , there is Project Syndicate itself ( which publishes this column ) . originally funded by yet another billionaire , George Soros , Project Syndicate operates independently to provide hard-to-monetize informed opinion and analysis with nary an “ advertorial ” or product review in sight .
a tony à la carte sanctuary with great wines that generate most of the profit ? a franchise with pre-cooked dishes thawed and heated in huge ovens ?
but there is also the philanthropic soup kitchen – in the Post ’ s case , a high-end one , delivering nutritious food in a world in which restaurants now give away less-healthy food , because they use it to sell other goods .
in the end , I think Bezos wants less to own the Post than to set it free , for at least a generation or two . as Bezos wrote in a memo to the staff : “ The values of the Post do not need changing .
why America Must Not Re-elect President Bush
I have never been heavily involved in partisan politics , but these are not normal times . President George W. Bush is endangering the United States and the world &apos;s safety while undermining American values .
if re-elected , the Bush doctrine of preemptive action - and the invasion of Iraq - will be endorsed , and the world will have to live with the consequences . by repudiating Bush &apos;s policies at the polls , America will have a chance to regain the respect and support of the world .
the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , required a strong response . but they also led to suspension of the critical process so essential to a democracy - a full and fair discussion of the issues .
in fact , Bush played right into the hands of Osama bin Laden . Afghanistan &apos;s invasion was justified : that was where bin Laden lived and al Qaeda had its training camps .
it has given way to widespread resentment . there are many more people willing to risk their lives to kill Americans than there were on September 11 .
Bush likes to insist that terrorists hate Americans for what they are - a freedom loving people - not what they do . but war and occupation create innocent victims .
it was part of a system of dealing with prisoners put in place by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld . public opinion condemns America worldwide , and our troops in Iraq are paying the price .
at a time of peril , people rally around the flag , and Bush exploited this by fostering a sense of danger . his campaign assumes that people do not really care about the truth and will believe almost anything if it is repeated often enough .
for instance , some 40 % of Americans still believe that Saddam Hussein was connected with 9 / 11 , although the 9 / 11 Commission - set up by Bush and chaired by a Republican - definitively established that no such connection existed . I want to shout : &quot; wake up America .
weapons of mass destruction could not be found , and the connection with al Qaeda could not be established . Bush then claimed that America went to war to liberate Iraq .
but America had an obligation to maintain law and order ; instead , we stood idly by while Baghdad and other cities were ransacked . if we had cared about the Iraqi people , we should have had more troops available for the occupation .
worse still , when American soldiers encountered resistance , they employed methods - invading homes and mistreating prisoners - that alienated and humiliated the population , generating resentment and rage .
when the insurgency became intractable , America installed an Iraqi government . the man chosen to lead it was a protégé of the CIA with a reputation for being a strongman - a far cry from democracy .
despite the Bush campaign &apos;s efforts at spin control , the situation in Iraq is dire . much of the western part of the country has been ceded to insurgents , the prospect of holding free and fair elections in January is fast receding , civil war looms .
Bush &apos;s war in Iraq has done untold damage to America as well , impairing its military power and undermining the morale of the armed forces . before the war , America could project overwhelming force .
the Bush administration can be criticized for many other policies , but none are as important as Iraq . the war has cost nearly $ 200 billion , and costs will continue to mount , because getting into Iraq was much easier than getting out will be .
he suppressed the critical process , arguing that any criticism of the Commander-in-Chief puts US troops at risk . but this is Bush &apos;s war , and he ought to be held responsible for it .
a moment &apos;s reflection should raise another question : does Bush &apos;s Texas swagger qualify him to remain America &apos;s Commander-in-Chief ?
calling Off America ’ s Bombs
new YORK – As the US Congress considers whether to authorize American military intervention in Syria , its members should bear in mind a basic truth : while Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad has repeatedly used extreme violence to retain power , the United States – and other governments in the Middle East and Europe – share responsibility for turning Syria into a killing field .
without their involvement , Assad ’ s regime would most likely have remained repressive ; with their involvement , Syria has become a site of mass death and destruction . more than 100,000 people have died , and many of the world ’ s cultural and archaeological treasures have been demolished .
when the Arab Spring erupted in Tunisia and Egypt in January 2011 , protests erupted in Syria as well . in addition to the usual grievances under a brutal regime , Syrians were reeling from a massive drought and soaring food prices .
the protests became a military rebellion when parts of the Syrian army broke with the regime and established the Free Syrian Army . neighboring Turkey was probably the first outside country to support the rebellion on the ground , giving sanctuary to rebel forces along its border with Syria .
the second phase began when the US helped to organize a large group of countries to back the rebellion . at a meeting of foreign ministers in Istanbul on April 1 , 2012 , the US and other countries pledged active financial and logistical support for the Free Syrian Army .
that open-ended statement , without any clear means to achieve the goal that it announced , has done much to fuel military escalation and the rising death toll in Syria , while pushing the US repeatedly to defend its “ credibility ” against a line in the sand that it should not have drawn .
the US views Syria mainly through the lens of Iran , seeking to depose Assad in order to deprive Iran ’ s leaders of an important ally in the region , one that borders Israel . the US-led effort in Syria is thus best understood as a proxy war with Iran – a cynical strategy that has contributed to the massive rise in violence .
the US government ’ s misguided move from potential mediator and problem solver to active backer of the Syrian insurrection was , predictably , a terrible mistake . it put the US in effective opposition to the United Nations peace initiative then being led by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan , whose approach was to call for a ceasefire followed by a negotiated political transition .
even if the US ultimately sought to force Assad from office , its blunt action hardened Assad ’ s resistance , as well as that of his two allies in the UN Security Council , Russia and China . aside from seeking to defend their own interests in the region , both countries understandably rejected the idea of US-led regime change in Syria .
indeed , Russia was playing a plausibly constructive role at the time , albeit one premised on Assad remaining in power for at least a transitional period , if not indefinitely . Russia sought a pragmatic approach that would protect its commercial interests in Syria and its naval base at the port of Tartus , while bringing an end to the bloodletting .
now , with the use of chemical weapons , probably by the Syrian government ( and possibly by both sides ) , the US has again ratcheted up the stakes . bypassing the UN once again , the US is declaring its intention to intervene directly by bombing Syria , ostensibly to deter the future use of chemical weapons .
on the contrary , many of them are ostensibly America ’ s close allies . so why does the US continue to back a deadly rebellion in a civil war that is continuing to escalate dangerously , now to the point of chemical-weapons attacks ?
the overriding idea is that the US and its close allies get to choose who governs in the region . Assad must go not because he is authoritarian , but because he is allied with Iran , which , from the perspective of the US , Israel , Turkey , and several Gulf countries , makes him a regional threat .
in fact , the US has probably been lured into serving these countries ’ own narrower interests , whether it be Israel ’ s unconvincing vision of its own security or the Sunni countries ’ opposition to Shia Iran . but , in the long term , US foreign policy divorced from international law cannot produce anything other than more war .
the US should reverse course . a direct US attack on Syria without UN backing is far more likely to inflame the region than it is to resolve the crisis there – a point well appreciated in the United Kingdom , where Parliament bucked the government by rejecting British participation in a military strike .
instead , the US should provide evidence of the chemical attacks to the UN ; call on the Security Council to condemn the perpetrators ; and refer such violations to the International Criminal Court . moreover , the Obama administration should try to work with Russia and China to enforce the Chemical Weapons Convention .
more broadly , the US should stop using countries like Syria as proxies against Iran . withdrawal of US financial and logistical support for the rebellion , and calling on others to do the same , would not address Syria ’ s authoritarianism or resolve America ’ s issues with Iran , but it would stop or greatly reduce the large-scale killing and destruction in Syria itself .
it would also enable the UN peace process to resume , this time with the US and Russia working together to restrain violence , keep Al Qaeda at bay ( a shared interest ) , and find a longer-term pragmatic solution to Syria ’ s deep domestic divisions . and the search for a US modus vivendi with Iran – where a new president suggests a change of course on foreign policy – could be revived .
it is time for the US to help stop the killing in Syria . that means abandoning the fantasy that it can or should determine who rules in the Middle East .
diplomacy and Double Standards
Canberra – When does acceptable diplomatic caution and realism become indefensible abdication of moral standards ? not everyone on the foreign-policy frontline cares , but those who do often face deeply uncomfortable choices .
calming a volatile situation may mean not publicly denouncing behavior that cries out for condemnation . making the right call is more difficult in the real world than in a philosophy classroom .
but sometimes the line really is crossed , all relevant players know it , and the consequences are potentially profound . the United States ’ failure so far to cut off its military aid to Egypt in response to the regime ’ s massacre of hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters , in the streets and in prisons , is as clear a recent case as one can find .
if the Muslim Brotherhood denied a ballot , or refused to accept defeat , tougher measures could then have been contemplated . as it is , the army ’ s coup was indefensible , and its slaughter of mostly unarmed protesters ranks in infamy with the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 , and those of Libya ’ s former leader , Muammar el-Qaddafi , and Syria ’ s Hafez and Bashar al-Assad .
farther afield , the US risks reinforcing the perception that it is comfortable with double standards . for a country whose global leadership depends as much on its soft power as on its military might , that is dynamite .
the charge sheet here is already rather full , with multiple instances in recent years of America being almost universally regarded as not practicing what it preaches . for starters , there was the invasion of Iraq in 2003 : embracing the United Nations Security Council when you get your way , but bypassing it when you don ’ t , does not do much to encourage a cooperative rule-based international order .
then there was the Palestinian election of 2006 : promoting democracy generates ridicule when it extends only to elections that produce palatable winners , as Gaza ’ s vote for Hamas did not . or , again in the Middle East , there has been the blind eye endlessly turned to Israel ’ s actual possession of nuclear weapons , in contrast to the response to Iran ’ s possible early moves in that direction .
to be fair to the US , such double standards abound among other major powers as well . Russia ’ s invocation of the “ responsibility to protect ” to justify its 2008 invasion of Georgia was met with incredulity at the time , and rendered even more cynical by its resolute failure since 2011 to condemn the Syrian regime for mass-atrocity crimes against its own people .
China ’ s strategic aspirations in the South China Sea , and its unwillingness to embrace a maritime code of conduct there , sit uncomfortably with its stated concern for sovereign boundaries and the peaceful resolution of territorial disputes . and every one of the nuclear-armed states has been guilty of “ do as I say , not as I do ” in insisting on non-proliferation while making no serious commitment to disarmament .
to be fair to diplomatic policymakers everywhere , it is often the case that hard choices between competing moral values – for example , justice and peace – simply have to be made . and positions that are claimed to embody double standards are often nothing of the kind .
but this ignores the principle that no military intervention will ever be legitimate unless it satisfies , among other criteria , the test of diminishing , not augmenting , human suffering . &amp; # 160 ; And going to war against any of the major powers to protect a suffering minority would certainly trigger a much wider conflagration .
the bottom line is that values matter in international relations , and states that place great emphasis on the promotion of values are extremely vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy . no state that aspires to win the support or cooperation of others can afford to be seen to be comfortable with unambiguous double standards .
why America Will Lead the “ Asian Century ”
Singapore – Not a week passes , it seems , without a big-picture thinker releasing a big-picture book or giving a big-picture sermon describing the gradual eclipse of American hegemony in Asia . true , American power will inevitably decline in relative terms as Asian giants such as China and India rise .
the nature of US power and the exercise of its influence was always much more clever and subtle than most assume . in fact , as India and China rise , the US could actually find itself in a stronger position .
in contrast , it takes about two decades for the US economy to double in size . doesn ’ t this surely mean that Asia is rushing toward a state of multi-polarity – a configuration of roughly equal great powers balancing against each other – while American influence is on the wane ?
the seemingly obvious conclusion would be true but for the fact that Asia has a unique kind of hierarchical security system that came about partly by accident and partly by design .
yet , despite the fact that America spends more on defense than the next ten powers combined , it has never been a regional hegemon because it actually relies on the cooperation of other states to remain predominant . without cooperation from allies such as Japan , South Korea , Singapore , and the Philippines , the US could not retain its forward military positions in the West Pacific .
thus , there is broad-based regional approval of US alliances with Japan , South Korea , and Australia , as well as with partners such as the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand , and India . the key to the effectiveness of these bilateral relationships is that they enjoy widespread support ( and thus legitimacy ) in the region as stabilizing arrangements .
combined with the raw military capacity that the US brings to the table , this means that America is powerful enough to enforce the peace and provide stability for commerce to thrive . America ’ s presence and bilateral partnerships are complementary to Asian states ’ obsession with counter-dominance and non-interference in the region .
this dynamic “ liberal order ” – largely fair , flexible , and open enough to welcome new entrants as they rise – will continue to serve Asia well . for example , even China has been a major beneficiary of the public goods provided by the US-led hierarchical system .
this interdependent relationship means that the US is not so powerful , that it can readily ignore the wishes of key states , and it is here that its apparent weakness is actually strength . America is not a Hobbesian Leviathan with absolute authority and power .
in fact , any balancing tends to take place in order to preserve the hierarchy , not to replace or supersede it . other states tend to resist bids by any Asian power – be it Japan , China or India – to rise to the top of the pyramid .
as China and India rise , and Japan becomes more “ normal , ” they will balance each other within the US-led hierarchy to ensure that the US remains on top and one or the other doesn ’ t dominate . if China makes a bid for regional hegemony , it will find it difficult to resist the structural constraints placed on it within this hierarchy .
false triumphalism breeds poor discipline . but a sense of strategic vulnerability breeds interdependency , which has always been the key to successful US leadership in Asia .
China without North Korea
the official Chinese reaction to North Korea ’ s latest provocation was stern : China is “ strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed ” to the test , and it is calling for the resumption of international talks . but China ’ s stance lacks meaningful bite , because its leaders fail to recognize that they no longer need to succumb to their unruly neighbor ’ s blackmail .
the international community is again firmly focused on China ’ s relationship with its rogue ally , and expects that , as an emerging superpower seeking to reassure the world of its peaceful rise , China will play a constructive role . however limited China ’ s influence may be , the North Korean regime can sustain itself only with Chinese backing .
with North Korea ’ s latest nuclear test coming so quickly after its rocket launch in December , the United Nations has good reason to ask China , a permanent Security Council member , to take the diplomatic lead . it is simply not enough for China to call , as its official statement does , for the resumption of the Six-Party Talks with South Korea , China , the US , Japan , and Russia .
China must warn North Korea that it will not be pressured into providing support even when Chinese national interests have been undermined . indeed , China should make clear that , much as it would prefer North Korea to survive and prosper , it could afford to allow its erstwhile ally to implode .
simply put , the conventional wisdom that North Korea ’ s collapse would be disastrous for China is misconceived . &amp; # 160 ; Any crisis sparked by North Korean refugees fleeing across the Chinese border would be short-lived , and international assistance would be readily available .
unification would occupy the Korean people for the next two decades , with Japan and the US compelled to inject a huge amount of aid to rebuild and reintegrate the North . this hardly runs counter to China ’ s interests as it continues its own advance toward becoming the world ’ s largest economy .
indeed , if this process were to unfold , the US rationale for keeping its own military forces in South Korea would disappear . a phased reduction of the American presence would follow . &amp; # 160 ; If the US wished to maintain bases in Korea in the longer term , it would have to secure permission from a proud and newly united Korean nation – hardly a forgone conclusion .
the US will remain committed to de-nuclearizing the peninsula , while the Korean government will be tempted to retain the North ’ s nuclear capabilities . this strain further reduces the risk of having US troops stationed on the Korean side of China ’ s border .
Chinese President Xi Jinping ’ s top foreign-policy priority is to force the Japanese government to acknowledge , if not accept , China ’ s territorial claims in the two countries ’ dispute over the Diaoyu / Senkaku islands in the East China Sea . Chinese naval ships have already trained their weapons on a Japanese destroyer and a Japanese naval helicopter .
under current law , Japanese security forces are forbidden from firing their weapons unless clearly fired upon , which means that the country ’ s Maritime Self-Defense Force vessels can do little when targeted by Chinese naval radar . and revising the rules to allow Japan ’ s military to , say , destroy a North Korean missile before it reaches Japanese air space would increase the risk of conflict between Chinese and Japanese naval and air forces .
if the Chinese leadership can think beyond its usual default response to North Korean misbehavior – abstract condemnation followed by a call for dialogue – it can apply real pressure on the North Korean regime in full view of the international community . North Korea ’ s last ally should give it one last chance .
Apple ’ s Cash-Flow Problem
large firms face an increasingly fluid economic , technological , and political environment – owing to more global and competitive markets , to the greater potential of technological change to alter firms ’ business environment , and to governments ’ growing influence over what makes business sense . in this fluid environment , large companies must be cautious before making large , long-term commitments .
second , I described how emerging data could suggest measurement problems with the conventional wisdom that more rapid trading in financial markets is making them more oriented to the short term than ever before . proponents of this view point to furious trading in New York and London , with average holding periods for major stocks diminishing in recent decades .
its products , from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks , have captured consumers ’ imaginations , remade markets , and earned the company and its shareholders huge sums of money . Apple ’ s stock capitalization has soared , and it became the first trillion-dollar company .
as Apple ’ s profits have grown , it has amassed $ 137 billion in cash , according to a recent count – more than it can profitably use ( at least for now ) in its operations . so the company has wisely left its cash invested in global financial accounts , not business operations .
enter shareholder activist David Einhorn , whose hedge fund Greenlight Capital has been pressing Apple to distribute a healthy fraction of that cash . much commentary on the foray has been negative : Einhorn ’ s proposal is a short-run , financial-engineering idea for a company that has gone from success to success , it is said – American stock-market short-termism at its worst .
maybe investors are being too quick to pressure a great company . but , odd as it might seem , getting its cash out could be a good long-term strategy for Apple .
there has long been a life cycle for firms : young firms innovate , are cash-hungry , and have to scramble for financing . some succeed , sell their products , and find themselves pulling in more cash than they need .
new , hotter technologies come along , and the firm no longer attracts the best people to work for it , because , well , it ’ s no longer the next new thing . new products stall , old products are not as profitable as they once were ( because competitors figure out how to make something better ) , and markets and consumers move on .
firms that reach that point , and that know themselves , then return more of their cash hoard to their investors , who invest it elsewhere . in the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , large swaths of American industry – especially the domestic oil industry – faced this problem , described by the economist Michael Jensen as the managerial challenge of handling free cash flow well .
is it middle-aged , but nimble and able to remake itself , as it did several times during Steve Jobs ’ tenure ? does it need $ 137 billion to engineer and finance a large-scale Apple TV that will be even more successful than iPhones and iPads ?
could the rollout last fall of the inferior Apple Maps , which sent people to the wrong destination – causing severe public embarrassment and leading to a managerial shakeup – foreshadow a time when Apple ’ s best days are behind it ? the company could be at a high plateau and could stay there for years , even decades , but does it really need $ 137 billion in cash for new investments ?
were those products ’ success the result of a unique Apple asset , namely Steve Jobs , or is the company well positioned to produce the next big thing ? could it be too tempting in the short run to Apple ’ s management to have that $ 137 billion in the bank , so that it spends some or all of it on investments that fail to pan out in the long run ?
it is at least possible – maybe even likely – that Apple ’ s best long-term move would be to release a hefty portion of its unused cash to its shareholders , who would then plow it back into the economy . meanwhile , it can finance its next new thing from the cash that its great products will continue to generate .
why Are Good Policies Bad Politics ?
every extra percentage point of unemployment lasting for two years costs $ 400 billion . a recession twice as deep as the one we have had would have cost the US roughly $ 2 trillion – and cost the world as a whole four times as much .
and any attempt to make investment bankers suffer more last fall and winter would have put the entire support operation at risk . as Fed Vice Chairman Don Kohn said , ensuring that a few thousand investment bankers receive their just financial punishment is a non-starter when attempts to do so put the jobs of millions of Americans – and tens of millions outside the US – at risk .
the Obama administration ’ s fiscal stimulus has also significantly helped the economy . though the jury is still out on the effect of the tax cuts in the stimulus , aid to states has been a job-saving success , and the flow of government spending on a whole variety of relatively useful projects is set to boost production and employment in the same way that consumer spending boosts production and employment .
and the cost of carrying the extra debt incurred is extraordinarily low : $ 12 billion a year of extra taxes would be enough to finance the fiscal-stimulus program at current interest rates . for that price , American taxpayers will get an extra $ 1 trillion of goods and services , and employment will be higher by about ten million job-years .
the valid complaints about fiscal policy over the past 14 months are not that it has run up the national debt and rewarded the princes of Wall Street , but rather that it has been too limited – that we ought to have done more . yet these policies are political losers now : nobody is proposing more stimulus .
this is strange , because usually when something works the natural impulse is to do it again . good policies that are boosting production and employment without causing inflation ought to be politically popular , right ?
with respect to Obama ’ s stimulus package , it seems to me that there has been extraordinary intellectual and political dishonesty on the American right , which the press refuses to see .
sometimes spending rises because there is more disposable cash in the economy , and sometimes because changes in opportunity costs – the cost of forgoing some other action , such as saving – make people want to spend the cash they have more rapidly . sometimes and to some degree these increases show up as increases in prices , and sometimes and to some degree as increases in production and employment .
Obama ’ s Republican opponents , who claim that fiscal stimulus cannot work , rely on arguments that are incoherent at best , and usually simply wrong , if not mendacious . remember that back in 1993 , when the Clinton administration ’ s analyses led it to seek to spend less and reduce the deficit , the Republicans said that that would destroy the economy , too .
such claims were as wrong then as they are now . but how many media reports make even a cursory effort to evaluate them ?
a stronger argument , though not by much , is that the fiscal stimulus is boosting employment and production , but at too great a long-run cost because it has produced too large a boost in America &apos;s national debt . if interest rates on US Treasury securities were high and rising rapidly as the debt grew , I would agree with this argument .
those who claim that America has a debt problem , and that a debt problem cannot be cured with more debt , ignore ( sometimes deliberately ) that private debt and US Treasury debt have been very different animals – moving in different directions and behaving in different ways – since the start of the financial crisis .
what the market is saying is not that the economy has too much debt , but that it has too much private debt , which is why prices of corporate bonds are low and firms find financing expensive . the market is also saying – clearly and repeatedly – that the economy has too little public US government debt , which is why everyone wants to hold it .
the Long Mystery of Low Interest Rates
Cambridge – As policymakers and investors continue to fret over the risks posed by today ’ s ultra-low global interest rates , academic economists continue to debate the underlying causes . &amp; # 160 ; By now , everyone accepts some version of US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke ’ s statement in 2005 that a “ global savings glut ” is at the root of the problem .
he pointed to how the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990 ’ s caused the region ’ s voracious investment demand to collapse , while simultaneously inducing Asian governments to stockpile liquid assets as a hedge against another crisis . Bernanke also pointed to increased retirement saving by aging populations in Germany and Japan , as well as to saving by oil-exporting countries , with their rapidly growing populations and concerns about oil revenues in the long term .
like most economists , he believes that if policymakers try to keep interest rates at artificially low levels for too long , eventually demand will soar and inflation will jump . so , if inflation is low and stable , central banks cannot be blamed for low long-term rates .
in fact , I strongly suspect that if one polled investors , monetary policy would be at the top of the list , not absent from it , as an explanation of low global long-term interest rates . the fact that so many investors hold this view ought to make one think twice before absolving monetary policy of all responsibility .
we had the financial crisis , and some of the factors cited by Bernanke have substantially reversed . for example , Asian investment is booming again , led by China .
one view holds that long-term growth risks have been on the rise , raising the premium on assets that are perceived to be relatively safe , and raising precautionary saving in general . ( of course , no one should think that any government bonds are completely safe , particularly from inflation and financial repression . )
because emerging economies have relatively weak asset markets , their citizens seek safe haven in advanced-country government bonds . a related theory is that emerging economies ’ citizens find it difficult to diversify the huge risk inherent in their fast-growing but volatile environments , and feel particularly vulnerable as a result of weak social safety nets .
these explanations have some merit , but one should recognize that central banks and sovereign wealth funds , not private citizens , are the players most directly responsible for the big savings surpluses . it is a strain to think that governments have the same motivations as private citizens .
besides , on closer inspection , the emerging-market explanation , though convenient , is not quite as compelling as it might seem . emerging economies are growing much faster than the advanced countries , which neoclassical growth models suggest should push global interest rates up , not down .
similarly , the integration of emerging-market countries into the global economy has brought with it a flood of labor . according to standard trade theory , a global labor glut ought to imply an increased rate of return on capital , which again pushes interest rates up , not down .
surely , any explanation must include the global constriction of credit , especially for small and medium-size businesses . tighter regulation of lending standards has shut out an important source of global investment demand , putting downward pressure on interest rates .
my best guess is that when global uncertainty fades and global growth picks up , global interest rates will start to rise , too . but predicting the timing of this transition is difficult .
why Are Savings Patterns So Different ?
yet , by 2007 , China ’ s household savings rate had risen to a staggering 30 % , compared to just 2.5 % in the US . the pattern is not uncharacteristic of other industrialized countries relative to emerging markets over the last two decades ( Figure 1 ) .
savings behavior invariably reacts to changes in interest rates , which have fallen steadily over the last two decades to today ’ s record-low levels . but how can savings patterns be so different – often opposite – in globalized economies that are well integrated into world capital markets ?
the answer may be that credit markets are more developed in advanced economies than they are in emerging countries , particularly in terms of the degree to which households are able to borrow . of course , one might argue that Asian thrift and American profligacy merely reflect asymmetric demands for credit : Asians are intrinsically more reluctant to borrow .
a more plausible explanation is that institutional differences in the ability to borrow dictate to some extent the disparity in savings rates across countries . the argument is simple : all economies have both borrowers and savers , and changes in the cost of borrowing ( or the return to saving ) affect them differently .
however , in a country with a large mass of effective savers , the savings rate can rise , rather than fall . this asymmetry in savings patterns might thus reflect the simple fact that credit-constrained economies are less sensitive to drops in the cost of borrowing relative to less constrained economies .
the young normally face low , current wage income , but faster growth in future income , and would ideally borrow against future income to augment consumption today and to invest in education . the middle-aged , preparing for retirement , are likely to be the economy ’ s savers .
in fact , there was a remarkable contrast in savings behavior across age groups in China and the US in the period 1992-2009 . for young Americans ( those under 25 ) , the borrowing rate rose by ten percentage pointsmore than the borrowing rate of young Chinese , while the savings rate of the Chinese working-age population ( ages 35-54 ) rose by about 17 percentage points more than the savings rate of their American counterparts .
another implication of this view is that the steep rise in savings in China is largely driven by a rise in the savings rate of middle-aged Chinese ( rather than a fall in the borrowing rate of the young ) . conversely , the fall in savings in the US is largely due to higher borrowing by the young ( rather than a fall in middle-aged Americans ’ savings rate ) .
apart from accounting for the global divergence in savings rates , tight credit constraints in China might explain the country ’ s high , and rising , savings rate – especially as the large rise in national savings is attributable mostly to household savings . this would mean that China ’ s much-publicized effort to boost domestic consumption might in fact call for appropriate credit-market reforms .
US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke ’ s notion of a “ global savings glut ” is a commonly cited explanation for falling world interest rates . credit constraints in fast-growing developing economies may be the reason why the glut emerged in the first place .
Europe ’ s Path to Disunity
it is difficult to express the differences between the US and the European model any more clearly than this . the US is a melting pot , whereas Europe is a mosaic of different peoples and cultures that has developed over the course of its long history .
that difference raises the question of whether it is worth striving for a United States of Europe – a concept that many refuse to accept , because they do not believe in the possibility of a unified European identity . a single political system like that of the US , they insist , presupposes a common language and a single nationality .
after all , deeper European integration and the creation of a single political system offer solid , practical advantages that do not require a common identity or language . these advantages include the right to move freely across borders , the free movement of goods and services , legal certainty for cross-border economic activities , Europe-wide transportation infrastructure , and , not least , common security arrangements .
if banks are regulated at the national level , but do business internationally , national regulatory authorities have a permanent incentive to set lax standards to avoid driving business to other countries and to lure it from them instead . regulatory competition thus degenerates into a race to the bottom , since the benefits of lax regulation translate into profits at home , while the losses lie with bank creditors around the world .
there are many similar examples from the fields of standards , competition policy , and taxation that are applicable here . so , fundamental considerations speak for deeper European integration , extending even to the creation of a single European state .
the danger of following such a path always lies in the fact that collective decision-making bodies not only provide services that are useful to everybody , but also may abuse their power to redistribute resources among the participating countries . even democratic bodies are not immune to this danger .
the ECB has been providing virtually all of its refinancing credit to the eurozone ’ s five crisis-stricken countries : Italy , Spain , Portugal , Greece , and Ireland . all the money circulating in the eurozone originated in these five countries and was then largely used to buy goods and assets in the northern member countries and redeem foreign debt taken from them .
the US Federal Reserve would never be allowed to conduct such a regionally imbalanced policy . the Fed cannot even provide credit to specific regions , let alone states on the verge of bankruptcy ( for example , California ) .
and now European Council President Herman Van Rompuy , backed by most of the troubled eurozone countries , is again proposing Eurobonds and debt-mutualization schemes . these ideas go well beyond the American system .
Van Rompuy ’ s proposals are extremely dangerous and could destroy Europe . the path toward a union based on joint liabilities , against the wishes of large parts of its population , is not leading to a federal state in the true sense of the term – &amp; # 160 ; that is , to an alliance of equals , who freely decide to unite and promise to protect each other .
it contains many more countries than those that use the euro . as useful as the euro could be for Europe ’ s prosperity if its obvious flaws were corrected , the way that the eurozone is now developing will split the EU and undermine the idea of unity in diversity .
the assertion that the eurozone could be transformed into a United States of Europe is no longer convincing . the path toward joint liability is far more likely to lead to a deep rift within Europe , because turning the eurozone into a transfer and debt union that can prevent the insolvency of any of its members would require more central power than currently exists in the US .
austerity and Demoralization
new HAVEN – The high unemployment that we have today in Europe , the United States , and elsewhere is a tragedy , not just because of the aggregate output loss that it entails , but also because of the personal and emotional cost to the unemployed of not being a part of working society .
British Prime Minister David Cameron , an austerity advocate , says he believes that his program reduces “ welfare dependency , ” restores “ rigor , ” and encourages the “ the doers , the creators , the life-affirmers . ” Likewise , US Congressman Paul Ryan says that his program is part of a plan to promote “ creativity and entrepreneurial spirit . ”
monks find their life ’ s meaning in a most austere environment , and military boot camps are thought to build character . but the kind of fiscal austerity that is being practiced now has the immediate effect of rendering people jobless and filling their lives with nothing but a sense of rejection and exclusion .
some economists even thought long ago that we would be enjoying much more leisure by this point . John Maynard Keynes , in his 1930 essay “ Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren , ” speculated that , within a hundred years , that is , by 2030 , higher incomes would reduce the average workday to a mere three hours , for a total workweek of only 15 hours .
so was Robert Theobald , who , in his 1963 book Free Men and Free Markets questioned the public ’ s repugnance toward high unemployment . he asserted that “ we can have meaningful leisure rather than destructive unemployment , ” and that we do not need “ a whirling-dervish economy dependent on compulsive consumption . ”
but finding something satisfying to do with our time seems inevitably to entail doing some sort of work : “ meaningful leisure ” wears thin after a while . people seem to want to work more than three hours a day , even if it is assembly-line work .
on the traditional family farm , there was no unemployment . austerity exposes the modern economy ’ s lack of interpersonal connectedness and the morale costs that this implies .
work-sharing might keep more people marginally attached to their jobs in an economic slump , thereby preserving their self-esteem . instead of laying off 25 % of its workforce in a recession , a company could temporarily reduce workers ’ hours from , say , eight per day to six .
but work-sharing raises technical problems if increased suddenly to deal with an economic crisis like the one we are now experiencing . these problems preclude the sudden movement toward the ideal of greater leisure that thinkers like Keynes and Theobald proclaimed .
their debts and obligations are similarly fixed . they could have bought a smaller house had they known that their hours would be reduced , but now it is difficult to downsize the one that they did buy .
another problem is that it may be difficult to reduce everyone ’ s job by the same amount , because some jobs scale up and down with production , while others do not .
in his book Why Wages Don ’ t Fall During a Recession , Truman Bewley of Yale University reported on an extensive set of interviews with business managers involved with wage-setting and layoffs . he found that they believed that a serious morale problem would result from reducing everyone ’ s hours and pay during a recession .
in his interviews with managers , he was told that it is best ( at least from a manager ’ s point of view ) if the pain of reduced employment is concentrated on a few people , whose grumbling is not heard by the remaining employees . employers worry about workplace morale , not about the morale of the employees they lay off .
we could perhaps all be happy working fewer hours if the decline reflected gradual social progress . but we are not happy with unemployment that results from a sudden fiscal crisis .
that is why sudden austerity cannot be a morale builder . for morale , we need a social compact that finds a purpose for everyone , a way to show oneself to be part of society by being a worker of some sort .
and for that we need fiscal stimulus – ideally , the debt-friendly stimulus that raises taxes and expenditures equally . the increased tax burden for all who are employed is analogous to the reduced hours in work-sharing .
but , if tax increases are not politically expedient , policymakers should proceed with old-fashioned deficit spending . the important thing is to achieve any fiscal stimulus that boosts job creation and puts the unemployed back to work .
end Austerity Now
Edinburgh – In recent weeks , talk about a budding recovery in the eurozone has gained traction , with key indices pointing to expansion in the core countries – data that many are citing as evidence that austerity is finally working . money-market funds from the United States are returning , albeit cautiously , to resume funding of European bank debt .
cynics recall that a European recovery was supposed to take hold as early as the fourth quarter of 2010 , and that every International Monetary Fund projection since then has predicted recovery “ by the end of the year . ” Instead , GDP has collapsed , with the Spanish and Italian economies expected to contract by close to 2 % this year .
moreover , unemployment in the eurozone has skyrocketed to an average rate of roughly 12 % , with more than 50 % youth unemployment in the periphery countries implying a long-term loss of talent and erosion of the tax base . and , despite the spike in unemployment , productivity growth in the eurozone is decidedly negative .
more significant , over the last year , the public debt / GDP ratio rose by seven percentage points in Italy , 11 in Ireland , and 15 in Portugal and Spain . if the sine qua non of recovery via austerity is the stabilization and reduction of debt , the cynics ’ case appears to have been made .
as it stands , every country that has implemented an austerity program without imposing losses on private creditors has more debt now than when it started . for example , according to official estimates , Spain ’ s public debt , which amounted to only about 36 % of GDP when the crisis began , has almost tripled – and the actual figure may be much higher .
when a country gives up its monetary sovereignty , its banks are effectively borrowing in a foreign currency , making them exceptionally vulnerable to liquidity shocks , like that which sparked turmoil in Europe ’ s banking system in 2010-2011 . the government , unable to print money to bail out the banks or increase export competitiveness through currency devaluation , is left with only two options : default or deflation ( austerity ) .
austerity ’ s underlying logic is that budget cuts , by reducing the debt burden and restoring confidence , ultimately enhance stability and support growth . but , when countries pursue austerity simultaneously with their main trading partners , overall demand plummets , causing all of their economies to contract and , in turn , increasing their debt / GDP ratios .
but the problem with austerity in the eurozone is more fundamental : policymakers are attempting to address a sovereign-debt crisis , though the real problem is a banking crisis . with Europe ’ s banking system triple the size and twice as leveraged as its US counterpart , and the ECB lacking genuine lender-of-last-resort authority , the sudden halt in capital flows to peripheral countries in 2009 created a liquidity-starved system that was too big to bail out .
as holders of euro-denominated assets recognized this situation , they turned to the ECB for insurance ( which the ECB could not deliver under its previous president , Jean-Claude Trichet , whose leadership was defined by his commitment to maintaining price stability ) . investors ’ subsequent efforts to price in the risk of a eurozone breakup – not the volume of sovereign debt – caused bond yields to spike .
but the financial-market turmoil fueled a panic among eurozone leaders , leading them to misdiagnose the malady and prescribe the wrong medicine , which has served only to generate new symptoms . while Draghi ’ s promise , embodied by the ECB ’ s “ outright monetary transactions ” program – as well as its long-term refinancing operation and emergency liquidity assistance program – has bought time and lowered yields , the eurozone ’ s banking crisis persists .
eurozone leaders must recognize that spending cuts will do nothing to stabilize the balance sheets of core-country banks that are over-exposed to peripheral countries ’ sovereign debt . until Europe rejects austerity in favor of a growth-oriented approach , all signs of recovery will prove illusory .
why Barack Obama ?
he will face the most difficult opening-day agenda of any president since – and I say this in all seriousness – the man who saved the Union , Abraham Lincoln . but a more instructive precedent is 1933 , when Franklin Roosevelt offered inspiring rhetoric and “ bold experimentation ” to a nation facing economic meltdown and a breakdown in public confidence .
for me , the choice is simple – and not only because I am , by temperament and history , a Democrat . the long and intense political campaign has revealed huge differences in the two candidates ’ positions , style , and personal qualities .
his selection of Sarah Palin , a charismatic but spectacularly unqualified candidate , as his running mate , is just the most glaring of many examples of the real McCain . his bravery in combat attests to his patriotism , courage , and toughness , but his judgment has been found sorely lacking time and time again over his career .
no one should underestimate how difficult it was to travel his road , against incredible odds , to the cusp of the presidency . but where McCain is impulsive and emotional , Obama is low-key and unemotional .
he consulted the best advisory team in the nation , weighed each course of action carefully , and then issued a series of precise , calm statements . meanwhile , McCain has veered bizarrely , issuing contradictory statements , “ suspending ” his campaign ( while continuing to campaign ) , and urging that the first debate be canceled ( when it was all the more needed ) .
McCain ’ s positions , with the notable exception of climate change , suggest that he would simply try to carry out George W. Bush ’ s policies more effectively . Obama offers a different approach to foreign policy .
on Russia since its invasion of Georgia , Obama and his running mate , Joe Biden ( who was the first member of Congress to visit Georgia after the invasion ) , emphasize helping Georgia rebuild its economy and maintain its independence in the face of a continuing Russian campaign against it . McCain , on the other hand , wants to punish Russia by such actions as expelling it from the G-8 .
such measures may ultimately be necessary , but they will not help Georgia survive as an independent democracy . moreover , even after the outrage in Georgia , there are issues of common interest – such as energy , climate change , and Iran – on which the West and the Kremlin must cooperate .
in the end , all presidential elections come down to the intangibles of leadership . the vote for a president is a sort of private contract directly between each voter and his or her preferred choice .
here again , the contrasting styles of Obama and McCain offer a clear choice between a calm and confident man and a highly emotional one , between a major change in the nation ’ s direction and a minor one , between a conciliatory style and a more combative one .
finally , in a year in which the Democrats are certain to increase their majority in both houses of Congress , an Obama victory would offer the Democrats control of both the legislative and executive branches for the first time since 1994 , and with it the possibility of legislative achievement after years of stalemate . after so many years of polarization at home and unilateralism abroad , the choice for president seems clear .
why Big Banks Will Get Bigger
the lessons learned in the immediate aftermath bear little relationship to the eventual outcome . there are immediate and obvious answers to the question of who was to blame , but they rarely correspond with the new shape of the financial landscape that ultimately emerges .
the explanation of why the obvious lessons of the crisis are being not drawn lies in the curious character of financial activity . banking is inherently competitive ; but at the same time , it is not an industry where competition ever worked very well .
the core of financial activity depends on reputation , information networks , and the ability to make markets as well as trade on them . the result is that there are indisputable advantages to being big , as well as the disadvantages that have become obvious over the past two years .
in the old days , when banking was stable and regulated securely in a national setting , three or four leading banks tended to form an oligopoly : Barclays , Lloyds , Midland , and National Westminster in the United Kingdom ; Commerzbank , Deutsche , and Dresdner in Germany .
in the 1990 ’ s and 2000 ’ s , internationalization promised to produce a new landscape , in which a small handful of banks would once again divide up a single global market . banks maneuvered to get the best position to take advantage of financial globalization , which usually meant locating themselves where the regulatory regime was least restrictive .
as they grew , banks found it difficult to manage the multiplicity of their divergent activities . they were beset with incompatible computer software systems , rogue employees , and the need to account for the different national cultures in which they were now operating .
almost inevitably , the biggest banks in the world got into trouble . in the 1990 ’ s , the largest banks were mostly Japanese .
from banks ’ perspective , the most obvious lesson was the need for a strong national government to bear the potential costs of a rescue . it is no longer best to be subject to the most favorable regulatory regime , but to be where the state has the deepest pockets .
very large banks in small territories with small-scale governments are vulnerable . the US is big enough to handle behemoths like Bank of America or Citigroup .
even in France and Germany , large and internationally active banks potentially exceed the government ’ s capacity to mount a rescue . in addition , there is the complexity of disentangling which country is responsible for what part of a rescue , when , for instance , Central European banks are controlled by an Austrian bank that is bought by a German bank that is then bought by an Italian bank .
as a result , the big transnational institutions are lobbying hard for a pan-European approach to banking supervision and regulation ( and implicitly for fiscal bailouts should that supervision and regulation fail ) .
in the case of the banks that required state rescues , European competition rules are requiring divestment and downsizing . institutions such as Royal Bank of Scotland , which for a time in 2009 headed the list of the world ’ s largest international banks , are being pruned by the EU ’ s Directorate General for Competition .
even the stronger banks are being pressed to increase their capital reserves . in most cases , this means that they will continue to cut back on lending , worsening the impact of the financial crisis on the rest of the economy .
by contrast , in the US , the government pushed big banks into buying up smaller and vulnerable banks , and is now doing everything it can to press them to lend more .
the more we insist that a banking system should be competitive , the greater the risks that individual banks will take . the more governments are prepared to step in , and the greater the resources of those governments , the more big banks and big countries will be favored .
the last 20 years of globalization saw the emergence of small , open economies as global leaders . the next 20 years will see a different globalization , in which the winners are large , powerful countries that mobilize government resources in the interest of creating winners in the race for financial supremacy .
why Bipartisanship is Good Politics
London – Bipartisanship seems to have taken a drubbing in Washington since President Barack Obama got to the White House .
like most recent American presidents , Obama campaigned on a promise to work with his political opponents for the greater good of the country . bill Clinton said much the same thing before he was elected , and then spent his first term in a knockdown fight with Newt Gingrich ’ s Republican majority in Congress , and his second term fighting off impeachment .
George W. Bush also said that he would reach out to those who disagreed with him . he then turned into the most partisan and ideological president of modern times , egged on by his vice-president , Dick Cheney .
his selection of Republicans for key posts – including retaining Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense – has raised a few eyebrows among his supporters . but , above all , he has tried hard to secure Republican support for his efforts to prevent the economy from disappearing into a deep recessionary hole .
only three maverick Republican Senators went along with Obama ’ s proposals to get the plan accepted . and in the House of Representatives , the Republicans unanimously rejected every amendment , every compromise , and every courtesy that he offered .
first , he promised bipartisanship , but got heavily rebuffed . second , he and his administration were so busy trying to build consensus that they watered down some of the vital ingredients of the stimulus package , and failed to defend it robustly from Republican attack .
here we have had Republicans criticizing an increase in America ’ s budget deficit after doubling America ’ s national debt in the Bush presidency ’ s eight years . moreover , Republicans ’ belief that only tax cuts , not public spending , will delivery recovery is a sad example of blinkered ideology .
but there are more positive reasons for Obama effort at bipartisanship . in any democratic system of checks and balances , leaders usually require coalitions in order to get what they want done .
most voters – certainly swing voters , who usually decide elections – do not like partisan battles as much as some politicians and their supporters do . after all , the wise , the moderate , and the floating voter do not switch on the radio to listen to archconservatives like the American broadcaster Rush Limbaugh .
when things get tough in politics , as will happen in most of the world as we struggle with the impact of the global recession , every sensible government will try to hang on to the benefit of doubt . it is the most important attribute in politics .
but he did so without ever seeming to despise his opponents or disparage their intentions . Obama ’ s aides have confessed that he modeled his own election program on the sunny and optimistic decency of the Republican actor .
civility in politics is not simply political confectionery . a leader who respects his or her opponents is more likely to earn respect himself than one who doubts their patriotism and resents their criticism .
Jawaharlal Nehru was hugely popular because he was known to cherish free speech , take seriously the views of his critics , and defend their right to disagree with him . his role in establishing enduring democracy in India , despite the tensions of caste , ethnicity , religion , and regional loyalties , made him one of the towering figures of the twentieth century .
did the Bankers Do It ?
new DELHI – Few areas of economic activity in the United States are more politicized than housing finance . yet the intellectual left has gone to great lengths to absolve regulators , government lending mandates , and agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of any responsibility for the housing boom and the subsequent bust .
the rationale is clear : if these officials , institutions , and policies were held accountable , the reform agenda would necessarily shift from regulating greedy bankers and their bonuses to asking broader questions . might government mandates contribute to bad behavior by private players ?
the left has had an easy task in dominating the debate , partly because the intellectual right ’ s attempt to place all the blame for the crisis on government is thoroughly implausible . it is far more defensible and correct to argue that everyone – bankers , households , regulators , and politicians – contributed to ( and took credit for ) the boom while it lasted , only to point fingers at one another when it collapsed .
but bankers ’ political tin ear in the aftermath of the crisis – first taking public bailouts and then paying themselves huge bonuses as if nothing had changed – ensured that they got the lion ’ s share of the blame , with everyone else willing to pose as their unwitting victims . as a result , the public-policy response has been dominated by “ the bankers did it ” narrative .
the left has dismissed any claim that the CRA played a role in the housing boom by pointing out that it was enacted in 1977 , while the subprime boom played out in the early 2000 ’ s . but this ignores the possibility that regulators may have started to enforce the CRA rigorously only later .
to enforce the statute , regulators periodically examine banks for CRA compliance . to hone in on the “ regulatory enforcement ” effect , the recent study compares the behavior of banks that are undergoing examination ( which takes place over several quarters ) to that of banks that are not undergoing examination in a particular tract in a particular month .
compared to banks that are not undergoing examination , the volume of loans by banks in the six quarters surrounding a CRA examination is 5 % higher , and these loans are 15 % more likely to be delinquent one year after origination . in other words , banks undergoing examination lend more and make riskier loans – and these findings are even more pronounced in CRA-eligible tracts .
regulators ’ primary tool to enforce compliance was their authority to reject non-CRA-compliant banks ’ requests for new branches or mergers . during the subprime boom , large banks were more likely to want to expand , and thus had greater incentive to comply .
at the height of the lending frenzy ( 2004-2006 ) , the study finds that banks loaned even more in response to an examination , and that the outcomes were even worse . the authors speculate that easier loan securitization may have made risky CRA-compliant loans seem less costly .
because of the way it is structured , the study only suggests a lower bound on the effects of CRA compliance . it focuses on the differential impact of the CRA on banks undergoing examination and those not undergoing examination .
there is room in economics for grand speculation – some part intuition , some part common sense , and some part ideology . if economists were to wait for careful studies before offering opinions about policy , we would never have anything timely to say .
but there is a danger that the public mistakes speculation for truth , only because of the speculator ’ s credentials and assertiveness . studies like this one are useful in setting the record straight .
households , politicians , and regulators were also complicit . as we go about the process of reform , we should bear in mind that the only thing worse than fighting the last war is fighting the wrong last war .
why Border Walls Fail
in 2015 , Estonia , Hungary , Kenya , Saudi Arabia , and Tunisia all announced or began the construction of barriers on their frontiers . we may live in an era of globalization , but much of the world is increasingly focused on limiting the free movement of people .
the Republican frontrunner , Donald Trump , has repeatedly proposed building a wall along the entire border with Mexico . and on a Sunday morning talk show , another Republican candidate , Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker , described building a wall on the US-Canada border as “ a legitimate issue for us to look at . ”
according to US Customs and Border Protection , building and maintaining the existing 670 miles of border fencing on the US-Mexico border would cost $ 6.5 billion over the barrier ’ s expected 20-year life cycle . at this price , fortifying the remaining 1,300 miles of the Mexico border would cost more than $ 12.6 billion .
but even prison walls are only as effective as the guards who ensure that they are not breached , and guards can be susceptible to bribes . the recent escape of the drug cartel leader Joaquin “ El Chapo ” Guzman from a Mexican prison highlights another vulnerability of border walls : tunnels .
indeed , fortified frontiers are most effective at stopping poor migrants and refugees . and even then , rather than preventing migrants from entering , fortifications all too often funnel them toward more dangerous crossing points .
unlike prison perimeters , borders can be thousands of miles long , which makes them difficult to monitor properly . the US employs more than 20,000 Border Patrol agents ; but even if they were all on duty at the same time , each would need to guard a 1,700-foot section of the border .
of course , equipment like cameras , motion sensors , drones , helicopters , and vehicles allow agents to watch long sections of the border . but the necessity of monitoring border walls points to one of the fundamental truths about them : historically , most have proved to be pretty useless .
indeed , border guards and their equipment can be equally effective without a physical barrier . at best , walls and fences only slow people down , making them a poor investment from a security standpoint .
they provide imposingly tangible evidence that something is being done about migration . high-tech surveillance and boots on the ground may be more effective at preventing people from crossing a border , but a wall can be used as a political prop .
if Trump ever builds his wall , he should build a really nice one , like the Great Wall of China . then one day it might become a popular tourist attraction – and finally serve a useful purpose .
football Fury
there they were , Brazilians , protesting outside football stadiums against their country hosting the World Cup in 2014 – &amp; # 160 ; and this even as their national team was thrashing Spain in the final of the Confederations Cup . it was as if Catholics were to protest outside the Vatican against picking a new Pope .
regardless of their economic , racial , or political differences , all Brazilians are uplifted by having the best team in the world , winning the World Cup many times , and inventing and reinventing “ the beautiful game . ” Staging the next World Cup in Brazil , as well as the Olympic Games in 2016 , even though the football tournament alone will cost up to $ 13 billion , seems a logical move .
so what possessed the 19-year-old Brazilian male who told reporters : “ We don ’ t need the World Cup . we need education , better health services , more humane police . ”
if so , it is not the game itself that they have forsaken , but rather the kind of game that football has become : a billion-dollar business , a prestige object for louche plutocrats , and an extravagant showpiece for corrupt governments and international sporting organizations .
some clubs were financed by industrial corporations in order to promote loyalty among their workers : Philips sponsored the Dutch club PSV Eindhoven , for example , while Fiat played the same role for Italy ’ s Juventus . but , regardless of the sponsorship or the location , fans felt close to most of the clubs , as well as to their national teams .
this is still true to some extent , but something crucial has changed : football , like other types of commerce , has gone global . thanks to new ownership rules , cable television , product endorsements , and other business-related factors , there are probably more supporters of Manchester United in China than there are in the United Kingdom , let alone in the city of Manchester .
but this alone does not account for the kind of alienation from the game expressed by the Brazilian protesters . the worldwide reach of football was preceded by that of the Olympic Games , and it is here where we should turn to understand the corruption of globalized sports .
unlike football , the Olympics were always closely associated with elites : amateur athletes recruited from universities , and so on . the father of the modern Olympic Games , Baron de Courbertin , was a French aristocrat who promoted sports to reinvigorate the men of France after their defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871 .
how easily this ideal could be corrupted by distinctly ungentlemanly politics was already clear in 1936 , when Coubertin ’ s doddering speech about peace and fair play was played over the loudspeakers of the Olympic Stadium in Berlin , while Hitler and his henchmen raised their arms to salute the Nazi flag .
but even without noisome politics , the sheer amount of money required to stage the Olympic Games – the building contracts for stadiums , transport infrastructure , and hotels , together with all the other commercial razzmatazz – was bound to produce a culture of bribery and kickbacks . an international elite of Olympic officials arose , living in a self-contained bubble of wealth and privilege .
I once had occasion to watch these men as they trooped in and out of first-class hotels in an Asian capital , sleek figures in gold-buttoned blazers . it was striking to see how often the most prosperous-looking representatives came from the world ’ s poorest countries .
football is now like the Olympics ( or Formula 1 racing ) , except that even more money is involved . football clubs have become the status symbols of newly rich tycoons from Russia or the Middle East , and international competitions , especially the World Cup , have become occasions to bolster the prestige , and sometimes even the legitimacy , of national governments .
but once they have staged their spectacles , at vast expense to the host country , they move on . this is especially galling in countries where much of the population is poor and deprived of decent schools or proper medical services .
they haven ’ t fallen out of love with football . on the contrary , by protesting against the grotesque manipulation of the modern game , they are trying to take it back .
BRICS Without Mortar
three years ago , I was skeptical about the BRICS . and , despite the recent summit ’ s apparent success , I still am .
as O ’ Neill recently told China Daily , “ South Africa is quite fortunate enough to be in the group , as , economically , it is rather small compared to the others . ” Moreover , its economic performance has been relatively sluggish , with a growth rate of just 2.3 % last year .
and , while the large autocracies , Russia and China , find it diplomatically advantageous to tweak the Americans , both have different but crucial relationships with the United States . and both have worked to thwart efforts by India , Brazil , and South Africa to become permanent members of the United Nations Security Council .
as I wrote three years ago , in analytical terms , it makes little sense to include Russia , a former superpower , with the developing economies . Russia lacks diversified exports , faces severe demographic and health problems , and , in former President Dmitri Medvedev ’ s words , “ greatly needs modernization . ”
like Brazil , India experienced a spurt of output growth after liberalizing its economy in the 1990 ’ s ; indeed , until a few years ago , GDP growth was approaching Chinese-style rates . this year , however , output is expected to rise by a relatively sluggish 5.9 % .
so , should we take today ’ s BRICS more seriously than the BRICs of three years ago ?
in political terms , China , India , and Russia are vying with each other for power in Asia . and , in economic terms , Brazil , India , and South Africa are concerned about the effects of China ’ s undervalued currency on their economies .
three years ago , I wrote that , “ BRIC is not likely to become a serious political organization of like-minded states . ” The BRICS ’ most recent meeting has given me no reason to revise that assessment .
why Capital Flows Uphill
emerging-market countries run current-account surpluses , while advanced economies have deficits . one would expect fast-growing , capital-scarce &amp; nbsp ; ( and young ) &amp; nbsp ; developing countries to be importing capital from the rest of world to finance consumption and investment .
with its current-account surplus averaging 5.5 % of GDP in 2000-2008 , China has become one of the world ’ s largest lenders . despite its rapid growth and promising investment opportunities , the country has persistently been sending a significant portion of its savings overseas . &amp; nbsp ;
other emerging markets – including Brazil , Russia , India , Mexico , Argentina , Thailand , Indonesia , Malaysia , and the Middle Eastern oil exporters – have all increased their current-account surpluses significantly since the early 1990 ’ s . collectively , capital-scarce developing countries are lending to capital-abundant advanced economies .
many observers believe that these global imbalances reflect developing economies ’ financial integration , coupled with underdevelopment of domestic financial markets . according to this view , these countries ’ demand for assets cannot be met – in terms of both quantity and quality – &amp; nbsp ; at home , so they deploy part of their savings to countries like the US , which can offer a more diverse array of quality assets .
while plausible , this argument suggests that , as financial markets improve over time in developing countries , the global imbalances are bound to shrink . but such a reversal is nowhere in sight .
a crucial dimension of globalization has been trade liberalization . for China , foreign trade as a percentage of GDP soared from 25 % in 1989 to 66 % in 2006 , largely owing to its admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001 . &amp; nbsp ;
this has allowed advanced economies , in turn , to produce and export more capital-intensive , higher-value-added products . globalization of trade enabled countries to tap the efficiency gains that specialization in their sectors of comparative advantage has brought about .
with a slight mental stretch , one can imagine that what a country produces and trades may affect its savings and investment decisions . an economy in which the main productive activity is berry picking , for example , has little need for investment and capital accumulation .
that may be an extreme example , but it illustrates a more general point about how merchandise trade can influence financial flows . countries that produce and export more labor-intensive goods – perhaps owing to increased trade openness , or faster labor-force and productivity growth , all of which are true of China – may experience a rise in saving , but a less-than-equivalent increase in demand for capital .
rich countries , by contrast , are able to export more capital-intensive goods , and thus have a greater need for investment . so they may be importing more capital – resulting in a greater current-account deficit – simply because they are producing more capital-intensive goods .
with developing countries – in particular , China , India , and the ex-Soviet bloc – bringing almost 1.5 billion workers into the world economy since the early 1990 ’ s , it is not difficult to understand the potential impact of this effect . after all , much of this labor force was absorbed by labor-intensive industries that eventually churned out products exported to the rest of the world .
as developing countries increased their labor-intensive production and exports , their current-account surpluses rose – by almost 3.6 percentage points , on average , between 1989-1993 and 2002-2006 . China ’ s current-account surplus increased by almost 11 percentage points over the same period , India ’ s by 2.5 percentage points , and Russia ’ s by seven percentage points .
this pattern contrasts with that of the United States and many other advanced countries , which have experienced a deterioration of their current-account balances as their production and exports have become more capital-intensive .
many might doubt the view that China is exporting more labor-intensive goods , rather than upgrading its exports on the capital- and skill-intensity ladder . but trade data suggest the opposite , perhaps because China ’ s accession to the WTO led to tariff reductions that released more labor-intensive production .
China has witnessed rapid growth in the processing trade : assembling intermediate inputs – imported from countries like the US and Japan – that have high capital and skill content . so , while the exports of these final goods may count towards China ’ s own capital and skill content , the country ’ s real role was only in the labor-intensive process of assembly .
a country ’ s production structure may very well determine how much capital it supplies and how much it needs . so the fact that capital may flow towards rich countries that produce and export more capital-intensive goods should not be so puzzling , after all .
why China Can ’ t Adjust
but China ’ s vulnerability to these factors , as serious as they are , is symptomatic of deeper institutional problems . until these underlying constraints are addressed , talk of a new consumption-based growth model for China , reflected in the government ’ s recently approved 12th Five-Year Plan , can be no more than lip service .
after all , China ’ s major trading partners , international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , and senior Chinese officials themselves have long recognized the structural vulnerabilities caused by excessive investment and low household consumption . and , for nearly a decade , China has been urged to undertake reforms to redress these economic patterns , which have undermined the welfare of ordinary Chinese and strained the global trading system .
the best-known feature of China ’ s macroeconomic imbalances is heavy dependence on exports for growth , which is typically attributed to weak domestic demand : as a middle-income country , China lacks the purchasing power to consume the goods that it produces . with nearly unlimited access to advanced-country markets , China can tap into global external demand and raise its GDP growth potential , as it has done for the past two decades .
if this view is right , the solution is straightforward : China can correct its imbalances by increasing its citizens ’ incomes ( by cutting taxes , raising wages , or increasing social spending ) , so that they can consume more , thereby reducing the economy ’ s dependence on exports . indeed , nearly all mainstream economists prescribe this approach for China .
but there is another explanation for China ’ s excessive export dependence , one that has more to do with the country ’ s poor political and economic institutions . specifically , export dependence partly reflects the high degree of difficulty of doing business in China .
by contrast , if China ’ s private firms sell to Western multinationals , such as Wal-Mart , Target , or Home Depot , they do not have to worry about getting paid . they can avoid all of the headaches that they would have encountered at home , because well-established economic institutions and business practices in their export markets protect their interests and greatly reduce transaction costs .
in its June 2011 survey , China was ranked 91st , behind Mongolia , Albania , and Belarus . it is particularly difficult to start a business in China ( 151st ) , pay taxes ( 122nd ) , obtain construction permits ( 179th ) , and get electricity ( 115th ) .
faced with such a hostile environment , Chinese private entrepreneurs have been forced to engage in “ institutional arbitrage ” – taking advantage of efficient Western economic institutions to expand their business ( most export-oriented businesses are owned by private entrepreneurs and foreign firms ) .
unfortunately , as China has already claimed a large share of the world ’ s merchandise exports ( 10.4 % in 2010 ) and economic stagnation in the West is constraining external demand , this strategy can no longer work . but reorienting their businesses toward the Chinese domestic market requires far more than government policies that put more money in consumers &apos; pockets .
in order to enjoy the same low transaction costs that they have in exporting , China ’ s entrepreneurs need a much better business environment : an effective legal system , a sound regulatory framework , a government that protects their brands by fighting intellectual-property theft , dependable logistics and distribution networks , and a graft-resistant bureaucracy .
in essence , the Chinese government must transform a predatory state into a nurturing one , and treat private entrepreneurs as creators of wealth rather than targets of extraction . in nearly all other countries , such a transformation was accomplished by establishing the rule of law and / or moving from autocracy to democracy .
ever since it crushed the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989 , the party has vowed not to surrender its political monopoly . the investment boom and the globalization dividend of the last two decades allowed the Party to have its cake and eat it – maintaining its rule on the basis of economic prosperity , while failing to establish the institutions critical to sustaining such prosperity .
so in a sense , the Chinese bubble – as much an intellectual and political bubble as an economic one – has burst . as China ’ s economic deceleration exposes its structural vulnerabilities and flawed policies , the much-hyped notion of “ Chinese exceptionalism ” – that China can continue to grow without the rule of law and the other essential institutions that a modern market economy presupposes – is proving to be nothing but a delusion .
the Lessons of the China-India War
yet that war failed to resolve the disputes between the world ’ s two most populous countries , and its legacy continues to weigh down the bilateral relationship . while their economic heft is drawing increasing international attention , their underlying strategic rivalry over issues ranging from land and water to geopolitical influence in other regions usually attracts less notice .
the international importance of the China-India relationship reflects the fact that together they account for 37 % of humanity . although they represent markedly different cultures and competing models of development , they share a historical similarity that helps shape both countries ’ diplomacy : each freed itself from colonial powers around the same time .
throughout their histories , the Indian and Chinese civilizations were separated by the vast Tibetan plateau , limiting their interaction to sporadic cultural and religious contacts ; political relations were absent . it was only after China ’ s annexation of Tibet in 1950-1951 that Han Chinese troops appeared for the first time on India ’ s Himalayan frontiers .
just over a decade later , China surprised India ’ s ill-prepared army by launching a multi-pronged attack across the Himalayas on October 20 , 1962 . Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai publicly said that the war was intended “ to teach India a lesson . ”
taking an enemy by surprise confers a significant tactical advantage in war , and the invasion inflicted an immense psychological and political shock on India that greatly magnified the initial military advances that China achieved . China ’ s blitzkrieg created a defeatist mindset in India , forcing its army to retreat to defensive positions .
just as Mao Zedong started his invasion of Tibet while the world was preoccupied with the Korean War , so he chose a perfect time to invade India , as recommended by the ancient strategist Sun Tzu . the attack coincided with a major international crisis that brought the United States and the Soviet Union within a whisker of nuclear war over the stealthy deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba .
Mao ’ s shrewd timing ensured India ’ s isolation from sources of international support . throughout the invasion , the international spotlight was on the potential US-Soviet nuclear showdown , not on the bloody war raging in the Himalayan foothills .
India ’ s humiliating rout hastened the death of its prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru ; but it also set in motion the country ’ s military modernization and political rise .
fifty years later , tensions between India and China are rising again amid an intense geopolitical rivalry . their entire 4,057-kilometer border – one of the longest in the world – remains in dispute , without a clearly defined line of control in the Himalayas .
in fact , these talks constitute the longest and most futile negotiating process between any two countries in modern history . during a 2010 visit to New Delhi , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao stated bluntly that sorting out the border disputes “ will take a fairly long period of time . ”
as old wounds fester , new issues have begun roiling bilateral relations . for example , since 2006 China has initiated a new territorial dispute by claiming the eastern sector ( the Austria-size Arunachal Pradesh state ) , from which its forces withdrew in 1962 , describing it as “ Southern Tibet . ”
a perceptible hardening of China ’ s stance toward India since then is also reflected in other developments , including Chinese strategic projects and the country ’ s military presence in the Pakistani-held portion of Kashmir , a region where the disputed borders of India , China , and Pakistan converge .
in response , India has been beefing up its military deployments along the border to prevent any Chinese land grab . it has also launched a crash program to improve its logistical capabilities by constructing new roads , airstrips , and advanced landing stations along the Himalayas .
the larger strategic rivalry between the world ’ s largest autocracy and its biggest democracy has also sharpened , despite their fast-rising trade . in the past decade , bilateral trade has risen more than 20-fold , to $ 73.9 billion , making it the only area in which bilateral relations have thrived .
far from helping to turn the page on old disputes , this commerce has been accompanied by greater Sino-Indian geopolitical rivalry and military tension . booming bilateral trade is no guarantee of moderation between countries .
China is Not Collapsing
London – One question has dominated the International Monetary Fund ’ s annual meeting this year in Peru : will China ’ s economic downturn trigger a new financial crisis just as the world is putting the last one to bed ? but the assumption underlying that question – that China is now the global economy ’ s weakest link – is highly suspect .
China certainly experienced a turbulent summer , owing to three factors : economic weakness , financial panic , and the policy response to these problems . while none on its own would have threatened the world economy , the danger stemmed from a self-reinforcing interaction among them : weak economic data leads to financial turmoil , which induces policy blunders that in turn fuel more financial panic , economic weakness , and policy mistakes .
such self-reinforcing financial feedback is much more powerful in transmitting global economic contagion than ordinary commercial or trade exposures , as the world learned in 2008-2009 . the question now is whether the vicious circle that began in China over the summer will continue .
China ’ s growth slowdown is not in itself surprising or alarming . as the IMF noted , China ’ s growth rate has been declining steadily for five years – from 10.6 % in 2010 to a projected rate of 6.8 % this year and 6.3 % in 2016 .
this deceleration was inevitable as China advanced from extreme poverty and technological backwardness to become a middle-income economy powered by external trade and consumer spending . it was also desirable , because rapid growth was hitting environmental limits .
even as the pace of growth slows , China is contributing more to the world economy than ever before , because its GDP today is $ 10.3 trillion , up from just $ 2.3 trillion in 2005 . simple arithmetic shows that $ 10.3 trillion growing at 6 % or 7 % produces much bigger numbers than 10 % growth starting from a base that is almost five times smaller .
yet China is causing high anxiety , especially in emerging countries , largely because financial markets have convinced themselves that its economy is not only slowing , but falling off a cliff . many Western analysts , especially in financial institutions , treat China ’ s official GDP growth of around 7 % as a political fabrication – and the IMF ’ s latest confirmation of its 6.8 % estimate is unlikely to convince them .
but why do the skeptics accept the truth of dismal government figures for construction and steel output – down 15 % and 4 % , respectively , in the year to August – and then dismiss official data showing 10.8 % retail-sales growth ?
Soros has argued for years that financial markets can create inaccurate expectations and then change reality to accord with them . this is the opposite of the process described in textbooks and built into economic models , which always assume that financial expectations adapt to reality , not the other way round .
in a classic example of reflexivity , when China ’ s stock-market boom turned into July ’ s bust , the government responded with a $ 200 billion attempt to support prices , closely followed by a small devaluation of the previously stable renminbi . financial analysts almost universally ridiculed these policies and castigated Chinese leaders for abandoning their earlier pretenses of market-oriented reforms .
this belief quickly shaped reality , as market analysts blurred the distinction between a growth slowdown and economic collapse . in mid-September , for example , when the private-sector Purchasing Managers ’ Index ( PMI ) came out at 47.0 , the result was generally reported along these lines : “ The index has now indicated contraction in the &#91; manufacturing &#93; sector for seven consecutive months . ”
the supposed evidence was wrong because 50 is the PMI ’ s dividing line not between growth and recession , but between accelerating and slowing growth . indeed , for 19 out of the PMI ’ s 36 months of existence , the value has been below 50 , while Chinese manufacturing growth has averaged 7.5 % .
exaggerations of this kind have undermined confidence in Chinese policy at a particularly dangerous time . China is now navigating a complex economic transition that involves three sometimes-conflicting objectives : creating a market-based consumer economy ; reforming the financial system ; and ensuring an orderly slowdown that avoids the economic collapse often accompanying industrial restructuring and financial liberalization .
managing this trifecta successfully will require skillful juggling of priorities – and that will become much more difficult if Chinese policymakers lose international investors ’ trust or , more important , that of China ’ s own citizens and businesses .
vicious circles of economic instability , devaluation , and capital flight have brought down seemingly unbreakable regimes throughout history . this probably explains the whiff of panic that followed China ’ s tiny , but totally unexpected , devaluation of the renminbi .
the renminbi , however , has recently stabilized , and capital flight has dwindled , as evidenced by the better-than-expected reserve figures released by the People ’ s Bank of China on October 7 . this suggests that the government ’ s policy of shifting gradually to a market-based exchange rate may have been better executed than generally believed ; even the measures to support the stock market now look less futile than they did in July .
indeed , China can probably avoid the financial meltdown widely feared in the summer . if so , other emerging economies tied to perceptions about China ’ s economic health should also stabilize .
the world has learned since 2008 how dangerously financial expectations can interact with policy blunders , turning modest economic problems into major catastrophes , first in the US and then in the eurozone . it would be ironic if China ’ s Communist leaders turned out to have a better understanding of capitalism ’ s reflexive interactions among finance , the real economy , and government than Western devotees of free markets .
why China is Right on the Renminbi
Berkeley – After a period of high tension between the United States and China , culminating earlier this month in rumblings of an all-out trade war , it is now evident that a change in Chinese exchange-rate policy is coming . China is finally prepared to let the renminbi resume its slow but steady upward march .
others , who see a substantially undervalued renminbi as a significant factor in US unemployment , will be disappointed by gradual adjustment . they would have preferred a sharp revaluation of perhaps 20 % in order to make a noticeable dent in the US unemployment rate .
China is running external surpluses because its saving exceeds its investment . the US is running external deficits because of a national savings shortfall , which once reflected spendthrift households but now is the fault of a feckless government .
there is no reason , they conclude , why a change in the renminbi-dollar exchange rate should have a first-order impact on savings or investment in China , much less in the US . there is no reason , therefore , why it should have a first-order impact on the bilateral current-account balance , or , for that matter , on unemployment , which depends on the same saving and investment behavior .
China was right to wait in adjusting its exchange rate , and it is now right to move gradually rather than discontinuously . the Chinese economy is growing at potential : forecasts put the prospective rate for 2010 at 10 % ; the first-quarter flash numbers , at 11.9 % , show it expanding as fast as any economy can safely grow .
China successfully navigated the crisis , avoiding a significant slowdown , by ramping up public spending . but , as a result , it now has no further scope for increasing public consumption or investment .
to be sure , building a social safety net , developing financial markets , and strengthening corporate governance to encourage state enterprises to pay out more of what they earn would encourage Chinese households to consume . but such reforms take years to complete .
as a result , Chinese policymakers have been waiting to see whether the recovery in the US is real . if it is , China ’ s exports will grow more rapidly .
without that exchange-rate adjustment , faster export growth would expose the Chinese economy to the risk of overheating . but , with the adjustment , Chinese consumers will spend more on imports and less on domestic goods .
as always , there is no guarantee . but the latest data on sales of light vehicles , as well as the Institute of Supply Management ’ s manufacturing index and the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report , all point in this direction .
because the increase in US spending on Chinese exports will be gradual , it also is appropriate for the adjustment in the renminbi-dollar exchange rate to be gradual . if China recklessly revalued its exchange rate by 20 % , as certain foreigners recommend , the result could be a sharp fall in spending on its goods , which would undermine growth .
US growth will be driven by the recovery of investment , which fell precipitously during the crisis . but , as investment now rises relative to saving , there is a danger that the US current-account deficit , which fell from 6 % of GDP in 2006 to barely 2.5 % of GDP last year , will widen again .
renminbi appreciation that switches Chinese spending toward foreign goods , including US exports , will work against this tendency . by giving American firms more earnings , it will increase corporate savings in the US .
Chinese officials have been on the receiving end of a lot of gratuitous advice . they have been wise to disregard it .
China ’ s Reform Anxiety
Beijing – Since 2010 , global financial circles have been obsessing about China ’ s slowing economy . but , while the country barely met the official target of 7.5 % annual GDP growth in the second quarter of this year – generating significant anxiety worldwide – China ’ s government seemingly remains calm , showing no indication that it plans to launch yet another stimulus package .
but , despite well-intentioned statements and narrow gestures , China ’ s new leadership has yet to establish a concrete , bold reform plan capable of resolving the economy ’ s deep-rooted problems .
for example , last February , the State Council announced plans to reform the hukou ( household registration ) system , which assigns legal residency according to a person ’ s place of birth . the system makes relocating very difficult , as those who do not manage to acquire local residency permits face major hurdles in gaining access to public services when they migrate to other provinces .
the reform plan was supposed to improve the situation by allowing migrants in towns and small cities to acquire local residency permits more freely , while easing the requirements in medium-sized cities . but efforts to reform the system have been met with strong resistance , especially from local governments and residents , who fear the strain that unregulated migration to their cities will have on resources , employment , and services .
hopes were high early this year , when the State Council announced a strategy aimed at liberalizing the capital account , establishing a more flexible exchange-rate policy , and opening the financial sector to domestic private capital . but the government then heeded influential economists ’ warnings of the risks of relaxing capital controls too hastily .
narrow policies like the government ’ s recent credit tightening will make it difficult to direct financial resources to the real economy – one of the primary objectives of “ Likonomics . ” Genuine progress depends on Chinese leaders ’ willingness to address the structural flaws – namely , the restrictions on domestic private capital – that are impeding the financial system ’ s ability to channel savings to the most promising economic sectors .
despite several rounds of deregulation , it remains very difficult to establish private banks in China , and rules on non-banking financial institutions are often unclear . as a result , shadow banking , which provides capital at triple the cost implied by the official base interest rate , is flourishing – and generating significant uncertainty and risk .
in many other areas , too , China ’ s government either remains indecisive or is offering only rhetoric and small gestures . for example , the devolution of some project-approval powers to local governments will not solve the underlying problem of excessive state intervention in the economy ; on the contrary , it may even enhance the state ’ s role by giving local governments more freedom to carry out investment projects .
but , as their efforts over the last several months have highlighted , they are uncertain as to how to go about fixing it – a fact that is generating significant anxiety in financial markets and among the general public . as senior Chinese officials gather for their annual summer meeting in Beidaihe , a coastal resort near Beijing , they must recognize the need for a bold plan for genuine structural reform .
why Cutting Carbon Emissions is not Enough
twenty years ago , governments adopted the Montreal Protocol , a treaty to protect the Earth ’ s ozone layer from emissions of destructive chemicals . few could have foreseen how far-reaching that decision would prove to be .
the Protocol explicitly aimed at phasing-out substances such as chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) – found in products such as refrigerators , foams , and hairsprays – in order to repair the thin gassy-shield that filters out the sun ’ s harmful , ultra-violet rays . by 2010 , close to 100 ozone-depleting substances , including CFCs , will have been phased-out globally .
without the decisions taken 20 years ago , atmospheric levels of ozone-depleting substances would have increased ten-fold by 2050 . this could have led to up to 20 million additional cases of skin cancer and 130 million more cases of eye cataracts , not to speak of damage to human immune systems , wildlife , and agriculture .
but this is only part of the story that we celebrate on the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer ( September 16 ) . over the past two years , it has been established that the Montreal Protocol has also spared humanity a significant level of climate change , because the gases that it prohibits also contribute to global warming .
indeed , a study in 2007 calculated the climate mitigation benefits of the ozone treaty as totalling the equivalent of 135 billion tons of CO2 since 1990 , or a delay in global warming of 7-12 years .
scientists now estimate that somewhere close to 50 % of climate change is being caused by gases and pollutants other than CO2 , including nitrogen compounds , low-level ozone formed by pollution , and black carbon . of course , a degree of scientific uncertainty about some of these pollutants ’ precise contribution to warming remains .
meanwhile , many of these gases need to be curbed because of their wider environmental impact on public health , agriculture , and the planet ’ s multi-trillion dollar ecosystems , including forests .
one study estimates that 26 % of black carbon emissions are from stoves for heating and cooking , with more than 40 % of this amount from wood burning , roughly 20 % from coal , 19 % from crop residues , and 10 % from dung .
some companies have developed stoves that use passive air flows , better insulation , and 60 % less wood to reduce black carbon emissions by around 70 % . mass introduction of such stoves could deliver multiple green-economy benefits .
while CO2 can remain in the atmosphere for centuries , other pollutants , including black carbon and ozone , remain for relatively periods – days , weeks , months , or years – so that reducing or ending emissions promises almost immediate climate benefits .
the international community ’ s over-arching concern must be to seal a serious and significant deal at the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen in December to curtail C02 emissions and assist vulnerable countries to adapt . if the world also is to deploy all available means to combat climate change , emissions of all substances that contribute to it must be scientifically evaluated and urgently addressed .
the Centrists Cannot Hold
of course , the extent to which an electoral system favors large parties – by having high popular-vote thresholds to enter parliament , or through winner-take-all constituencies – affects the degree of political fragmentation . but , by and large , the developed democracies are characterized by competition between large parties on the center left and center right .
the British Liberal Democrats , for example , have tried for decades to become a strong centrist third party , without success . while the political vocabulary in the United States is different , the Democratic Party , since Franklin Roosevelt ’ s presidency , is indeed a center-left force , the Republican Party occupies the right , and no other significant party exists .
politics is still dominated by a large center-left party and a large center-right party , but smaller groups – some claiming the center and others the right and left extremes – challenge them to various degrees . in some countries , the “ Greens ” have their own identity , close to the left ; but , despite remarkable progress in Germany , they remain unable to reach the electoral size of the large center-right and center-left parties .
the situation is particularly interesting in Italy , where Monti , having decided to contest the upcoming general election , has had to position himself on the right ( which he signaled by attending a gathering of the leaders of Europe ’ s center-right parties ) . he and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi are now fighting for space on the right , with the center-left Democrats leading in the polls .
there are at least four differences between center-right and center-left approaches to social and economic challenges . the right has greater confidence in markets to allocate resources and provide appropriate incentives ; favors private consumption over public goods ; is minimally concerned with economic inequality ; and tends to be more nationalistic and less optimistic about international cooperation .
repeated financial crises have tempered even the right ’ s faith in unregulated markets , while the left has become more realistic and cautious about state planning and bureaucratic processes . likewise , the choice between privately consumed and publicly consumed “ goods ” is often blurred , as politicians tend to reinforce citizens ’ understandable tendency to demand public goods while rejecting the taxes needed to pay for them .
as income inequality has increased – dramatically in some countries , such as the US – it is moving to the forefront of the debate , reinforcing the traditional political divide . nonetheless , the center right and the center left are arguing about the degree of redistribution , not about the need for some progressivity in taxes and transfers .
so , given that differences in policies as they are implemented have become largely a matter of degree , why do centrist parties remain weak ? why have they failed to unite moderates on both sides of the ideological divide ?
active party members hold more ideologically consistent views – and hold them more strongly – than most of those who are politically less engaged , giving activists disproportionate influence in the political process . after all , more nuanced ideas and policy proposals are relatively difficult to propagate effectively enough to generate broad and enthusiastic popular support .
but there also really are fundamental differences in values and economic philosophies , as well as in economic interests , leading to a fairly consistent positioning of voters on the right or left . disagreement may lead to compromises , but that does not change the underlying differences in starting positions .
such parties can help to integrate the extremes into the political mainstream , while facilitating alternation in power , which is essential to any democracy ’ s dynamism ; a system in which a large centrist party remained permanently in power would be far less desirable . those , like Monti , who want to mount a challenge from the center , however personally impressive they may be , have steep obstacles to overcome , and for good reasons .
emerging-market Resilience
new YORK – With most of the world focused on economic instability and anemic growth in the advanced countries , developing countries , with the possible exception of China , have received relatively little attention . but , as a group , emerging-market economies have been negatively affected by the recent downturn in developed countries .
the major emerging economies were the world ’ s main growth engines following the eruption of the financial crisis in 2008 , and , to some extent , they still are . but their resilience has always been a function of their ability to generate enough incremental aggregate demand to support their growth , without having to make up for a large loss of demand in developed countries .
a combination of negligible ( or even negative ) growth in Europe and a significant growth slowdown in the United States has now created that loss , undermining emerging economies ’ exports . Europe is a major export destination for many developing countries , and is China ’ s largest foreign market .
moreover , not only is the tradable sector of Japan ’ s economy highly vulnerable to a slowdown in China , but the recent conflict over the Senkaku / Diaoyu Islands raises the prospect of economic decoupling . apart from that , Japanese economic performance is set to remain weak , because the non-tradable side is not a strong growth engine .
the key questions for the world economy today , then , are how significant the growth slowdown will be , and how long it will last . with wise policy responses , the impact is likely to be relatively mild and short-lived .
European banks , traditionally a major source of trade finance , have pulled back dramatically , owing to capital-adequacy problems caused by sovereign-debt capital losses and , in some cases , losses from real-estate lending . this vacuum could reduce trade flows even if demand were present .
in particular , although China ’ s tradable sector is highly exposed to developed economies , the government is likely to accept some short-run slowdown , rather than adopting potentially distorting stimulus measures . given the risk of re-inflating asset bubbles , no one should expect a dramatic easing of credit of the type that followed the 2008 meltdown .
an accelerated public-investment program that avoids low-return projects is not out of the question . but the best and most likely responses are those that accelerate domestic consumption growth by increasing household income , effectively deploy income from state-owned assets , and strengthen China ’ s social-security systems in order to reduce precautionary saving .
admittedly , China ’ s major systemic reforms await the country ’ s leadership transition , now expected in November . by most accounts , the pace of reform directed at expanding the market side of the economy needs to pick up quickly to achieve the ambitious economic and social goals of the next five years .
some countries have bucked the global trend . Indonesia , for example , has experienced accelerating growth , with rising business and consumer confidence boosting investment to almost 33 % of GDP .
moreover , overall economic performance in Brazil masks an important fact : growth rates have been substantially higher among the country ’ s poorer citizens , and unemployment is declining . the aggregate growth rate does not capture this inclusiveness , and thus understates the pace of economic and social progress .
the main challenge for Brazil is to increase its investment rate from 18 % of GDP currently to closer to 25 % , thereby sustaining rapid growth and economic diversification . commodity dependence , even with the creation of considerable domestic value added , remains high .
economic-growth rates in other systemically large countries , including Turkey and Mexico , have risen as well , despite European and US headwinds . many African countries , too , are showing a broad pattern of sound macroeconomic fundamentals , durable growth acceleration , economic diversification , and investor confidence .
while growth slowed recently from very high rates – owing to a combination of exposure to developed-country weakness , internal loss of reform momentum , and declining investor confidence – that trend appears to be reversing after recent decisive corrective moves by the government . the main question is whether India ’ s parliament will pass crucial legislation or remain paralyzed by hyper-partisan , scandal-fueled infighting .
combining this general picture with more general developing-country trends – rising incomes , rapid growth in middle classes , expanding trade and investment flows , bilateral and regional free-trade agreements , and a growing share of global GDP ( roughly 50 % ) – these economies ’ growth momentum should return relatively rapidly , over the next 1-2 years .
on balance , then , the multispeed growth patterns of the past decade are likely to continue . even as the developed economies experience an extended period of below-trend growth , the emerging economies will remain an important growth engine .
why Did Economists Not Foresee the Crisis ?
Chicago – At the height of the financial crisis , the Queen of England asked my friends at the London School of Economics a simple question , but one for which there is no easy answer : why did academic economists fail to foresee the crisis ?
one is that economists lacked models that could account for the behavior that led to the crisis . another is that economists were blinkered by an ideology according to which a free and unfettered market could do no wrong .
in my view , the truth lies elsewhere .
if you believe that the crisis was caused by a shortage of liquidity , we had plenty of models analyzing liquidity shortages and their effects on financial institutions . if you believe that the blame lies with greedy bankers and unthinking investors , lulled by the promise of a government bailout , or with a market driven crazy by irrational exuberance , we had studied all this too , in great detail .
economists even analyzed the political economy of regulation and deregulation , so we could have understood why some US politicians pushed the private sector into financing affordable housing , while others deregulated private finance . yet , somehow , we did not bring all this understanding to bear and collectively shout our warnings .
the dominant “ efficient markets theory ” says only that markets reflect what is publicly known , and that it is hard to make money off markets consistently – something verified by the hit that most investor portfolios took in the crisis . the theory does not say that markets cannot plummet if the news is bad , or if investors become risk-averse .
we cannot point to a lonely Cassandra like Robert Shiller of Yale University , who regularly argued that house prices were unsustainable , as proof that the truth was ignored . there are always naysayers , and they are often wrong .
but there is a better reason to be skeptical of explanations relying on ideology . as a group , neither behavioral economists , who think that market efficiency is a joke , nor progressive economists , who distrust free markets , predicted the crisis .
the bias could be implicit : our worldview is shaped by what our friends in industry believe . or it may be an explicit bias : an economist might write a report that is influenced by what a sponsor wants to hear , or give testimony that is purely mercenary .
but if economists were confined to the ivory tower , we might be unbiased , but we would also be ignorant of practicalities – and thus even less capable of predicting problems . one way to restore trust may be disclosure – for economists to declare a monetary interest in a particular analysis and , more generally , to explain who pays us .
but I believe that corruption is not the main reason that the profession missed the crisis . most economists have very little interaction with the corporate world , and these “ unbiased ” economists were no better at forecasting the crisis .
I would argue that three factors largely explain our collective failure : specialization , the difficulty of forecasting , and the disengagement of much of the profession from the real world .
like medicine , economics has become highly compartmentalized – macroeconomists typically do not pay attention to what financial economists or real-estate economists study , and vice versa . yet , to see the crisis coming would have required someone who knew about each of these areas – just as it takes a good general practitioner to recognize an exotic disease .
what is hardest to forecast , though , are turning points – when the old relationships break down . while there may be some factors that signal turning points – a run-up in short-term leverage and asset prices , for example , often presages a bust – they are not infallible predictors of trouble to come .
the meager professional rewards for breadth , coupled with the inaccuracy and reputational risk associated with forecasting , leads to disengagement for most academics . and it may well be that academic economists have little to say about short-term economic movements , so that forecasting , with all its errors , is best left to professional forecasters .
the danger is that disengagement from short-term developments leads academic economists to ignore medium-term trends that they can address . if so , the true reason why academics missed the crisis could be far more mundane than inadequate models , ideological blindness , or corruption , and thus far more worrisome ; many simply were not paying attention !
Malala ’ s Revolution
Islamabad – The men who attempted to kill 14-year-old Malala Yousafzai on October 9 knew what she represented . her active involvement since the age of eleven in campaigning for the rights of girls in her region to be educated was well known .
education , particularly of women , stands in the way of achieving this goal . but the attack on Malala will , most likely , have an effect that is opposite to that intended by those who carried it out .
several religious leaders joined the chorus of condemnation that followed the attack on Malala . in a sign of unity , a council of Sunni Muslim scholars in the eastern city of Lahore issued a fatwa , signed by 50 clerics , saying that the justifications cited by the girl ’ s attackers were “ deviant ” and had no basis in Islamic law .
Dawn , Pakistan ’ s largest-circulation English-language newspaper , reported that Hakimullah Mehsud , the Pakistani Taliban ’ s leader , had ordered his foot soldiers to target media organizations in Karachi , Lahore , Rawalpindi , and Islamabad in response . several TV channels had been extremely critical of the Taliban ’ s assaults on Pakistani society .
but male education and literacy in Pakistan is not very high , either . although Pakistan is a signatory to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals , which include attainment of universal literacy for both boys and girls by 2015 , the country is far from achieving the target , with literacy rates of 70 % for boys and only 45 % for girls in 2010 .
that said , over the 17-year period from 1993 to 2010 , the number of girls enrolled in primary education increased from 3.7 million to 8.3 million . this implies a rate of growth of 6.7 % a year , about 2.5 times the rate of increase in the number of girls entering the primary-school age cohort .
their share of total college enrollment has increased from 36 % to 57 % over the last couple of decades , rising from less than 15,000 in 1993 to 436,000 in 2010 . the proportion of women receiving higher education is approaching the 60 % mark , owing to an impressive 28 % annual rate of growth in their enrollment numbers in 2010 , up from a 20 % increase in 1993 .
this year , roughly 750,000 women will graduate from Pakistan ’ s institutions of higher learning . if the current rate of growth is maintained , by 2015 the number of women completing higher education could exceed 1.5 million a year .
had Malala died , she eventually would have been forgotten – another victim of the war that the extremists are waging in Pakistan . her death would have added just one more individual to the tens of thousands who have already been killed in terrorist attacks across the country .
she will begin to be identified with the change that is already underway . it is not often recognized that women in Pakistan – at least those of a certain class – are receiving the kind of education that enables them to enter the modern sectors of the economy or to become entrepreneurs .
a Talking Cure for Syria
while it will be difficult to get all of the relevant parties to the table in Geneva any time soon , much less to ensure an outcome that will stick , diplomacy is the only game left . as much as one might wish otherwise , every other policy option canvassed so far is wrong in principle , nonviable in practice , unlikely to be effective , or bound to increase rather than diminish suffering .
according to current United Nations estimates , more than 80,000 Syrians are dead , and 6.8 million – one-third of the country ’ s population – need urgent humanitarian assistance . some 4.25 million are displaced internally , and more than 1.5 million have fled the country , sheltering as refugees mainly in Lebanon , Jordan , and Turkey .
the strain on Syria ’ s neighbors is immense , and the conflict is inexorably seeping into the wider region . both government and rebel forces have committed atrocity crimes .
continued international paralysis is indefensible . inaction would ignite fires throughout the Middle East , and would violate the international community ’ s now-accepted responsibility to protect , through timely and decisive collective action , populations at risk of genocide , ethnic cleansing , and other major crimes against humanity and war crimes .
that principle , unanimously agreed by the UN General Assembly in 2005 , has been successfully invoked elsewhere , including in support of diplomatic intervention in Kenya in 2008 . it also underpinned Security Council-mandated military interventions in Libya and Cote d ’ Ivoire in 2011 and , more recently , in Mali .
the most immediate need , about which there should be little controversy , is massive humanitarian assistance . delivery problems abound in the war zones , but not everywhere .
it is too late now for non-military tools of coercion to have much effect , although Security Council threats of International Criminal Court prosecution for atrocity crimes – including any use of chemical weapons – must remain on the table . but what of the military-response options still strongly favored by many policymakers and pundits ?
with most of the country now ablaze , this argument is less convincing . but it remains the case that there are no obvious takers for a military role , partly because of the scale , difficulty , and risk of the commitment required , and partly because of the likely political and legal costs , given the minimal prospect of Security Council endorsement .
the United Kingdom and France are pressing hard for indirect military intervention : supplying arms to the rebel side , in their view , would be a low-cost , low-risk , potentially high-return option . and the European Union has now lifted its ban .
more broadly , increases in the supply of weapons funneled to rebel forces by Qatar , Saudi Arabia , and others have correlated with surges in the civilian death toll , suggesting that they cost more lives than they save – and with no evident strategic gains . the Assad regime , with its own external supporters , seems likely to have no difficulty matching any new hardware thrown at it .
if the rationale for arming the opposition is not so much to win the war as to weaken the government ’ s resistance to negotiation , it is arguable that the elements of a “ hurting stalemate ” are already in place , with more weapons likely to produce nothing but more fighting and more casualties . the pressure that has always mattered most for the Assad regime is that capable of being applied by Russia .
what is new , and encouraging , about the events of the last month is that Russia has found enough common ground with the US – in their mutual anxiety about the rising influence of radical Islam in an increasingly fragmented and volatile region – to be prepared at last to do some squeezing .
painful concessions will be required from both sides if the Geneva conference is even to convene , let alone reach agreement on a cease-fire and transitional administration . it is encouraging that the US , following talks between Secretary of State John Kerry and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , seems prepared to accept a role for senior Assad regime members in any settlement , and that constructive proposals are starting to emerge from at least some opposition quarters .
compromise can be anathema for purists , but it has always been the stuff of which peace is made . it has never been more necessary than it is now in Syria .
the Limits of Twitter Diplomacy
with so many international problems today , diplomacy does need to combine the old-fashioned statecraft of the twentieth century with the new tools that budding technologies have provided . but tools alone cannot solve or build anything .
it is hard to find a US ambassador in any part of the world who has not embraced the challenge of mastering these communication technologies . most have a Twitter or Facebook account , or post frequently on YouTube , in order to keep the public in the countries where they serve ( and at home ) informed of their daily activities , or occasionally their thinking about an issue or even their mood .
this generation of American diplomats is fast overcoming a reputation for being remote , emotionally distant figures . to be fair , in the past , an ambassador had few opportunities to connect with the host country ’ s population , apart from the occasional newspaper or television interview , or a photo of a meeting with a host country official or waiting on an airport ’ s tarmac for a visitor from Washington , DC .
most US embassies ensure a constant stream of tweets by relying on public-diplomacy officers to get the word out about what the ambassador is doing day by day , even hour by hour . many ambassadors have built mass followings in electronic terms , and generate numerous “ likes ” as they go about their daily routines of meetings and ribbon cuttings .
if so , why are there so many unmitigated and unmediated crises around the world – Syria ’ s civil war , the carnage in Egypt , and deteriorating US-Russian relations , to name just a few . the much-ballyhooed twenty-first-century statecraft , it seems , is really not up to the job .
advocates accurately point out that social media are a tool that is ignored at one ’ s peril . but what is urgently needed today is an understanding that diplomacy is not only about shouting from the rooftops and communicating with the general public .
maybe they shouldn ’ t be in power ; maybe the people demonstrating in the streets should be . but , in the here and now , these relationships need to be maintained in order to help polarized societies make progress toward overcoming their divisions .
that is the hot seat where American diplomacy belongs . with all due respect to “ eDiplomacy , ” this type of private , traditional communication remains the heart and soul of the business .
similarly , Secretary of State John Kerry has launched a courageous effort to revive the Israel-Palestine peace process . given the dearth of public information about his strategy , it is clear that he is not an avid practitioner of twenty-first-century statecraft – that is , he does not think out loud .
it is perhaps a little unfair to contrast these efforts to what the US did in Syria . in an effort to stay ahead of intense media expectations ( and reflecting a misunderstanding according to which Syria would be just another Tunisia ) , President Barack Obama ’ s administration essentially severed America ’ s relationship with Bashar al-Assad ’ s regime by publicly embracing the disparate opposition and calling for Assad ’ s immediate removal .
the US did not offer any clear indication of what it thought should follow such an outcome , apart from some kind of election process , which in a largely sectarian conflict like Syria ’ s would amount to nothing more than an elaborate census . lo and behold , political leaders , especially tough and terrible ones like Assad , tend not to embrace a process whose stated purpose is to eliminate them .
US diplomats – indeed , all countries ’ diplomats – might want to consider that , rather than chasing record numbers of social media “ followers , ” they should be building trust on all sides in conflict-prone societies and looking for more leaders willing to take chances for peace .
why Do Economies Stop Growing ?
Milan – Over the years , advanced and developing countries have experimented , sometimes deliberately and frequently inadvertently , with a variety of approaches to growth . unfortunately , many of these strategies have turned out to have built-in limitations or decelerators – what one might call elements of unsustainability .
here are some of the items in a growing library of decelerating growth models .
in developing countries , import substitution as a way to jump-start economic diversification can work for a while ; but , over time , as productivity growth lags and comparative advantage is over-ridden , growth grinds to a halt .
but , in terms of growth and living standards , the cost of economic diversification , when implemented by protecting domestic industries from foreign competition , eventually outweighs the benefits . it is better to allow specialization , and build effective social safety nets and support systems to protect people and families during economic transitions .
if invested in infrastructure , education , and external financial assets , natural-resource revenues can accelerate growth . but , too often , such revenues distort economic incentives , which come to favor rent-seeking and interfere with the diversification that is essential for growth .
this approach appears to work until domestic aggregate demand can no longer sustain growth and employment , at which point it ends in either gradual stagnation or a violent financial and economic crisis . ( in fact , many developing countries have learned this the hard way , but the lessons seem not to have crossed over to advanced countries . )
but the opposite of the excessive-consumption model – excessive reliance on investment to generate aggregate demand – is also a self-limiting growth pattern . when the private and social returns of investment diminish too much , growth cannot be sustained indefinitely , even though rising investment rates can sustain aggregate demand for a while .
while people in a wide range of countries accept some degree of market-determined income variation , based on differential talents and personal preferences , there are limits . when they are breached , the typical result is a sense of unfairness , followed by resistance and , ultimately , political choices that address the inequality , though sometimes in counter-productive , growth-impeding ways .
perhaps the largest long-run sustainability issue concerns the adequacy of the global economy ’ s natural-resource base : output will more than triple over the coming two or three decades , as high-growth developing economies ’ four billion people converge toward advanced-country income levels and consumption patterns . existing economic-development strategies will require significant adaption to accommodate this kind of growth .
some adaptation will occur naturally , as rising energy and other commodity prices generate incentives to economize or seek alternatives . but the un-priced environmental externalities – global warming and water depletion , for example – will require serious attention , not myopic , reactive mindsets and approaches . &amp; nbsp ;
first , in one or several dimensions , some part of the economy ’ s base of tangible , intangible , and natural-resource assets is being run down . I would include social cohesion as part of the asset base : it is the one that is depreciated by excessive inequality .
it is easier to run down something that is partly invisible because it is not regularly or effectively measured . expanded measurement of the dimensions of economic , social , and environmental performance is necessary to broaden awareness of sustainability issues . &amp; nbsp ;
after all , past investment shortfalls have to be made up and future-oriented investments undertaken simultaneously – a double burden that must be borne by the current generation . an inability to resolve the distributional and fairness problem can produce gridlock , paralysis , and prolonged stagnation .
contrary to the prevailing wisdom nowadays , some degree of Keynesian demand management in the transition to a more sustainable growth pattern is not in conflict with restoring fiscal balance over a sensible time period . on the contrary , applied both individually and together , fiscal stimulus and consolidation are necessary parts of the adjustment process .
but they are not sufficient . the crucial missing pieces are a shift in the structure of accessible aggregate demand and restoration of those parts of the economy ’ s asset base that have been run down , implying the need for structural change and investment .
why Does Angela Merkel Hesitate ?
Munich – “ Where is Angela ? ” is the question The Economist asked when Nicolas Sarkozy , Gordon Brown , and José Manuel Barroso met to prepare a European economic stimulus plan without Chancellor Merkel being present . indeed , Germany is currently the spoiler in the competition to provide billions to prevent a breakdown of the world economy .
whereas Keynesian theory has largely disappeared from economic textbooks in the United States , it continues to be taught everywhere in Germany . German economists , in contrast to their American colleagues , never abandoned Keynesian policies as a means to combat demand deficits .
Germany did not have a real-estate bubble that threatened to burst , as did Great Britain , Ireland , Spain , and France . Germany has only been indirectly affected – by the decline in worldwide demand for German products – which explains an important timing difference in the business cycle .
whereas unemployment in the US has been rising for one and a half years , Germany currently is enjoying its lowest unemployment rate in 16 years . the German construction industry and retailing are still stable , as the latest survey of the Ifo Institute shows , and the whole world is profiting from this stability , as Germany is the second largest importer of goods and services after the US .
the Ifo Institute has forecast that GDP will contract by 2.2 % in 2009 . but the contraction will be primarily because of declining exports , a large portion of which consists of investment goods , as well as the drop in domestic equipment investment .
these are areas where there is not much that the state can do to help . it can cut taxes to stimulate consumption and it can invest in construction , but these sectors currently need little help , except perhaps for the automobile industry .
he is right in principle in demanding a major economic stimulus package from the German government that goes beyond the € 35 billion already planned . but he should not ignore the time lags between the American and the German economic cycles .
when Sarkozy and other EU leaders demand Germany ’ s participation in an economic stimulus and rescue package , one reason is that they expect Germany to again bear the lion ’ s share of the costs . for example , of the € 5 billion extension of the Cohesion Funds approved by the European Parliament in December 2007 , Germany received nothing , but it bears 20 % of the costs .
Germans have always been enthusiastic proponents of the EU , not least because they hoped that a European identity would help compensate for their damaged national identity . so , whenever it came to restructuring the EU , they always accepted a level of influence that was small relative to their country ’ s size .
after all , aside from political under-representation , Germany ’ s annual contribution to the EU budget ( most recently € 7.4 billion ) makes the country by far the largest net contributor . Germany finances 20 % of the EU budget but receives only 12 % of EU spending .
Sarkozy regards an EU economic government as a way to preserve his leadership in the EU beyond France ’ s Council presidency , which is now ending . although the Czech Republic will assume the EU presidency in January , this has not prevented the French President from convening a new EU summit under Sarkozy ’ s leadership in the first half of 2009 .
this affront will put not only Czech tolerance to the test , but also that of Merkel . in the end , she will probably give in to Sarkozy ’ s wishes in order to avoid endangering her chances of re-election in September because of a conflict with the French .
why Do Smart People Live Longer ?
Edinburgh – People with higher intelligence test scores in childhood and early adulthood tend to live longer . this result has been found among people from Australia , Denmark , England and Wales , Scotland , Sweden , and the United States .
indeed , the impact of intelligence on mortality rivals well-known risk factors for illness and death , such as high blood pressure , being overweight , high blood glucose , and high cholesterol . its effect is almost as important as that of smoking .
an intelligence test score in early life is partly a record of what the environment has wrought on the brain and the rest of the body up to that time . babies who have lower birth weights , for example , are more prone to chronic illnesses later in life .
parents ’ occupations are also related to their child ’ s intelligence and later risk of illness : children from more privileged backgrounds tend to have higher intelligence and better health , and to live longer . however , there is no convincing evidence that parental background explains the link between higher intelligence and longer life .
other researchers have viewed intelligence test scores as possibly more than just an indicator of an efficient brain . after all , the brain is just one organ of the body , so people whose brains work well in early life may also have other organs and systems that are more efficient than others ’ .
Reaction-time tests involve little thinking , and merely ask people to respond as fast as they can to simple stimuli . people who react faster have , on average , higher intelligence scores and live longer .
a third potential explanation is that intelligence is about good decision-making . every day , as we live our lives , we make decisions about our health : what , when , and how much to eat ; how much exercise to take ; how to look after ourselves if we have an illness ; and so forth .
therefore , the reason that intelligence and death are linked might be that people with higher intelligence in childhood make better decisions about health , and have healthier behaviors . as adults , they tend to have better diets , exercise more , gain less weight , have fewer hangovers , and so on .
there have not been any studies with data on childhood intelligence , lots of subsequent data on adult health behaviors , and then a long-term follow-up for deaths . and only such a study could tell us whether it is these healthy behaviors that explain the link between intelligence and death .
a fourth type of explanation is that people with higher intelligence in childhood tend to attain better educational qualifications , work in more professional jobs , have higher incomes , and live in more affluent areas . these variables are related to living longer , too .
the problem is that this “ explanation ” is statistical . we are still not sure whether , say , education and occupation “ explain ” the effect of intelligence on health , or whether they are , in effect , merely surrogate measures of intelligence .
lower intelligence in early life is associated with a greater likelihood of dying from , for example , cardiovascular disease , accidents , suicide , and homicide . the evidence for cancer is less certain .
finally , we know that how intelligent we are and how long we shall live are caused by both environmental and genetic influences . there are experimental designs , using twins , that can find out the extent to which intelligence and mortality are linked because they share environmental and genetic influences .
among the most informative exercises we can undertake in cognitive epidemiology is to obtain a large group of twins on whom there is data on early-life intelligence and who were tracked for a long time to find out who had died . we haven ’ t yet come across a large enough group of twins with such data .
the ultimate aim of this research is to find out what intelligent people have and do that enables them to live longer . once we know that , we will be able to share and apply that knowledge with the aim of achieving optimal health for all .
growth Out of Time
Cambridge – Robert Gordon of Northwestern University is a distinguished economist whose work in macroeconomics and studies of long-term economic growth have properly earned him high regard . so his recent exercise in speculative future history , which asks whether economic growth in the United States has come to an end , has attracted much favorable attention .
the vulnerability of Gordon ’ s argument is his shortened time horizon for IR # 3 . consider the following four sentences in his paper :
· &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; “ Both the first two revolutions required about 100 years for their full effects to percolate through the economy . ”

in 1873 , the retailer Montgomery Ward was just a year old , and the first Sears Roebuck catalogue was still 20 years away . together , these companies invented mail order as the “ killer app ” of the railroad age , creating a continental market for consumer goods , with all of the economies of scale that followed .
or , to take another example , what if we stopped measuring the economic impact of electrification only 45 years after the first generating plant , Thomas Edison ’ s Pearl Street Station , became operational in 1882 ? at that point , America ’ s manufacturing industries were just discovering the benefits of flexible ( re ) configuration , which enabled distribution of generated electric power , while America ’ s home-appliance industry was in its infancy .
innovation in information and communications technology ( ICT ) focused first on electronic commerce , “ itself largely completed by 2005 . ” After that , “ labor-saving innovation ” took a back seat to “ a succession of entertainment and communication devices that do the same things as we could do before , but now in smaller and more convenient packages . ”
in the US , the most advanced country in this respect , e-commerce has just reached 10 % of total retail spending , and is continuing to grow at double-digit rates through the slow recovery from the Great Recession . at the same time , something much more significant is happening beneath the economic surface .
from the early days of the computer revolution , researchers and popularizers envisioned “ artificial intelligence ” as the ultimate killer app ( literally , in the case of the computer HAL in the film 2001 : a Space Odyssey ) . decades of frustration are now yielding to success : the application of sophisticated statistical techniques to the accelerating accumulation of unprecedented quantities of so-called Big Data that the Internet simultaneously generates and captures .
the next wave of IR # 3 ’ s consequences can be discerned in systems that capture the intention behind a search request and couple it to a completed transaction , and in the application of predictive analytics to industrial supply chains and service provisioning . if these innovations ’ prospective impact on productivity and GDP growth cannot be quantified , well , that is the way it is with future history .
of the assorted “ headwinds ” that he cites , the enormous increase in inequality and the plateau reached in educational attainment represent threats that differentiate America ’ s position from that of other advanced countries . but Gordon ignores the greatest threat to continued US global leadership in innovation : the delegitimation over the past generation of the state ’ s role as an economic actor .
the only reference to government in his paper is not even to this stabilizing role . rather , it is to the asserted headwind represented by the very debt incurred to prevent the global financial crisis of 2008 from triggering a second Great Depression .
the Truth About Sovereignty
Cambridge – In the French parliament ’ s recent debate on Europe ’ s new fiscal treaty , the country ’ s Socialist government vehemently denied that ratification of the treaty would undermine French sovereignty . it places “ not one constraint on the level of public spending , ” Jean-Marc Ayrault , the prime minister , asserted .
as Ayrault was trying to reassure his skeptical colleagues , including many members of his own party , European Commissioner for Competition Joaquin Almunia was delivering a similar message to his fellow social democrats in Brussels . to succeed , he argued , Europe must prove wrong those who believe there is a conflict between globalization and sovereignty .
nobody likes to give up national sovereignty , least of all , it seems , politicians on the left . yet , by denying the obvious fact that the eurozone ’ s viability depends on substantial restraints on sovereignty , Europe ’ s leaders are misleading their voters , delaying the Europeanization of democratic politics , and raising the political and economic costs of the ultimate reckoning .
but it also requires that they harmonize their domestic rules and regulations – &amp; nbsp ; such as product-safety standards and bank regulations – with those of other member states in order to ensure they do not act as indirect trade barriers . and governments must forswear changes in these policies , lest the uncertainty itself act as a transaction cost .
this was all implicit in the European Union ’ s single-market initiative . the eurozone went one step further , aiming through monetary unification to eradicate fully the transaction costs associated with national currencies and exchange-rate risk .
if its future is now in doubt , it is because sovereignty stands in the way once again . in a true economic union , underpinned by union-wide political institutions , the financial problems of Greece , Spain , and the others would not have blown up to their current proportions , threatening the existence of the union itself .
consider the United States . no one even keeps track of , say , Florida ’ s current-account deficit with the rest of the country , although we can safely guess that it is huge ( since the state is home to many retirees living off benefits that come from elsewhere ) .
when Florida ’ s state government goes bankrupt , Florida ’ s banks continue to operate normally , because they are under federal rather than state jurisdiction . when Florida ’ s banks go belly-up , state finances are insulated , because the banks are ultimately the responsibility of federal institutions .
when Florida ’ s workers become unemployed , they get unemployment checks from Washington , DC . and when Florida ’ s voters are disenchanted about the economy , they do not riot outside the state capital ; they put pressure on their representatives in Congress to push for changes in federal policies .
political scientists talk about “ democratic delegation ” – the idea that a sovereign might want to tie its hands ( through international commitments or delegation to autonomous agencies ) in order to achieve better outcomes . the delegation of monetary policy to an independent central bank is the archetypal example : in the service of price stability , daily management of monetary policy is insulated from politics .
even if selective limitations on sovereignty may enhance democratic performance , there is no guarantee that all limitations implied by market integration would do so . in domestic politics , delegation is carefully calibrated and restricted to a few areas where the issues tend to be highly technical and partisan differences are not large .
a truly democracy-enhancing globalization would respect these boundaries . it would impose only those limits that are consistent with democratic delegation , possibly along with a limited number of procedural norms ( such as transparency , accountability , representativeness , use of scientific evidence , etc . ) that enhance democratic deliberation at home .
as the American example illustrates , it is possible to give up on sovereignty – &amp; nbsp ; as Florida , Texas , California , and the other US states have done – &amp; nbsp ; without giving up on democracy . but combining market integration with democracy requires the creation of supranational political institutions that are representative and accountable .
the conflict between democracy and globalization becomes acute when globalization restricts the domestic articulation of policy preferences without a compensating expansion of democratic space at the regional / global level . Europe is already on the wrong side of this boundary , as the political unrest in Spain and Greece indicates .
that is where my political trilemma begins to bite : we cannot have globalization , democracy , and national sovereignty simultaneously . we must choose two among the three .
the first would entail coming clean with their own electorates and building democratic space above the level of the nation-state . the second would mean giving up on monetary union in order to be able to deploy national monetary and fiscal policies in the service of longer-term recovery .
the longer this choice is postponed , the greater the economic and political cost that ultimately will have to be paid .
economic Policy ’ s Narrative Imperative
Washington , DC – The best advice I received when taking up policymaking responsibilities in Turkey more than a decade ago was to take “ a lot of time and care to develop and communicate the ‘ narrative ’ to support the policy program that you want to succeed . ” The more that economic policy is subject to public debate – that is , the more democracy there is – the more important such policy narratives are .
the crisis faced by the European Union and the eurozone is a telling example of the need for a narrative that explains public policy and generates political support for it . a successful narrative can be neither too complicated nor simplistic .
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi provided such a narrative to the financial markets last July . he said that the ECB would do everything necessary to prevent the disintegration of the euro , adding simply : “ Believe me , it will be enough . ”
with that sentence , Draghi eliminated the perceived re-denomination tail risk that was highest in the case of Greece , but that was driving up borrowing costs in Spain , Italy , and Portugal as well . it was not a populist message , because the ECB does indeed have the firepower to buy enough sovereign bonds on the secondary market to put a ceiling on interest rates , at least for many months .
central bankers , more generally , are typically able to provide short- or medium-term narratives to financial markets . US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke provided his own by pledging that US short-term interest rates would remain very low , and the Bank of Japan ’ s new chairman , Haruhiko Kuroda , has just provided another by saying that he will double the money supply so that inflation reaches 2 % .
while central bankers can provide such narratives to financial markets , it is political leaders who must provide the overall socioeconomic messages that encourage long-term real investment , electoral support for reform , and hope for the future . central bank alchemy , to borrow a term from the US journalist Neil Irwin ’ s new book , has its limits .
France is coming closer to the danger zone , and even Germany ’ s annual GDP growth is falling well below 1 % per year . in the meantime , the easing of sovereign interest-rate spreads provides little comfort to the growing army of unemployed in southern Europe , where youth unemployment has reached dramatic heights – close to 60 % in Greece and Spain , and almost 40 % in Italy .
how can economic growth be revived and sustained throughout the EU ? and how can Europe ’ s institutions function with enhanced legitimacy to accommodate countries that share the euro and others that retain their national currencies ?
for starters , a revolution is required in the organization of work , learning , and leisure . social solidarity , essential to European identity , can and must include longer work lives , but also more work-sharing , adult learning , and shorter average work weeks ( particularly close to retirement ) .
this can lead to a better future for all , with citizens gaining better access to adult education , having more free time to pursue personal interests , and remaining productive and occupationally engaged far longer into their healthy lives .
it can secure decent jobs and prosperity , with a sustained annual growth rate of around 2 % . to achieve that , German voters should be told not that their country ’ s resources will forever flow to Spain , but that their wages can rise at twice the rate of the recent past without risking inflation or a current-account deficit , because Germany has the world ’ s largest external surplus .
service-sector industries throughout the EU must be opened up . the countries with stronger fiscal positions should take the lead in a major pan-European skill-upgrading program .
finally , while monetary union obviously requires greater sharing of sovereignty , there should also be a “ greater Europe ” that includes the United Kingdom and others . this implies two-tier institutions that can accommodate both types of countries : the “ euro-ins ” and those that prefer to preserve their monetary sovereignty in a larger Europe built around a vibrant single market and common democratic values .
these interconnected visions can and must be realized if Europe is to thrive again . together , they form a compelling narrative that European leaders must begin to articulate .
why Eurobonds are Un-American
first , taking over a stock of existing state debt at the federal level is very different from allowing individual member states to issue bonds with “ joint and several ” liability underwritten by all member states collectively . Hamilton did not have to worry about moral hazard , because the federal government did not guarantee any new debt incurred by the states .
second , it is seldom mentioned that US federal debt at the time ( around $ 40 million ) was much larger than that of the states ( about $ 18 million ) . thus , assuming state debt was not central to the success of post-war financial stabilization in the new country ; rather , it was a natural corollary of the fact that most of the debt had been incurred fighting for a common cause .
moreover , the most efficient sources of government revenues at the time were tariffs and taxes collected at the external border . even from an efficiency point of view , it made sense to have the federal government service public debt .
Federal assumption of the states ’ war debts also yielded an advantage in terms of economic development : once states no longer had any debt , they had no need to raise any revenues through direct taxation , which might have impeded the growth of America ’ s internal market . indeed , after the federal government assumed the states ’ debt ( already a small part of the total ) , state revenues fell by 80-90 % .
finally , the key to the success of financial stabilization was a profound restructuring . Hamilton estimated that the federal government could raise enough revenues to pay approximately 4 % interest on the total amount of debt to be serviced – significantly less than the 6 % yield on the existing obligations .
holders of both state and federal bonds were thus offered a basket of long-dated bonds , some with an interest rate of 3 % , and others with 6 % ( with a ten-year grace period ) . the basket was designed in such a way as to result in an average debt-service cost of 4 % .
moreover , the new federal bonds ’ very long maturities meant that there was no rollover risk . it would have been very dangerous to expose the federal government to this danger , given that the operation was rightly perceived at the outset as extremely risky .
the slightest negative shock could have bankrupted the new federal government . fortunately , the opposite happened : Federal revenues tripled under the impact of a rapid post-war reconstruction boom , and continued to grow rapidly , aided by the country ’ s ability to remain neutral while wars ravaged the European continent .
by contrast , growth prospects in Europe today are rather dim , and interest payments , even for Greece or Italy , account for less than 20 % of total revenues . the real problem is the rollover of existing debt in a stagnating economy .
assuaging doubt about the sustainability of public debt in the eurozone would thus probably require a deep restructuring as well . the eurozone crisis could certainly be resolved if all existing public debt were transformed into 20-year Eurobonds with a yield of 3 % , and a five-year grace period on debt service .
in the 1830 ’ s and 1840 ’ s , a number of states had over-invested in the leading transport technology of the time – &amp; nbsp ; canals . when the canal-building boom ended , eight states and the Territory of Florida ( accounting for about 10 % of the entire US population at the time ) were unable to service their debt and defaulted on their , mostly British , loans .
British bankers threatened that they would never again invest in these untrustworthy Americans . they could point to the precedent set by Hamilton , and had probably invested on the implicit understanding that , if necessary , the federal government would bail out the states again .
but , despite foreign creditors ’ threats , the federal government did not come to the rescue . the bailout request did not succeed because it could not muster a simple majority of the states ( represented by the Senate ) and the population ( represented by the House of Representatives ) under the normal decision-making procedure ( the “ Community method , ” in European Union jargon ) .
the 1840 ’ s were a period of slow growth , and continued pressure from foreign creditors forced most of the official debtors to resume payments after a while . default was not an easy way out , and all US states ( with the exception of Vermont ) have since embraced balanced-budget amendments to their constitutions as a way to shore up their fiscal credibility .
why Fair Trade ?
in the United States , businesses and labor unions use “ fair trade ” laws to construct what economist Joseph Stiglitz calls “ barbed-wire barriers to imports . ” These so called “ anti-dumping ” laws allow a company that suspects a foreign rival of selling a product below cost to request that the government impose special tariffs to protect it from “ unfair ” competition .
such dark protectionist thoughts are far from the minds of the benevolent organizers of the United Kingdom ’ s annual “ Fairtrade Fortnight , ” during which I just bought two bars of fair-trade chocolate and a jar of fair-trade chunky peanut butter . their worthy aim is to raise the price paid to developing-country farmers for their produce by excluding the inflated profits of the middlemen on whom they depend for getting their goods to distant markets .
this certification enables supermarkets and other retailers to sell the products at a premium . Third-World farmers get a boost to their income , while first-world consumers get to feel virtuous : a marriage made in heaven .
in a notable breakthrough in 1997 , the British House of Commons decided to serve only fair-trade coffee . by the end of 2007 , more than 600 producers ’ organizations , representing 1.4 million farmers in 58 countries , were selling fair-trade products .
the economic rationale for guaranteed prices is well known : stabilizing the prices of primary products , which are subject to sharp fluctuations , stabilizes their producers ’ incomes . this argument inspired proposals – most famously by John Maynard Keynes in 1942 – to create “ buffer stocks ” for the main commodities , which would take supply off the market when prices fell , and add to supply when prices rose .
left-wing economists like Raúl Prebisch , moreover , later advanced the theory of “ declining terms of trade ” for primary products : their prices ’ long-run tendency to fall relative to the prices of manufactured goods . this tendency seemed to be at work from the mid-1980 ’ s , as commodity producers experienced a persistent decline in prices .
food commodity prices have increased by 150 % since 2001 . this has raised farm producers ’ income independently of the fair-trade movement ’ s efforts .
but primary-product prices remain much more volatile than the prices of manufactured goods and services , causing large fluctuations in producers ’ incomes . this exaggerates the effects of booms and busts .
it is difficult to see how the fair-trade movement can contribute much to solving this problem , because the only serious policy for stabilizing producers ’ incomes is to control supply . but that is beyond the scope of fair trade .
in Unfair Trade , a pamphlet published in 2008 by the Adam Smith Institute , Mark Sidwell argues that FAIRTRADE keeps uncompetitive farmers on the land , holding back diversification and mechanization . according to Sidwell , the FAIRTRADE scheme turns developing countries into low-profit , labor-intensive agrarian ghettos , denying future generations the chance of a better life .
this is without considering the effect that FAIRTRADE has on the poorest people in these countries – not farmers but casual laborers – who are excluded from the scheme by its expensive regulations and labor standards . in other words , FAIRTRADE protects farmers against their rivals and against agricultural laborers .
only a tiny proportion – as little as 1 % – of the premium that we pay for a FAIRTRADE chocolate bar will ever make it to cocoa producers . nor is FAIRTRADE necessarily a guarantee of quality : because producers get a minimum price for fair-trade goods , they sell the best of their crop on the open market .
while cynics say that its only achievement is to make consumers feel better about their purchases – rather like buying indulgences in the old Catholic Church – this is to sell fair trade short . in fact , the movement represents a spark of protest against mindless consumerism , grass-roots resistance against an impersonal logic , and an expression of communal activism .
that justification will not convince economists , who prefer a dryer sort of reasoning . but it is not out of place to remind ourselves that economists and bureaucrats need not always have things their own way .
is US Monetary Policy Made in China ?
Amsterdam – For much of the year , investors have been fixated on when the Fed will achieve “ liftoff ” – that is , when it will raise interest rates by 25 basis points , or 0.25 % , as a first step toward normalizing monetary conditions . markets have soared and plummeted in response to small changes in Fed statements perceived as affecting the likelihood that liftoff is imminent .
since mid-August , when Chinese policymakers startled the markets by devaluing the renminbi by 2 % , China ’ s official intervention in foreign-exchange markets has continued , in order to prevent the currency from falling further . the Chinese authorities have been selling foreign securities , mainly United States Treasury bonds , and buying up renminbi .
back then , China bought US Treasury bonds to keep the currency from rising and eroding the competitiveness of Chinese exporters . as a result , it accumulated an astounding $ 4 trillion of foreign reserves .
and what was true of China was also true of other emerging-market countries receiving capital inflows . these countries ’ foreign reserves , mainly held in US securities , topped $ 8 trillion at their peak last year .
in 2005 , US Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan pointed to the phenomenon as an explanation for his famous “ conundrum ” : interest rates on Treasury bonds were lower than market conditions appeared to warrant . his successor , Ben Bernanke , similarly pointed to purchases of US debt by foreign central banks and governments as a reason why American interest rates were so low .
although no one outside official Chinese circles knows the exact magnitude of China ’ s foreign-exchange intervention , informed guesses suggest that it has been running at roughly $ 100 billion a month since mid-August . observers believe that roughly 60 % of China ’ s liquid reserves are in US Treasury bills .
recall that the Fed began its third round of quantitative easing ( QE3 ) by purchasing $ 40 billion of securities a month , before boosting the volume to $ 85 billion . monthly sales of $ 60 billion by China ’ s government would lie squarely in the middle .
his estimates imply that foreign sales at a rate of $ 60 billion per month raise yields by ten basis points . given that China has been at it for 2.5 months , this implies that the equivalent of a 25-basis-point increase in interest rates has already been injected into the market .
some would object that the renminbi is weak because China is experiencing capital outflows by private investors , and that some of this private money also flows into US financial markets . this is technically correct , but it is already factored into the changes in interest rates described above .
it signals that the authorities are seriously committed to making the future different from the past . but if Chinese intervention is just a one-off event , and there are no expectations of it continuing , then this second channel shouldn ’ t be operative , and the impact will be smaller than that of QE .
from this standpoint , the Fed ’ s decision to wait to begin liftoff is eminently sensible . and , given that China holds ( and is therefore now selling ) euros as well , the European Central Bank also should bear this in mind when it decides in December whether to ramp up its own program of quantitative easing .
why Finance Can Save the Planet
Paris – Most people hate finance , viewing it as the epitome of irresponsibility and greed . but , even after causing a once-in-a-century recession and unemployment for millions , finance looks indispensable for preventing an even worse catastrophe : climate change .
action is urgently needed to contain global warming and prevent a disaster for humanity ; yet the global community is desperately short of tools . there is not much support for the most desirable solutions advocated by economists , such as a global cap on greenhouse-gas emissions , coupled with a trading system , or the enforcement of a worldwide carbon price through a global tax on CO2 emissions .
instead , negotiations for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December are being conducted on the basis of voluntary , unilateral pledges called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions . although the inclusion of voluntary targets has the merit of creating global momentum , this approach is unlikely to result in commitments that are both binding and commensurate to the challenge .
that is why climate advocates are increasingly looking for other means of triggering action . finance is at the top of their list .
for starters , finance provides an accurate yardstick to gauge if deeds are consistent with words . in 2011 , “ Unburnable Carbon , ” a path-breaking report by the nongovernmental Carbon Tracker Initiative , showed that the proven fossil-fuel reserves owned by governments and private companies exceed by a factor of five the quantity of carbon that can be burned in the next 50 years if global warming is to be kept below two degrees Celsius .
reserves held just by the 200 top publicly listed fuel companies – thus excluding state-owned producers such as Saudi Arabia ’ s Aramco – exceed this carbon budget by one-third . and that means that these companies ’ stock-market valuation is inconsistent with containing global warning .
furthermore , Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has highlighted the threat represented by potentially stranded carbon assets . investors are being warned that , from the standpoint of financial stability , “ brown ” securities bear specific risk .
yet $ 2.6 trillion amounts to less than 5 % of global private non-financial securities . the trend is real , but it is still too little to trigger significant changes in fossil-fuel companies ’ valuation and behavior .
green investment amounts to only 15 % of the total , and investment in energy efficiency – in buildings , transport , and industry – totals a meager $ 130 billion . containing the increase in average surface temperature to two degrees requires developing clean technologies , and even more important , a four-fold increase in investment in energy efficiency over the next ten years .
yet such investment will not be financed easily : its return depends on a still-elusive carbon price and will often materialize only in the long run , while improving energy efficiency implies replacing hundreds of millions of outdated vehicles and refitting hundreds of millions of energy-voracious buildings . adequate financing instruments are required for the right purpose at the right place and at the right scale .
development banks and green banks have a huge role to play . for example , dedicated long-term loans , coupled with a tax break or a subsidy , would help households decide to modernize their homes .
to elicit the investments that are necessary to mitigate climate change and green the economy , the elimination of fossil-fuel subsidies and a credible , fast-rising path for the price of carbon are vital . but , because high fuel prices are unpopular with consumers and raise competitiveness concerns among businesses , governments are reluctant to take action today – and may renege on their commitments to act tomorrow .
some have recommended that governments issue CO2 performance bonds , whose yield would be reduced if companies exceed their carbon target . another idea , put forward in a recent paper by Michel Aglietta and his colleagues , is to map out a path for an indicative price of carbon called its “ social value ” and provide green project developers a government-guaranteed carbon certificate representing the value of the corresponding emissions reduction .
if the price of carbon in , say , ten years , actually corresponds to the announced social value , the project will be profitable and the developer will repay the loan . but if the government reneges on its commitment , the developer will default , leaving the central bank with a claim on the government .
action against global warming would take place without delay . but a decade or so later , governments – and societies more broadly – would need to choose between taxation , debt , and inflation .
undertaking massive investment now and deciding only later how to finance it looks irresponsible – and so it is . but not acting at all would be even more irresponsible .
models Behaving Badly
Queen Elizabeth II asked economists during a visit to the London School of Economics at the end of 2008 . four years later , the repeated failure of economic forecasters to predict the depth and duration of the slump would have elicited a similar question from the queen : why the overestimate of recovery ?
in the United Kingdom , the 2010 forecast of the Office for Budget Responsibility ( OBR ) projected 2.6 % growth in 2011 and 2.8 % growth in 2012 ; in fact , the UK economy grew by 0.9 % in 2011 and will flat-line in 2012 . the OECD ’ s latest forecast for eurozone GDP in 2012 is 2.3 % lower than its projection in 2010 .
likewise , the IMF now predicts that the European economy will be 7.8 % smaller in 2015 than it thought just two years ago . some forecasters are more pessimistic than others ( the OBR has a particularly sunny disposition ) , but no one , it seems , has been pessimistic enough .
economic forecasting is necessarily imprecise : too many things happen for forecasters to be able to foresee all of them . so judgment calls and best guesses are an inevitable part of “ scientific ” economic forecasts .
indeed , the figures have been repeatedly revised , even over quite short periods of time , casting strong doubt on the validity of the economic models being used . these models , and the institutions using them , rely on a built-in theory of the economy , which enables them to “ assume ” certain relationships .
the models used by all of the forecasting organizations dramatically underestimated the fiscal multiplier : the impact of changes in government spending on output . second , they overestimated the extent to which quantitative easing ( QE ) by the monetary authorities – that is , printing money – could counterbalance fiscal tightening .
until recently , the OBR , broadly in line with the IMF , assumed a fiscal multiplier of 0.6 : for every dollar cut from government spending , the economy would shrink by only 60 cents . this assumes “ Ricardian equivalence ” : debt-financed public spending at least partly crowds out private spending through its impact on expectations and confidence .
on this view , if fiscal austerity relieves households of the burden of future tax increases , they will increase their spending . this may be true when the economy is operating at full employment – when state and market are in competition for every last resource .
the OBR , reviewing its recent mistakes , accepted that “ the average &#91; fiscal &#93; multiplier over the two years would have needed to be 1.3 – more than double our estimate – to fully explain the weak level of GDP in 2011-12 . ” The IMF has conceded that “ multipliers have actually been in the 0.9 and 1.7 range since the Great Recession . ”
forecasters assumed that monetary expansion would provide an effective antidote to fiscal contraction . the Bank of England hoped that by printing £ 375 billion of new money , ( $ 600 billion ) , it would stimulate total spending to the tune of £ 50 billion , or 3 % of GDP .
but the evidence emerging from successive rounds of QE in the UK and the US suggests that while it did lower bond yields , the extra money was largely retained within the banking system , and never reached the real economy . this implies that the problem has mainly been a lack of demand for credit – reluctance on the part of businesses and households to borrow on almost any terms in a flat market .
these two mistakes compounded each other : if the negative impact of austerity on economic growth is greater than was originally assumed , and the positive impact of quantitative easing is weaker , then the policy mix favored by practically all European governments has been hugely wrong . there is much greater scope for fiscal stimulus to boost growth , and much smaller scope for monetary stimulus .
all of these models assume outcomes on the basis of existing policies . their consistent over-optimism about these policies ’ impact on economic growth validates pursuing them , and enables governments to claim that their remedies are “ working , ” when they clearly are not .
this is a cruel deception . before they can do any good , the forecasters must go back to the drawing board , and ask themselves whether the theories of the economy underpinning their models are the right ones .
Hollande in Mali
Paris – While hundreds of thousands demonstrated in Paris against the right of homosexual couples to marry and adopt children , French troops were arriving in Mali to stop a coalition of Islamist and rebel forces from taking control of its capital , Bamako , and creating in the Sahel a sanctuary for terrorists .
these are trying times for French President François Hollande . besieged economically at home , where his popularity is at its lowest since his election last year , can he regain credibility , if not support , as supreme commander of French forces ?
once upon a time , “ I intervene , therefore I am ” might as well have been a French motto , particularly in Africa . but , while French national identity is intimately bound up with France ’ s international standing – how it is perceived in the world – enthusiasm for intervention has receded .
if France has again become a regional gendarme by default , it is largely for three reasons . American enthusiasm for intervention in Africa has greatly diminished since the operation in Somalia in 1992-1993 – and more globally following the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
while France is not alone – manifestations of support have come from its Western and African partners , as well as from the Middle East – it will bear the primary responsibility and the risks . for Islamic fundamentalists , France is now the “ Great Satan . ”
indeed , the conflict in Mali is taking place geographically in Africa , but in many ways its causes and ramifications lie in the Middle East . when France intervened in an African country in the past , there was no risk of terrorist attacks on its territory or on its citizens elsewhere in the world .
they would have criticized him had he remained passive while Bamako fell into the hands of terrorists . yet this support may be fragile , and could collapse if something goes wrong on the ground – or , worse , in France .
while the French public agrees that Mali cannot be allowed to become a haven for terrorists , the way Afghanistan did in the late 1990 ’ s , attitudes toward intervention have evolved in recent decades . in the early 1980 ’ s , after a particularly bloody terrorist attack on French and American forces in Lebanon , France ’ s tolerance for military casualties seemed much higher than that of the United States .
moreover , budget restrictions have severely constrained French military capabilities . French and British military intervention was successful in Libya in 2011 at least in part as a result of US military procurement .
in the years after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the Americans always had to be on the front line – battling the enemy abroad to avoid having to battle him at home , in the parlance of the time – while the European allies were perceived as the cleaning staff . but imperial fatigue after Iraq and Afghanistan has left its imprint .
if Nicolas Sarkozy , whom he defeated , was widely regarded as “ too ” presidential , Hollande has given the impression of not being presidential “ enough . ” His fall from public grace – too statist and fiscally intrusive for the right , but too moderate and social democratic for the true left – was more rapid than that of any president of the Fifth Republic .
as the supreme commander of an army at war , Hollande can now try to reinvent himself . but , successive presidents since Jacques Chirac have failed to reconcile the French with politics .
will war in Africa be the defining moment of Hollande ’ s presidency ? will he be remembered as the French Harry Truman – a discreet , uncharismatic man who , when faced with urgent and dramatic circumstances , ended up doing the right things for lack of a better alternative ?
this is a portentous moment both for Mali and for security in the Sahel and Europe . it is no less significant for Hollande and France .
France Alone ?
in March 2011 , its airstrikes in Libya ( alongside those of Great Britain ) thwarted Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi ’ s troops as they prepared to retake the city of Benghazi . a month later , French forces in Côte d ’ Ivoire arrested President Laurent Gbagbo , who had refused to recognize his rival ’ s election victory , putting the country at risk of civil war .
while the Islamists have been temporarily defeated , they are well armed and receive supplies from Libya via Algeria , which has suppressed Islamists at home but seems to turn a blind eye to their transit through its territory . moreover , the capabilities of the Malian army and those of other West African countries that are supposed to join the operation are too weak to turn the tide .
so , with the security of Europe as a whole at stake , why is France the only country involved ?
this is a profound error . France has no interest in protecting a Malian regime that it knows to be corrupt and incompetent ; indeed , France recently refused to support a request from President François Bozizé ’ s regime in the neighboring Central African Republic for aid in dealing with rebels .
France ’ s motivations are broader . in particular , France has always considered Sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab world to be natural spheres of political and strategic influence that are necessary to maintaining its position as a global power .
the second explanation is more credible : France , aside from Great Britain , is Europe ’ s only true military power . it believes that operational military capability is a condition of power – a view that is not shared by the overwhelming majority of European states , which continue to display a collective aversion to war .
in 2003 , following the start of the Iraq war , Europe embraced a strategy prepared by Javier Solana , then the European Union ’ s High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy . but , while a large number of Europeans naively believed that this was the prelude to a joint European strategy , the proposal was drafted in terms that were so vague as to allow any outcome – or none .
the EU ’ s Lisbon Treaty mentions “ permanent structured cooperation ” in security and defense policy , and an entire institutional apparatus of political and military committees exists to anticipate , prepare for , and implement military operations at the European level . but this mechanism lacks the common political will needed to activate it ; the less it is used , the less usable it will become .
during the Libyan crisis , Solana ’ s successor , Catherine Ashton , deliberately sought to limit the EU ’ s role to that of a super-NGO focused on humanitarian aid and economic development . recently , during the vote on Palestinian representation at the United Nations , the EU called for its members to abstain – an odd way to affirm Europe ’ s commitment to global leadership .
Britain has deviated from this principle only once , when it agreed to participate in the Atalanta anti-piracy operation off the Horn of Africa – probably because it was placed in command . as a result , those who want a common European defense capability lack the means to create it , while those who have the means to create it do not want it ( with the possible exception of France ) .
Britain ’ s bilateral cooperation with France – highlighted during the Libyan crisis – is sometimes very strong . but , despite the two countries ’ 2010 treaty on defense and security cooperation , the British have decided , for budgetary reasons , to acquire aircraft that will not be compatible with French aircraft carriers .
even Spain and Italy , the two countries most affected by developments in the Mediterranean and the Sahel , have reduced their military expenditures significantly . unlike Germany , both participated in the Libyan intervention , but with highly limiting rules of engagement for their forces .
its deployed forces are extremely small , accounting for 4 % of all military personnel worldwide , versus 14 % for the US . industrial cooperation , which could constitute an economic and military asset , is also weakening , as demonstrated by Germany ’ s successful opposition to the proposed EADS / BAE merger , which was officially canceled in October .
Germany had seemed to embark on a more robust policy since its participation in military operations in Afghanistan . now , however , it recoils at any prospect of military intervention , even as it remains the world ’ s third-largest arms exporter .
Europe faces real threats , which France alone cannot contain . moreover , the international system is increasingly coalescing around national powers that consider military force to be an essential prerequisite of influence .
the French Disconnection
Paris – Dire conditions can permit what was once unthinkable to push its way into public debate . in France , the idea that now dares to speak its name is that the country will sink into an ever-deeper economic malaise unless it regains its monetary sovereignty .
first , President François Hollande , worried about the euro ’ s appreciation against other major world currencies , called for an exchange-rate target . then , Pierre Moscovici , the finance minister , said that Europe might grant France a delay in meeting the 3 % -of-GDP budget-deficit target mandated from this year onward under the eurozone ’ s newly ratified fiscal compact .
these positions imply a desire to exercise sovereign power over the Economic and Monetary Union ’ s rules and decisions . back in 1989-1991 , exactly the same motive underlay President François Mitterrand ’ s imposition of the euro on Germany – that is , to harness the Bundesbank ’ s monetary power to a framework in which France could be confident of wielding decisive influence .
in a monetary union , there are only two ways to close a competitiveness gap between countries : transfers from the more competitive to the less competitive , or internal devaluation , which means real wage cuts .
following the credit-bubble burst in 2008 , fiscal transfers replaced these private financial flows , causing budget deficits to balloon . and now , with the German government , as chief creditor , calling the shots on cross-border transfers to weaker eurozone countries , all such transfers are conditional on austerity ( that is , internal devaluation ) .
bailouts from the European Stability Mechanism represent the clearest example of this , with the fiscal compact now committing signatories to tight deficit targets and structural adjustment . and more austerity is a vital , if less well remarked on , condition of the European Central Bank ’ s declared willingness to buy unlimited quantities of troubled countries ’ short-term government debt .
so far , the “ bazooka ” represented by the ECB ’ s “ outright monetary transactions ” program has had the desired effect – without having to be used . eurozone financial markets have stabilized , and the euro has appreciated against the dollar and the yen .
although the French government , unlike its Spanish and Italian counterparts , has not yet had any difficulty financing itself at low interest rates , currency appreciation as the economy slides into recession is like fuel poured onto an unlit bonfire . unless growth is restored , France ’ s already large public debt will expand unsustainably , heightening the risk that investors will shun French government bonds .
from this predicament stems the fashionable idea that the bond market would actually welcome less fiscal austerity , because this would boost economic growth , in turn making the level of public debt appear more sustainable in the long run . it is no surprise that Moscovici is beginning to push for a “ collective European decision ” to relax the fiscal treaty ’ s terms , given that French compliance would require massive new spending cuts .
will Germany agree to such a relaxation – or , for that matter , to Hollande ’ s implicit demand that the ECB follow Japan ’ s example and loosen monetary policy to drive the exchange rate back down ?
unlike Japan ( and , of course , the United States ) , France , as a member of a monetary union , cannot pursue domestic goals unilaterally . to avoid disaster , France has only two options : somehow force a change in German policy or go it alone .
the first has to do with economic and financial risks . ditching the euro might trigger a banking crisis , capital flight , inflation , and perhaps even sovereign default .
the specter of continuing economic stagnation and ever-rising unemployment ( with the young and older workers being the worst hit ) should remove the second , geopolitical obstacle to a French exit from the eurozone . for French elites since World War II , alignment with Germany has been central to projecting French power and influence .
even during that adjustment , there is no reason why relations with European partners should suffer in any fundamental sense . on the contrary , the sustainable prosperity that would result from that adjustment would create a much healthier long-term foundation for continuing the quest for an “ ever closer union ” in Europe .
why France Will Sink Europe ’ s Constitution
if public opinion polls are to be believed , on May 29 the French will reject the European Union ’ s draft constitutional treaty . because all EU member countries must ratify the constitution , a French “ Non ” will , in effect , kill it .
it is amazing because France is not just a founding member of the European Community , but also has been the main driving force behind all major steps toward “ ever closer union . ” But French opposition was also predictable because , for over a decade now , France has veered away from Europe and now finds itself increasingly isolated .
the French regard with great sadness their declining status and prestige – not only in world politics , but also in culture , science and , importantly , language . Europe , in their view , was always a way of reclaiming world influence .
France and Germany had forged an alliance that called the shots in Europe . not interested in geopolitical power – a legacy of its Nazi past – Germany was content to back France ’ s ambitions as long as the Common Market allowed it to be Europe ’ s economic powerhouse .
but that alliance is unraveling as Germany ’ s own status declines , owing to its mediocre economic performance and the loss of its prestigious Deutschemark . moreover , Germany is increasingly interested in exercising political influence on its own ; as a result , it is no longer happy with what it gets from the alliance with France .
at the same time , successive EU enlargements over the decades have brought in other powerful contenders , chiefly Spain and the UK , as well as smaller countries who are unwilling to bow before French-German leadership . in short , France has lost control of Europe .
this view , propagated since World War II by a quasi-Marxist intelligentsia , is so ingrained that the French do not even bother to understand how markets operate . they look upon economics as an ideological battleground , where all views can be entertained without being confronted with logic , much less with facts .
growth has been lackluster for a quarter of a century and unemployment remains stubbornly high . urban crime , once described as the wages of unfettered individualism , now resembles what is found in the United States , the French model ’ s bête noire .
one after the other , most European countries have reformed their economies , shedding the cozy arrangements that used to protect every interest group from the pressure of competition . even Germany , after even worse performance than France , has now taken decisive steps .
unable to reform their labor markets because of the fear of street protests , French governments of all political stripes seek to protect their ailing firms , only to face limits imposed by the rules of the Common Market . the bloated French public sector , which many see as the employer of last resort , cannot afford its expensive personnel .
while many private French firms are thriving , they do so by economizing on manpower and , increasingly , by outsourcing production , often to new EU member countries where labor costs are considerably lower . public education is in shambles and France ’ s higher education system now faces competition from other European countries .
humbled by economic malaise and loss of influence , the French are scared . they fear the future , because the future means either market-oriented reforms or further economic and political downgrading , both of which are seen as unacceptable , if only because they clash with French self-esteem .
the European Constitution has little to do with any of these challenges , but a majority of French people has started questioning the strategy that has long masked France ’ s diminishing status . they are alarmed by what they see as the domination of Anglo-Saxon economic principles – the last nail in the coffin of France ’ s mythical “ exception . ”
of course , most French people would ultimately benefit from doing away with this inefficient web of big and small privileges , but most voters , depressed by poor economic prospects and unnerved by high unemployment , are simply unwilling to take the risk . they do not understand the roots of their economic troubles and are nostalgic for better times .
Bismarck versus Bismarck
after the interlude of the Cold War , during which Germany served as the center of discord between East and West , reunification permitted the reassertion of German power within the context of the European Union and , most notably , the eurozone . today , however , the question is whether Germany is ready and willing to provide leadership in the conduct of the EU ’ s affairs – and , if so , to what end .
in Spain and Greece , more than one-quarter of the labor force is jobless , while the unemployment rate hovers around 60 % among young people . despite harsh austerity , large fiscal deficits persist , and banks remain undercapitalized and unable to support a sustained economic recovery .
social malaise is deepening as expectations – and actual prospects – for economic improvement are likely to remain poor for the foreseeable future . faith in the European project is declining , and , given the eurozone ’ s lack of cohesion , stagnation and recession may lead to popular rejection of the EU , accompanied by serious challenges to democracy , including the rise of neo-fascist parties .
but prolonged inaction , induced by relative calm in financial markets , will perpetuate stagnation and eventually lead to a breakup of one sort or another . either gradual attrition , with weaker countries defaulting , will lead to a more restricted German-led club of “ virtuous ” countries , or Germany itself will choose to pursue a policy of narrow fiscal advantage by seceding from the eurozone .
the political and economic weakness of France and Italy , together with Britain ’ s gradual withdrawal from EU affairs , highlight Germany ’ s key role in rescuing the eurozone from the current crisis . but true leadership requires a sense of direction and a willingness to pay up , and , here , Germany has lately been found wanting .
despite German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s evident political skills and high domestic standing , her government lacks a concrete design for “ ever closer Union ” in Europe . as a result , it , too , is in a weak position to mobilize the resources and competences required to restore Europe .
this policy cannot endure for long . either stagnation will lead to the eurozone ’ s breakup , or circumstances will force a policy change .
national banking systems should be unified , in order to separate private losses from sovereign debt , with centralized supervision and resolution authorities , as well as a deposit-insurance scheme , forming the core of a European banking union . strong central institutions , responsible to a directly elected parliament , are needed to coordinate fiscal and economic policies .
in the shorter term , the single market should be extended to services , and free-trade arrangements should be promoted either multilaterally or bilaterally with major trading partners such as the United States . austerity should be eased , particularly in the fiscally stronger core economies , and substantial resources should be devoted to boosting youth employment and investment in small and medium-size firms in the over-indebted countries .
Germany ’ s reluctance to lead on these issues partly reflects historical inhibitions , which are always difficult to overcome . the persistence of pre-Keynesian orthodoxy in German economic thought , with its moral abhorrence of the “ sin of borrowing ” ( and thus its neglect of aggregate demand ) , does not help , either .
nonetheless , Germany must accept that the alternative to a democratically unified currency union is German economic hegemony . in the longer run , that outcome would destroy the common European project , in turn undermining Germany ’ s own economic prosperity and strategic security – a Bismarckian scenario from which Bismarck would have recoiled in horror .
why Germany Should Lead or Leave
when the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers endangered the credit of financial institutions , private credit was replaced by the credit of the state , revealing an unrecognized flaw in the euro . by transferring their right to print money to the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , member countries exposed themselves to the risk of default , like Third World countries heavily indebted in a foreign currency .
there is a parallel between the ongoing euro crisis and the international banking crisis of 1982 . back then , the International Monetary Fund saved the global banking system by lending just enough money to heavily indebted countries ; default was avoided , but at the cost of a lasting depression .
the setting differs , but the effect is the same . creditors are shifting the entire burden of adjustment on to the debtor countries and avoiding their own responsibility .
the euro crisis is a complex mixture of banking and sovereign-debt problems , as well as divergences in economic performance that have given rise to balance-of-payments imbalances within the eurozone . the authorities did not understand the complexity of the crisis , let alone see a solution .
financial panics subside , and the authorities realize a profit on their intervention . but not this time , because the financial problems were combined with a process of political disintegration .
when the European Union was created , it was the embodiment of an open society – a voluntary association of equal states that surrendered part of their sovereignty for the common good . the euro crisis is now turning the EU into something fundamentally different , dividing member countries into two classes – creditors and debtors – with the creditors in charge .
to make matters worse , the Bundesbank remains committed to an outmoded monetary doctrine rooted in Germany ’ s traumatic experience with inflation . as a result , it recognizes only inflation as a threat to stability , and ignores deflation , which is the real threat today .
there is a real danger that a two-tier Europe will become permanent . both human and financial resources will be attracted to the center , leaving the periphery permanently depressed .
Europe ’ s tragedy is not the result of an evil plot , but stems , rather , from a lack of coherent policies . as in ancient Greek tragedies , misconceptions and a sheer lack of understanding have had unintended but fateful consequences .
Germany , as the largest creditor country , is in charge , but refuses to take on additional liabilities ; as a result , every opportunity to resolve the crisis has been missed . the crisis spread from Greece to other deficit countries , eventually calling into question the euro ’ s very survival .
most recently , German Chancellor Angela Merkel has backed ECB President Mario Draghi , leaving Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann isolated . this will enable the ECB to put a lid on the borrowing costs of countries that submit to an austerity program under the supervision of the Troika ( the IMF , the ECB , and the European Commission ) .
the debtors are bound to reject a two-tier Europe sooner or later . if the euro breaks up in disarray , the common market and the EU will be destroyed , leaving Europe worse off than it was when the effort to unite it began , owing to a legacy of mutual mistrust and hostility .
in my judgment , the best course of action is to persuade Germany to choose between either leading the creation of a political union with genuine burden-sharing , or leaving the euro .
since all of the accumulated debt is denominated in euros , it makes all the difference who remains in charge of the monetary union.If Germany left , the euro would depreciate . debtor countries would regain their competitiveness ; their debt would diminish in real terms ; and , with the ECB under their control , the threat of default would disappear and their borrowing costs would fall to levels comparable to that in the United Kingdom .
the creditor countries , by contrast , would incur losses on their claims and investments denominated in euros and encounter stiffer competition at home from other eurozone members . the extent of creditor countries ’ losses would depend on the extent of the depreciation , giving them an interest in keeping the depreciation within bounds .
after initial dislocations , the eventual outcome would fulfill John Maynard Keynes ’ dream of an international currency system in which both creditors and debtors share responsibility for maintaining stability . and Europe would avert the looming depression .
whether Germany decides to lead or leave , either alternative would be better than creating an unsustainable two-tier Europe .
why Greece Declined a Euro Holiday
Brussels – For the entire first half of this year , since the far-left , anti-austerity Syriza party came to power in January , the Greek saga virtually monopolized the attention of European policymakers . even as their country ’ s economy crashed , Greece ’ s new government remained adamant in demanding debt relief without austerity – that is , until mid-July , when they suddenly agreed to the creditors ’ terms .
why did the Greek government concede to terms that not only controverted its own promises , but also closely resembled those that voters had overwhelmingly rejected in a popular referendum barely a week earlier ?
many believe that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was responding to an ultimatum from his European partners : accept our demands or leave the euro . the question is why a Greek exit from the euro ( “ Grexit ” ) amounted to such a potent threat .
after all , the main short-term cost – financial-system disruption – has already materialized in Greece : banks and the stock market have been shut down , and capital controls have been imposed . while those actions were needed to stem large-scale capital flight and prevent the banking system ’ s collapse , they also caused the Greek economy to contract sharply .
in this context , Greek negotiators might have considered another proposal , circulated informally by the German finance ministry , recommending that Greece receive immediate debt forgiveness , in exchange for leaving the euro temporarily . if Greece remained in the euro , no relief would be granted – a proviso consistent with the German position that debt restructuring for eurozone countries would be illegal .
the German proposal , spearheaded by Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble , highlights the fundamental change that has occurred in Greece ’ s relationship with its European partners since its last bailout package three years ago . in 2012 , Greece was offered hundreds of billions of euros in financial support , and its creditors , including Greek commercial banks , were pushed to accept substantial “ voluntary ” haircuts .
Tsipras ’ s government , by contrast , was able to hold its referendum , and even campaign against the creditors ’ proposed adjustment program ( which , it should be noted , was no longer on the table ) . even the resounding “ no ” delivered by Greek voters could not strengthen the government ’ s negotiating position , for a simple reason : Grexit is no longer considered a threat to the euro ’ s stability .
one can only speculate about Schäuble ’ s motivation in pushing for Grexit . he seems to believe that a more integrated eurozone , though certainly desirable , is not feasible with a country that cannot be trusted to abide by the terms to which its government has agreed .
whatever Schäuble ’ s reasons , his proposal could have represented a way out for Greece , whose economy had been squeezed dry by austerity and whose banking system was already closed . immediate debt reduction and the recovery of economic sovereignty – even at the expense of exiting the euro , at least temporarily – would seem to have offered significant long-term benefits .
this suggests that , during the negotiations , Greece ’ s leaders were driven by more than economics . perhaps , contrary to popular belief , countries ’ political attachment to Europe via the euro remains very strong , even where , as in Greece , people have endured unprecedented hardship since joining the monetary union .
the monetary union ’ s rationale , as many have noted , was always more political than economic . for precisely that reason , it may well be too early to write off the single currency .
why India is Riskier than China
Asia ’ s developing and newly industrialized economies grew at an 8.5 % average annual rate over 2010-11 – nearly triple the 3 % growth elsewhere in the world . if China and India are next to fall , Asia would be at risk , and it would be hard to avoid a global recession .
China is sensitive to downside risks to external demand – more relevant than ever since crisis-torn Europe and the United States collectively accounted for 38 % of total exports in 2010 . but India , with its large current-account deficit and external funding needs , is more exposed to tough conditions in global financial markets .
yes , China is paying a price for aggressive economic stimulus undertaken in the depths of the subprime crisis . the banking system funded the bulk of the additional spending , and thus is exposed to any deterioration in credit quality that may have arisen from such efforts .
while none of these problems should be minimized , they are unlikely to trigger a hard landing . long fixated on stability , Chinese policymakers have been quick to take preemptive action .
administrative measures in the agricultural sector , aimed at alleviating supply bottlenecks for pork , cooking oil , fresh vegetables , and fertilizer , have pushed food-price inflation lower . this is the main reason why the headline consumer inflation rate receded from 6.5 % in July 2011 to 4.2 % in November .
meanwhile , the People ’ s Bank of China , which hiked benchmark one-year lending rates five times in the 12 months ending this October , to 6.5 % , now has plenty of scope for monetary easing should economic conditions deteriorate . the same is true with mandatory reserves in the banking sector , where the government has already pruned 50 basis points off the record 21.5 % required-reserve ratio .
nor has China been passive with respect to mounting speculative excesses in residential property . in April 2010 , it implemented tough new regulations , raising down-payments from 20 % to 30 % for a first home , to 50 % for a second residence , and to 100 % for purchases of three or more units .
moreover , it is a serious exaggeration to claim , as many do today , that the Chinese economy is one massive real-estate bubble . yes , total fixed investment is approaching an unprecedented 50 % of GDP , but residential and nonresidential real estate , combined , accounts for only 15-20 % of that – no more than 10 % of the overall economy .
as for Chinese banks , the main problem appears to be exposure to ballooning local-government debt , which , according to the government , totaled $ 1.7 trillion ( roughly 30 % of GDP ) at the end of 2010 . approximately half of this debt was on their books prior to the crisis .
some of the new debt that resulted from the stimulus could well end up being impaired , but ongoing urbanization – around 15-20 million people per year move to cities – provides enormous support on the demand side for investment in infrastructure development and residential and commercial construction . that tempers the risks to credit quality and , along with relatively low loan-to-deposit ratios of around 65 % , should cushion the Chinese banking system .
like China , India ’ s economic-growth momentum is ebbing . but unlike China , the downshift is more pronounced – GDP growth fell through the 7 % threshold in the third calendar-year quarter of 2011 , and annual industrial output actually fell by 5.1 % in October .
that means that the Reserve Bank of India – which has hiked its benchmark policy rate 13 times since the start of 2010 to deal with a still-serious inflation problem – can ill afford to ease monetary policy . moreover , an outsize consolidated government budget deficit of around 9 % of GDP limits India ’ s fiscal-policy discretion .
while China is in better shape than India , neither economy is likely to implode on its own . it would take another shock to trigger a hard landing in Asia . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
one obvious possibility today would be a disruptive breakup of the European Monetary Union . in that case , both China and India , like most of the world ’ s economies , could find themselves in serious difficulty – with an outright contraction of Chinese exports , as in late 2008 and early 2009 , and heightened external funding pressures for India .
consequently , I attach a low probability to the currency union ’ s disintegration . barring such a worst-case outcome for Europe , the odds of a hard landing in either India or China should remain low .
Japanese-like stagnation in the developed world is challenging externally dependent Asia to shift its focus to internal demand . downside pressures currently squeezing China and India underscore that challenge .
why is China Booming ?
or the court might test out a new era name after a political debacle , in an effort to wipe the slate clean . the last emperor of the Tang Dynasty proclaimed seven era names in fourteen years , as he sought in vain to “ re-brand ” his reign and avoid his regime ’ s demise .
“ Reform ” suggested a loosening of central controls on economic life , undertaken in a spirit of pragmatism and gradualism , as an antidote to Mao Zedong ’ s ideology of “ revolution . ” Similarly , “ opening ” heralded the PRC ’ s integration into the world community – especially the capitalist West .
one must go back to the Qing Dynasty ( 1644-1912 ) and its 60-year era of “ heavenly flourishing ” ( Qianlong ) in the eighteenth century to find a comparable period of coherent political and economic policy . the era of “ reform and opening ” has outlived its “ emperor ” by more than a decade , and has been the common thread running through transfers of political authority from Deng to Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao .
if one factor undergirds China ’ s commitment to “ reform and opening , ” it is the extraordinary macroeconomic changes of the past 30 years . in China , people call it fazhan , or “ development , ” but in much of rest of the world , it is more commonly described simply as the “ China Boom , ” or the “ China Miracle . ”
indeed , there have been many smaller “ booms ” – in consumption , foreign direct investment , domestic stock markets , trade , travel , overseas study , military modernization , and international diplomacy . there is also a boom in pollution and toxic waste , and booming interest in religion – from Buddhism to Pentecostal Christianity – and in Confucian philosophy .
a leading fashion industry executive argues that a key engine driving the economic boom has been the influx of women into the workforce , particularly in the manufacturing zones of the south . another compelling explanation comes from a venture capitalist who credits Chinese society with copious reserves of entrepreneurial energy that derives , he believes , from the fact that Chinese culture attaches very little shame to failing in a business enterprise .
whatever the cause , the boom seems an unlikely capstone to a century of war , ferment , and revolution , and only adds to the sense of discontinuity that characterizes modern China . certainly , few observers looking in 1978 at the smoldering embers of the Cultural Revolution , or at the seeming ruination of the post-1989 years , thought China would emerge as the lightning rod of the world ’ s developmental hopes .
the tumult of the Maoist period instilled in a broad cross-section of people a profound appreciation for stability , and a yearning to be left alone . Deng capitalized on this revolution-weariness by diminishing the role of politics and the state in people ’ s private lives and freeing them to release their pent-up energy to pursue their own goals .
Mao ’ s revolution fueled countless rectification movements and campaigns that inverted the once-inviolate primacy of ruler over ruled , scholar over worker , husband over wife , father over son , and family over individual . by the time of the reforms of the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , bonds tying individuals to culture , the state , the work unit , and household-registration systems , for example , had largely unraveled .
environmental damage has been staggering , the gap between rich and poor has been growing , and urbanization – with all its attendant problems – has surged . and , at least so far , the boom has not induced the systemic political changes for which many hoped .
but still , a key question remains unanswered : why did China ’ s boom happen ? this is one of the great questions of our time , relevant not only to China ’ s future , but to scores of other developing countries enthralled by China ’ s extraordinary , but still largely unexplained , success .
why is China Lashing Out ?
new YORK – It must be galling for the Chinese government to keep seeing Nobel Prizes go to the wrong Chinese .
the first wrong Chinese was Gao Xingjian , a critical playwright , artist , and novelist , who received the Nobel Prize for literature in 2000 , while living in exile in Paris . the latest is Liu Xiaobo , a literary critic and political writer , who was awarded this year ’ s Nobel Prize for Peace while serving a prison sentence for “ subversion ” of the Communist regime .
instead of a show of lofty disdain , or official silence , it made a colossal fuss , protesting fiercely about plots to undermine China , and putting dozens of prominent Chinese intellectuals , including Liu ’ s wife , Liu Xia , under house arrest . as a result , the utterly powerless , hitherto quite obscure Liu Xiaobo , has become not only world famous , but much better known inside China , too .
these strong-arm tactics stand out even more against the deftness of Chinese diplomacy over the last few decades . Japan , the old wartime enemy , has been outmaneuvered repeatedly , and a soft touch made South Koreans and Southeast Asians feel relatively comfortable with China ’ s increasing power .
as the warm welcome given to Hillary Clinton on her recent swing through Asia – even in communist Vietnam – appears to show , Southeast Asians are more than happy to hang on to Pax Americana for a bit longer , out of fear of China . other Asian countries might even be drawn closer to Japan , the only alternative to the US as a counterbalance to the Middle Kingdom .
for the first time in almost 200 years , China can really throw its weight around , and it will do what it wants , regardless of what other countries may think . a few decades ago , it was Japan that thought it was going to be Number One , and its businessmen , politicians , and bureaucrats were not shy about letting the rest of the world know .
Communist ideology is a spent force . using the People ’ s Liberation Army to murder civilian protesters , not only in Beijing , but all over China in June 1989 , further undermined the one-party system ’ s legitimacy .
the ideological vacuum left by the death of Marxist orthodoxy was filled with nationalism . and nationalism in China , promoted through schools , mass media , and “ patriotic ” monuments and museums , means one thing : only the firm rule of the CCP will prevent foreigners , especially Westerners and the Japanese , from humiliating Chinese ever again .
it is why the government does not dare to let the renminbi appreciate too fast , lest economic growth slow , causing the Party loses face and legitimacy . and it is why bullying Japan is always a good option : China ’ s rulers do not necessarily hate Japan , but they are afraid to look weak in the eyes of their citizens , who are taught from kindergarten that foreign powers want to humiliate China .
this suggests that if Liu Xiaobo and like-minded dissidents ever got their wish , and democracy came to China , the problem of Chinese nationalism would not go away . after all , if the people feel persecuted by Japan or the United States , then the people will demand chauvinistic policies .
nationalism is often fed by a sense of impotence . when citizens feel disempowered by an authoritarian government , the next best thing is to feel empowered by national prowess .
in a multi-party democracy , on the other hand , citizens are concerned with other interests , material , social , even cultural ones , and thus less likely to be drawn into aggressive chauvinism . or so we must hope .
why is France Burning ?
the analogy is misleading . while the 1968 protests challenged the French Republican model to live up to its finest aspirations , today ’ s crisis challenges the French Revolution ’ s model of citizenship and integration itself .
to achieve this shared identity , all citizens have to speak the one official language and be educated according to a common curriculum . but they also enjoy equal rights , and have the same duties , in the public arena .
all this is not only fostered by the state , but also requires the kind of uniformity that only a centralized state can impose . indeed , the French Revolution ’ s ideological commitment to unity was so strong that during parts of the nineteenth century , advocating federalism was a capital offense .
three components of this model incited today ’ s crisis and make it difficult for the French Republic to address it effectively .
the first component is the classic French Republican prohibition on gathering data in the official census – or by government agencies or public or private enterprises – on ethnicity , religion , and even social class . collecting these data would , it is argued , violate the Republican tenet that France is “ one and indivisible . ”
but the absence of a secondary breakdown of such data , like the UK-style , four-fold class analysis ( plus examination of patterns of unemployment by ethnicity or religion ) , makes it hard for social workers , public heath officials , and economic planners to diagnose new problems . without the necessary data for analysis , public health policies , for example , cannot be directed toward groups that are especially disadvantaged or otherwise at risk .
the second factor is the classic French Republican rejection of , and legal norms against , any form of “ affirmative action , ” or positive discrimination , even of the most inoffensive kind . like the prohibition of fine-tuned data – without which positive discrimination is in any case impossible – affirmative action is seen as damaging to the Republican model because it is based on recognition of ethnic differences .
the third component is the post-welfare state , which is now part of the French model of citizenship and guarantees all full-time employees one of the highest minimum wages in the world and high employer-paid benefits . this makes it extremely difficult to let workers go , which makes employers reluctant to hire new people in the first place .
many of the social-democratic countries of Europe , like Sweden , Holland , and Denmark , created similar norms in their full-employment eras . unlike France , however , they also used census data to identify pockets of new unemployment , and to invest socially and politically , not only in excellent job-training programs , but in job creation , and , just as importantly , in job-placement schemes .
it has few training programs , but high benefits for the unemployed and strong restrictions against firing workers . put all of this together , and it is like slamming a door in the face of young minority men looking for work .
this is the primary cause of the 30-50 % unemployment rates among minorities aged 16-24 in many French “ urban zones of sensitivity . ” Thus , the riots that France is now seeing emerge from French policies , not from instigations by Islamists .
France has simply failed to incorporate minority citizens – many of them third-generation immigrants who have been educated for twenty years in assimilationist public schools . but few political leaders accept that the crisis has anything to do with the French model of citizenship .
a newly created Minister of Social Cohesion has begun to commission studies documenting discrimination . one study showed that for similarly qualified job applicants , those with an Islamic-sounding name , and an address in an ethnically segmented suburb , had only one-fifth the chance of even getting an interview as people with a French-sounding name and a “ safe ” address .
two hundred and fifty of the largest private and public enterprises have created an organization aimed at working with the government to allow them , for the first time ever , to document , and then redress , their discriminatory employment practices .
fortunately , organized Muslim leaders so far have not aggravated the rioting . of course , the government ’ s reduction of community policing in favor of paramilitary forces stationed in quasi-military barracks , and the Minister of Interior ’ s description of the young rioters as “ scum ” who should be washed away with an industrial power hose , has not helped .
the French Republican model enshrines the laudable abstract principles of liberty , equality , and fraternity . however , so long as second- and third-generation minority citizens are taught that the only acceptable cultural identity is French , but are not in fact accepted as French – indeed , are blocked from enjoying the full rights of French citizenship – the Republican model will fuel alienation rather than democratic integration .
why Is Physics Beautiful ?
not long after , Albert Einstein called Niels Bohr ’ s atomic model “ the highest form of musicality in the sphere of thought . ” More recently , the late Nobel laureate Richard Feynman , describing his discovery of new laws of physics , declared , “ You can recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity . ”
physics , as summarized in a handful of mathematically precise laws , indisputably works . yet many things that “ work ” do not inspire the kind of admiration that the fundamental laws of nature do .
just as a circle can be rotated about its center at any angle , changing the position of each of its points without changing its form , symmetric laws apply to changed situations without changing or losing validity . for example , special relativity asserts that the fundamental laws of physics remain the same when we view the world from a platform moving at constant velocity .
just a handful of basic principles generates an astonishing wealth of consequences – everything in the physical world ! you can write the equations of the core theories of physics – known as the standard model – quite comfortably on a T-shirt .
consider this hypothetical situation : developments in computer power , virtual reality , and artificial intelligence enable the creation of self-aware beings whose “ world ” is , from our perspective , a programmed simulation . if a self-aware Super Mario began to analyze the laws of his world , he would find very little symmetry or productivity .
it has led people throughout history to believe that some tasteful higher being created us , and that we inhabit a consciously designed world , like our notional Super Mario . but this is an extravagant hypothesis , which goes far beyond the facts it is meant to explain .
they are , in neurobiological terms , things that stimulate our reward system . that explains why parents tend to find their young children beautiful , and adults are attracted to nubile models and their images .
understanding the forces and patterns defining our world , and especially principles that apply ( without changing ) to a wide variety of situations , can help to improve our predictions . the fact that we can often infer the behavior of complex objects or systems from knowledge of their parts – that we get back more than we put in – can help us to hone our predictions further .
in short , because evolution predisposes us to find beautiful those things that help us understand the world correctly , it is no accident that we find the correct laws of nature beautiful . viewed from this perspective , the apparent beauty of the laws of physics – our attraction to their symmetry and exuberance – is not surprising .
they are difficult and expensive to access experimentally , and we cannot rely on our intuition to fill in the blanks . the patient accumulation of fact recommended by Francis Bacon , Isaac Newton , and Sherlock Holmes is thus no longer practical .
in recent decades , that strategy has proved remarkably successful . it has given us quantum chromodynamics , which resolves the central problem of nuclear physics , as well as predicting the Higgs particle and much else .
rather than recognizing the beauty of laws otherwise discovered , we use principles of beauty – vast symmetry and a high ratio of output to input – to enable discovery . when this works , we have an “ anthropic ” explanation of the laws ’ beauty : if they were not beautiful , we would not have found them .
pulling the OMT Trigger
as long as investors believe that Italy and Spain will eventually be rescued by the OMT , these countries ’ borrowing costs will be low , and the rescue will not be needed . if , however , the slightest doubt about the OMT ’ s effectiveness arises , the expectation game will shift into reverse , and both countries ’ bonds will quickly come under attack .
the rules vary among EU countries , but , in Germany , “ government approval ” implies parliamentary approval . in an emergency situation , it is difficult to imagine that Germany will not prefer approval to the disaster of an Italian or Spanish default .
to eliminate this uncertainty , Italy and Spain should ask for the OMT intervention before it is desperately needed – a request that the Bundestag would most likely approve , viewing it as an insurance scheme rather than a pure transfer . doing so would also eliminate the uncertainty surrounding the program itself and its implementation mechanisms .
finally , an early request for OMT intervention would not only reduce the Italian and Spanish governments ’ borrowing costs ( and thus their fiscal deficits ) , but would also lower the cost of capital for local firms , which currently find it difficult to borrow and invest . thus , it would provide a much-needed boost to these countries ’ struggling economies .
as a result , they waited too long . the same is true of the OMT program : elected politicians fear that triggering it would be perceived as a sign of weakness , implying a cost that they have a strong incentive to delay paying .
but why is Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti , who is not an elected politician ( and has promised not to run for election ) , so hesitant ? given that he does not have to fear electoral defeat , he could help Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy by filing first , which would weaken the political stigma for Rajoy ’ s government were it to file subsequently .
in fact , if one were to imagine reasons why Germany might not approve a request by Italy to trigger the OMT , political turmoil would top the list . by contrast , triggering the OMT in advance would promote political stability in the face of uncertainty , because it would tie the hands of any future Italian government .
Monti wants to be remembered as the prime minister who saved Italy from disaster . he does not want to go down in history as the prime minister who had to surrender Italy ’ s sovereignty to save the country from default .
delay for either of these reasons would be a very selfish act . Monti should not risk European stability for his personal benefit .
why Mexico is Sick
our home is far , far away from us . ” That ’ s how it feels to live in Mexico nowadays : far from democratic normalcy ; far from a health system that inspires confidence ; far from a government that builds trust ; far from home and close to everything that imperils it .
my homeland has become a place where too many people are victims , succumbing to a virus , or gunned down by a drug-trafficker ; assaulted by a robber , shot by an ill-trained policeman , or kidnapped by a member of a criminal gang . the flu epidemic , which probably began in the southern state of Veracruz , is yet another sign that all is not well in Mexico .
the country seems to be caught in a permanent , uneasy tug-of-war between the past and the future , between change and the actors who seek to place obstacles in its path . for example , when initial reports surfaced about the first swine flu cases , it took three weeks for the information to reach federal health authorities , because state governments were reluctant to report cases quickly due to political and electoral considerations .
in contrast with Mexico ’ s authoritarian past , when an “ imperial presidency ” constituted a major obstacle to modernization , power has been dispersed . what the executive branch has relinquished , or been forced to give up , vested interests have seized .
the problem is no longer too much power in the president ’ s hands , but too much power in the hands of “ veto centers ” – including public-sector unions – that are blocking much-needed reforms , including in the health system . in all likelihood , the 22 reported dead from swine flu reflect a social safety net falling to pieces due to lack of public investment and union recalcitrance .
the flu also revealed some of Mexico ’ s other fundamental flaws . the political system has become a peculiar hybrid of authoritarian remnants and newly established mechanisms for transparency .
impunity , in turn , erodes the credibility of the country ’ s institutions , including public hospitals and clinics . today , conspiracy theories abound in Mexico about the origins of the virus , because government officials are viewed with such ingrained suspicion .
public-opinion polls reveal that more than 50 % of the population believe that political parties are “ not necessary ” for the good of the country . disapproval of Congress is growing , and people ’ s satisfaction with representative democracy has decreased .
Seventy-five percent of crimes are not reported due to lack of trust in the authorities , and 98 % of crimes are never resolved or punished . public opinion seems disenchanted with a democracy incapable of offering tangible solutions to problems , the flu crisis being the most recent example .
saddled by a viral infection , drug-related insecurity , and rising crime , Mexico feels like a besieged place . the noted columnist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa wrote last week : “ All that ’ s missing is for Mexico to get peed on by a dog . ”
Mexico ’ s bad health is a symptom of problems that run deeper and are more widespread than swine flu . over the past ten years , political and economic actors intent on preserving the status quo have blocked further democratic change and economic reform , condemning Mexico to move sideways , even as other emerging markets surge ahead .
Mexico ’ s current quandary is the flu , but it faces more important challenges than a mutating microbe . with more than 40 million people living in poverty and 7,000 killed in drug-related violence last year , Mexico will need to reform quickly to address what the virus has brought to light : a government far removed from the suffering of ordinary people and too frequently insensitive to their plight .
in this national crisis , Mexico ’ s people have closed ranks , collaborated , and showed that they are capable of working together to achieve common goals in the public interest . but their political and economic elites frequently seem incapable of doing so .
natural-born Pianists ?
London – The editor of The Guardian , Alan Rusbridger , has written a book about how he decided to practice the piano 20 minutes a day . eighteen months later , he played Chopin ’ s fearsomely difficult Ballade No. 1 in G Minor to an admiring audience of friends .
it is unresolved because the scientific question has always been entangled with politics . broadly speaking , those stressing inborn capacity have been political conservatives ; those emphasizing nurture have been political radicals .
the nineteenth-century philosopher John Stuart Mill was of the “ anyone can do it ” school . he was convinced that his achievements were in no way due to superior heredity : anyone of “ normal intelligence and health , ” subjected to his father ’ s educational system – which included learning Greek at the age of three – could have become John Stuart Mill .
Mill was part of his century ’ s liberal attack on aristocratic privilege : achievement was the result of opportunity , not birth . the practice of the faculties ( education ) unleashes potential that would otherwise remain dormant .
Charles Darwin seemingly overturned this optimistic view of the potential beneficial effects of nurture . species evolve , Darwin said , through “ natural selection ” – the random selection , through competition , of biological traits favorable to survival in a world of scarce resources .
social Darwinists interpreted natural selection to mean that any humanitarian effort to improve the condition of the poor would impede the progress of the human race by burdening it with an excess of drones . society would be spending scarce resources on losers rather than winners .
indeed , social Darwinism provided a pseudo-scientific justification for the American belief in laissez-faire ( with the successful businessman epitomizing the survival of the fittest ) ; for eugenics ( the deliberate attempt to breed superior individuals , on the model of horse-breeding , and prevent the “ over-breeding ” of the unfit ) ; and for the eugenic-cum-racial theories of Nazism .
in reaction to social Darwinism ’ s murderous tendencies , Mill ’ s view became dominant after World War II in the form of social democracy . state action to improve diet , education , health , and housing would enable the poor to realize their potential .
differences in innate ability were not denied ( at least by the sensible ) . but it was rightly felt that there was a huge amount of work to be done to raise average levels of achievement before one needed to start worrying that one ’ s policies were promoting the survival of the unfit .
in 1976 , the biologist Richard Dawkins identified the unit of Darwinian selection as the “ selfish gene . ” The evolutionary story was now recast as a battle of genes to secure their survival over time by means of mutations , which create individuals ( phenotypes ) best adapted to pass on their genes .
although this view of evolution would not have been possible before the discovery of DNA , it is no coincidence that it rose to prominence in the age of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher . to be sure , the selfish gene needs to be “ altruistic ” insofar as its survival depends on the survival of the kinship group .
since then , we have turned away from advocacy of selfishness , but we have not recovered an independent moral language . the new orthodoxy , suitable for a world in which the unrestrained pursuit of greed has proved economically disastrous , is that the human species is genetically programmed to be moral , because only by acting morally ( caring for the survival of others ) can it ensure its long-term survival .
the “ hard-wiring ” metaphor dominates contemporary moral language . according to the United Kingdom ’ s chief rabbi , Jonathan Sacks , religious beliefs are useful for our survival , by inducing us to act in socially cooperative ways : “ We have mirror neurons that lead us to feel pain when we see others suffering , ” he recently wrote .
but it is an extraordinary statement for a religious leader to make , because it sets to one side the question of the truth or falsehood , or the ethical value , of religious beliefs . or rather : all that wiring in the prefrontal cortex must be ethical , because it is good for survival .
we need to assert what philosophers and religious teachers have at all times asserted : that there is something called the good life , apart from survival , and our understanding of it has to be taught , just as Mill ’ s father taught him the elements of Aristotle ’ s Posterior Analytics . our nature may predispose us to learn ; but what we learn depends on how we are nurtured .
Obama ’ s Rocky Path to Success in Syria
the US , it is said , took no decisive action while 100,000 Syrians were dying , and it had no strategy to end the conflict . Obama created expectations that the US would act if chemical weapons were used , only to stall when the time came .
there was never a time in the crisis , until the chemical-weapons issue erupted , when US military intervention in any form seemed likely to save more lives than it would endanger . the increasing influence of jihadists in the rebel ranks made support for an outright opposition victory increasingly untenable .
that is true in the West generally , as shown by the United Kingdom ’ s parliamentary vote against participating in any intervention . for almost everyone , George W. Bush ’ s “ decisiveness ” made vacillation seem like a better option .
a descent into chemical-weapons hell has been averted , almost certainly permanently : the Assad regime knows that it has no friends or protectors left should it cross that red line again . military intervention , with all of its problems , has been avoided for now ; but Assad knows that the US will have no option but to attack – with or without explicit Security Council and Congressional resolutions – should he perpetrate another such horror .
above all , diplomatic cooperation on chemical weapons has opened the door at last to a negotiated settlement of the underlying conflict in Syria . and the UN is back at center stage , as a rules-based international order demands that it should be on such issues , with both its weapons inspectors and the Security Council regarded as central to future developments .
there always are . if the justified intervention in Libya by the US , the UK , and France had not later been conducted with such cloth-eared indifference to Russian , Chinese , and developing-country concern about mandate overreach , greater unity on Syria could have been achieved in the Security Council in 2011 , when a united message might have stopped Assad cold .
going to Congress for approval was always going to involve more risks than rewards . Secretary of State John Kerry ’ s description of the planned US military response to the Ghouta massacre as likely to be “ unbelievably small ” almost derailed the utility of the US threat in concentrating Syrian and Russian officials ’ minds .
what has trumped these missteps , and enabled each side to focus on opportunities rather than excuses , is that both the US and Russia now understand that they have common interests in Syria . both sides want not only to preclude the Assad regime ’ s further use of chemical weapons , but also to find a route to sustainable peace in Syria , and to reestablish the authority and utility of the UN in these situations .
either a beleaguered Assad or an increasingly desperate opposition might destroy the deal on the ground . the fragile rapprochement between the US and Russia may not hold , particularly if the US again insists – breaking its recent helpful silence – that Assad has no place at the negotiating table .
but when the major powers cooperate in a just cause , the world is a safer and saner place . that is where both the US and Russia – and on this issue China as well – want to be .
the US with Iran in Syria
Princeton – The prospect of a US military strike on Syria has dimmed following President Barack Obama ’ s embrace of an international initiative to take control of Syria ’ s chemical-weapons stockpile . the eleventh-hour U-turn on the push for military action has come against a backdrop of intensifying diplomatic pressure from the international community to avoid escalation of the violence in Syria .
in a joint press conference with his Syrian counterpart , Walid al-Moallem , Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov tabled a proposal , originally agreed with Iran , calling for Syria to “ place chemical weapons storage sites under international control . ” The stockpiles would then be destroyed and Syria would fully join the international Chemical Weapons Convention .
Moallem immediately embraced the proposal . hours later , UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon did as well , while Obama said that “ I fervently hope that this can be resolved in a non-military way . ”
but the matter is far from settled : Obama has not ruled out a military strike . so here are 12 reasons why America should grasp the opportunity for a diplomatic resolution afforded by the Russian-Iranian plan .
first , there is evidence that the Syrian opposition has amassed chemical weapons . in December 2012 , Iran officially informed the US about chemical weapons , including sarin gas , being transferred to Syria .
second , US military strikes on Syria have the potential to engulf the entire region – and perhaps the US – in a broader war . after its experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq over the past decade , the US can hardly afford a Syrian quagmire .
third , with the regional Sunni-Shia conflict intensifying , the prospect of tens of billions of petrodollars backing terrorist extremists has already destabilized the region . US military strikes against Syria would further fuel extremism and result in widespread atrocities by the rebels against Syrians of all faiths .
fourth , America ’ s decision to back extremists in Syria contradicts its “ war on terrorism ” and will erode international support for it . the prospect of Iranian cooperation to root out Al Qaeda extremists , which it provided in Afghanistan and Iraq , would be unlikely following any intervention .
fifth , it is wrong to assume that without Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , Iran would lose its influence in the Muslim world as well as its link to Hezbollah in Lebanon . America ’ s regional position weakened , and Iran ’ s strengthened , following the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq ;
sixth , a US attack on Syria would leave the US isolated internationally and end any hope of a diplomatic resolution . there is no domestic or international appetite for another US military adventure – NATO , the G-20 , the Europeans , Russia , China , and 60 % of Americans oppose a unilateral US military strike .
seventh , the civilian casualties arising from a military strike would be high . if the main justification for an attack is humanitarian – to end the senseless slaughter of Syrian civilians – US military intervention would do more harm than good .
eighth , US involvement in Syria will breathe new life into efforts to press for a wider war between the US and Iran . Al Qaeda affiliates will target US regional interests in the hope that the blame falls on Iran and its militant proxies – providing a pretext for US military confrontation .
ninth , a US military strike against a third Muslim-majority country would demolish the credibility of Obama ’ s efforts to repair America ’ s image in the Islamic world . indeed , it would most likely prove to be a strategic boon to the “ resistance axis ” – Iran and Hezbollah .
tenth , any US unilateral military strike against Syria would ratchet up tensions between the US and Russia . this , in turn , would strengthen the Russia-Iran alliance .
eleventh , Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued permission for President Hassan Rouhani ’ s new administration to enter into direct talks with the US . no better opportunity to end decades of bilateral hostility is likely to come along .
finally , with the moderate Rouhani now installed as President , a US military strike could undermine a golden opportunity for America and Iran to reach a face-saving solution ( for both sides ) on Iran ’ s nuclear program .
indeed , Iran was a major victim of chemical-weapons attacks during its 1980-1988 war with Saddam Hussein ’ s Iraq . Iran can be a major partner to halt proliferation of WMDs in Syria , the Middle East , and beyond .
Iran maintains that the Security Council is the only body legally authorized to verify allegations concerning the use of such deadly weapons and to decide on the appropriate response . one promising avenue for US-Iran cooperation on Syria could be joint support for a fact-finding mission by the Security Council to identify the perpetrators .
why Pay More for Fairness ?
marks &amp; Spencer , a supermarket and clothing chain with 400 stores throughout Britain , recently announced that it is converting its entire range of coffee and tea , totaling 38 lines , to Fairtrade , a marketing symbol of “ ethical production . ” The chain already sells only Fairtrade tea and coffee in its 200 Café Revive coffee shops .
the movement toward more ethical consumption has made significant gains in the United States as well , as consumers increasingly turn to organic , locally produced foods , and eggs from hens not kept in cages . in the UK , a survey has found that half of those shown the Fairtrade symbol recognized it and understood that it refers to products that give a better deal for Third World farmers .
traders seeking Fairtrade certification must pay producers a price that covers the costs of sustainable production and provides a living wage . for example , the minimum price for coffee is $ 1.26 per pound , no matter how low the market price may fall .
small farmers , for their part , are required to be organized in cooperatives or other groups that allow democratic participation . plantations and factories can use the Fairtrade label if they pay their workers decent wages , comply with health , safety , and environmental standards , allow unions or other forms of workers ’ associations , provide good housing if workers are not living at home , and do not use child labor or forced labor .
not every one approves of Fairtrade . brink Lindsey , director of the pro-market Cato Institute ’ s Center for Trade Policy Studies , believes that the campaign for Fairtrade coffee is a “ well-meaning dead end . ”
in Lindsey ’ s view , if we want to assist coffee growers , we should encourage them either to abandon coffee and produce more profitable crops – and here he rightly points to rich nations ’ trade barriers and subsidies as obstacles that must be dismantled – or to move into higher-value products , like specialty coffees , that bring higher prices .
economists might reply that if you want to help people feed and educate their children , you can pay $ 10 for a pound of non-Fairtrade coffee that tastes the same and give the $ 2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children .
if their product sells well , they can take pride in having produced something that is sought after around the world . from the growers ’ perspective , receiving a premium by selling a Fairtrade product is preferable to receiving a charitable handout that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of what they produce .
fortunately , in Europe , that market demand is growing rapidly . one hopes that it will soon reach similar levels throughout the developed world , and wherever people can make choices about their discretionary spending .
why Putin Makes a Bad Ally
Stanford – Russian President Vladimir Putin ’ s intervention in the Syrian conflict has been welcomed by some as a moment for the Kremlin to “ come in from the cold . ” Russia ’ s conflict with the Islamic State , the argument goes , has aligned the country ’ s interests with those of the West .
indeed , at a recent press conference , US President Barack Obama again urged Putin to join the alliance against the Islamic State . and French President François Hollande billed his recent visit to Moscow as an effort to build a broad international coalition against the terrorist group .
the country has suffered horrific terrorist attacks by Islamist extremists , including the bombing in November of a plane above the Sinai Peninsula , which killed 224 passengers and crew , nearly all of them Russian . around 20 million Muslims , most of them Sunni , live within the Russian Federation , and the country ’ s security officials report that some 7,000 fighters from the former Soviet republics and Russia have joined the Islamic State .
he has intervened to save the regime of Russia ’ s client , Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . Putin may sometimes give the appearance that he is ready to abandon Assad , but ultimately he will defend him .
ordinary Russians may be in danger of attacks by Islamic extremists , but they pose little threat to Putin or his allies . Russia has indeed suffered a number of terrorist attacks , including the 2004 Beslan massacre , in which 334 people , most of them schoolchildren , were killed .
it has interior ministry troops , federal security agency ( FSB ) special forces , OMON ( mobile special service ) troops , military intelligence troops , and a vast network of internal spies and informants . regime opponents are not allowed to run for office , their rights to demonstrate are restricted , and they are subject to a legal arbitrariness in the courts .
Putin ’ s Russia has swung to one extreme of the spectrum , while the United States and Europe ( despite the protests of civil libertarians ) have chosen to occupy the other end . indeed , Russia is an example of the upper limit of what state power can do to control terrorist activity .
as the reaction to the attacks in Paris illustrates , the seemingly random murder of 130 civilians has monumental resonance in the West – especially when the religious and ideological motives are difficult to understand . but the Kremlin places a lower value on human lives than Western societies do .
the Russian people might be horrified and frightened . but the Russian regime is primarily concerned with its own survival – and with how it might use the public ’ s horror to its benefit .
hard to be Easing
new YORK – The United States Federal Reserve ’ s decision to undertake a third round of quantitative easing , or QE3 , has raised three important questions . will QE3 jump-start America ’ s anemic economic growth ?
after all , while the previous rounds of US monetary easing have been associated with a persistent increase in equity prices , the size and duration of QE3 are more substantial . but , despite the Fed ’ s impressive commitment to aggressive monetary easing , its effects on the real economy and on US equities could well be smaller and more fleeting than those of previous QE rounds .
even during QE2 , in the summer of 2010 , the S &amp; amp ; P 500 , P / E ratios , and EPS were much lower than they are today . if , as is likely , economic growth in the US remains anemic in spite of QE3 , top-line revenues and bottom-line earnings will turn south , with negative effects on equity valuations .
moreover , fiscal support is absent this time : QE1 and QE2 helped to prevent a deeper recession and avoid a double dip , respectively , because each was associated with a significant fiscal stimulus . in contrast , QE3 will be associated with a fiscal contraction , possibly even a large fiscal cliff .
in both 2010 and 2011 , leading economic indicators showed that the first-half slowdown had bottomed out , and that growth was already accelerating before the announcement of monetary easing . thus , QE nudged along an economy that was already recovering , which prolonged asset reflation .
by contrast , the latest data suggest that the US economy is performing as sluggishly now as it was in the first half of the year . indeed , if anything , weakness in the US labor market , low capital expenditures , and slow income growth have contradicted signals in the early summer that third-quarter growth might be more robust .
meanwhile , the main transmission channels of monetary stimulus to the real economy – the bond , credit , currency , and stock markets – remain weak , if not broken . indeed , the bond-market channel is unlikely to boost growth .
the credit channel also is not working properly , as banks have hoarded most of the extra liquidity from QE , creating excess reserves rather than increasing lending . those who can borrow have ample cash and are cautious about spending , while those who want to borrow – highly indebted households and firms ( especially small and medium-size enterprises ) – face a credit crunch .
with global growth weakening , net exports are unlikely to improve robustly , even with a weaker dollar . moreover , many major central banks are implementing variants of QE alongside the Fed , dampening the effect of the Fed ’ s actions on the dollar ’ s value .
perhaps most important , a weaker dollar ’ s effect on the trade balance , and thus on growth , is limited by two factors . first , a weaker dollar is associated with a higher dollar price for commodities , which implies a drag on the trade balance , because the US is a net commodity-importing country .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has recently emphasized the importance of an additional channel : the confidence channel , through which the Fed ’ s commitment to maintaining generous monetary conditions for longer could improve private spending . the issue is how substantial and durable such effects will be .
in short , QE3 reduces the tail risk of an outright economic contraction , but is unlikely to lead to a sustained recovery in an economy that is still enduring a painful deleveraging process . in the short run , QE3 will lead investors to take on risk , and will stimulate modest asset reflation .
Shinzo Abe ’ s Monetary-Policy Delusions
new HAVEN – The politicization of central banking continues unabated . the resurrection of Shinzo Abe and Japan ’ s Liberal Democratic Party – pillars of the political system that has left the Japanese economy mired in two lost decades and counting – is just the latest case in point .
he argued that a timid BOJ should learn from its more aggressive counterparts , the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank . just as the Fed and the ECB have apparently saved the day through their unconventional and aggressive quantitative easing ( QE ) , goes the argument , Abe believes it is now time for the BOJ to do the same .
it certainly looks as if he will get his way . with BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa ’ s term ending in April , Abe will be able to select a successor – and two deputy governors as well – to do his bidding .
nearly four years after the world hit bottom in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , QE ’ s impact has been strikingly asymmetric . while massive liquidity injections were effective in unfreezing credit markets and arrested the worst of the crisis – witness the role of the Fed ’ s first round of QE in 2009-2010 – subsequent efforts have not sparked anything close to a normal cyclical recovery .
hobbled by severe damage to private and public-sector balance sheets , and with policy interest rates at or near zero , post-bubble economies have been mired in a classic “ liquidity trap . ” They are more focused on paying down massive debt overhangs built up before the crisis than on assuming new debt and boosting aggregate demand .
in the years leading up to the crisis , two bubbles – property and credit – &amp; # 160 ; fueled a record-high personal-consumption binge . when the bubbles burst , households understandably became fixated on balance-sheet repair – namely , paying down debt and rebuilding personal savings , rather than resuming excessive spending habits .
indeed , notwithstanding an unprecedented post-crisis tripling of Fed assets to roughly $ 3 trillion – probably on their way to $ 4 trillion over the next year – US consumers have pulled back as never before . in the 19 quarters since the start of 2008 , annualized growth of inflation-adjusted consumer spending has averaged just 0.7 % – almost three percentage points below the 3.6 % trend increases recorded in the 11 years ending in 2006 .
nor does the ECB have reason to be gratified with its strain of quantitative easing . despite a doubling of its balance sheet , to a little more than € 3 trillion ( $ 4 trillion ) , Europe has slipped back into recession for the second time in four years .
not only is QE ’ s ability to jumpstart crisis-torn , balance-sheet-constrained economies limited ; it also runs the important risk of blurring the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy . central banks that buy sovereign debt issued by fiscal authorities offset market-imposed discipline on borrowing costs , effectively subsidizing public-sector profligacy .
unfortunately , it appears that Japan has forgotten many of its own lessons – especially the BOJ ’ s disappointing experience with zero interest rates and QE in the early 2000 ’ s . but it has also lost sight of the 1990 ’ s – the first of its so-called lost decades – when the authorities did all they could to prolong the life of insolvent banks and many nonfinancial corporations .
from quantitative easing to record-high federal budget deficits to unprecedented bailouts , they have done everything in their power to mask the pain of balance-sheet repair and structural adjustment . as a result , America has created its own generation of zombies – in this case , zombie consumers .
household debt stood at 112 % of income in the third quarter of 2012 – down from record highs in 2006 , but still nearly 40 percentage points above the 75 % norm of the last three decades of the twentieth century . similarly , the personal-saving rate , at just 3.5 % in the four months ending in November 2012 , was less than half the 7.9 % average of 1970-99 .
the ECB ’ s über-aggressive actions have achieved little in the way of bringing about long-awaited structural transformation in the region . crisis-torn peripheral European economies still suffer from unsustainable debt loads and serious productivity and competitiveness problems .
the last thing that the Japanese economy needs at this point is backsliding on structural reforms . yet , by forcing the BOJ to follow in the misdirected footsteps of the Fed and the ECB , that is precisely the risk that Abe and Japan are facing .
massive liquidity injections carried out by the world ’ s major central banks – the Fed , the ECB , and the BOJ – are neither achieving traction in their respective real economies , nor facilitating balance-sheet repair and structural change . that leaves a huge sum of excess liquidity sloshing around in global asset markets .
why Remember Pearl Harbor ?
over the years , “ the day of infamy ” has become a classic reference point for galvanizing patriotic sentiment in America . in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attack , for example , analogies to Pearl Harbor were made frequently .
the decision to attack Pearl Harbor was reached after five months of deliberations that included numerous official conferences . it was a gradual process in which more sympathetic , albeit firm , US engagement might have helped sway Japan in a different direction .
others saw the US as the primary enemy . some were concerned with more abstract , ideological enemies , such as Communism and “ Americanism , ” while there were also voices highlighting the menace of the “ white race ” ( including Japan ’ s allies , Germany and Italy ) against the “ yellow race . ”
then there were those who preferred not to fight any enemy at all , particularly the US , whose long-term war-making power , the government knew , far surpassed Japan ’ s own . the tactical mastermind of the Pearl Harbor operation , Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto , was one of them .
Germany ’ s attack on the Soviet Union compelled Japan in July 1941 to prepare a plan of attack . although it made clear Japan ’ s desire to take advantage of the European conflict and gain a foothold in the European colonies in Southeast Asia , the plan was not clear about who constituted Japan ’ s true enemy .
rather than telling Japan that the US was determined to search for a diplomatic solution , America ’ s categorical reaction confirmed it to the Japanese as an arrogant and conceited enemy . moreover , by transferring its Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor , the US encouraged the Japanese understanding that the US fully anticipated war with Japan .
but it was , above all , the sense of encirclement and humiliation that united the deeply divided Japanese government . feeling defeated by a series of failed approaches to the US , including an overture to hold direct talks with Roosevelt , Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe resigned on October 16 , making hard-line Army Minister Hideki Tōjō his successor .
the high-handed tone of the Hull Note of November 26 , demanding Japan ’ s withdrawal of all its troops from China , was a final blow to the moderates in Japan ’ s government , who still hoped for diplomatic negotiations . by this time , many policymakers were convinced that the US was not ready to hear them out .
coupled with the economic hardship of the interwar years were instances of racial prejudice in the US that aimed at preventing Japanese immigration . United by this long-simmering and humiliating sense of exclusion , Japanese policymakers , whatever their differences , stumbled toward the December 1 decision to go to war .
despite obvious differences between Pearl Harbor and recent Islamist terrorist tactics , they show the common desire of self-proclaimed Davids to topple their Goliaths in a clearly lop-sided battle . these Davids depend on Western technologies to overcome imbalances of power , and are driven by a sense of real or imagined humiliation .
but no matter how strong and historically justified such grievances may be those who resort to murderous tactics must be condemned . however , high-handedness and tough talk alone are an inadequate response , for this approach further humiliates those who already feel humiliated , and alienates those who might otherwise proffer a more moderate voice .
America ’ s Global Election
new YORK – Most people around the world will not be able to vote in the United States ’ s upcoming presidential election , even though they have a great deal at stake in the result . overwhelmingly , non-US citizens favor Barack Obama ’ s re-election over a victory for his challenger , Mitt Romney .
many governments quickly subscribed to Ronald Reagan ’ s mantra of deregulated markets – policies that eventually brought about the worst global recession since the 1930 ’ s . other countries that followed America ’ s lead have experienced growing inequality – &amp; nbsp ; more money at the top , more poverty at the bottom , and a weaker middle class .
many people attribute these failures partly to an absence of American leadership . but , while Romney may summon bravado and strong rhetoric , other world leaders would be unlikely to follow him , owing to the belief ( correct in my judgment ) that he would take the US – and them – in the wrong direction .
American “ exceptionalism ” may sell well at home , but it does poorly abroad . President George W. Bush ’ s Iraq war – arguably a violation of international law – &amp; nbsp ; showed that though America spends almost as much on defense as the rest of the world combined , it could not pacify a country with less than 10 % of its population and less than 1 % of its GDP .
moreover , it turned out that US-style capitalism was neither efficient nor stable . with most Americans ’ incomes stagnating for a decade and a half , it was clear that the US economic model was not delivering for most citizens , whatever official GDP data said .
in terms of values – namely , the values of Romney and his running mate , Paul Ryan – things are not much better . for example , every other advanced country recognizes the right to accessible health care , and Obama ’ s Affordable Care Act represents a significant step toward that goal .
and Romney ’ s drastic budget cutbacks , targeted at the poor and middle class , would further impede social mobility . at the same time , he would expand the military , spending more money on weapons that do not work against enemies that do not exist , enriching defense contractors like Halliburton at the expense of desperately needed public investment in infrastructure and education .
while Bush is not on the ballot , Romney has not really distanced himself from the Bush administration ’ s policies . on the contrary , his campaign has featured the same advisers , the same devotion to higher military spending , the same belief that tax cuts for the rich are the solution to every economic problem , and the same fuzzy budget math .
consider , for example , the three issues that are at the center of the global agenda mentioned earlier : climate change , financial regulation , and trade . Romney has been silent on the first , and many in his party are “ climate deniers . ”
as for financial regulation , while the recent crisis has highlighted the need for stricter rules , agreement on many issues has proven to be elusive , partly because the Obama administration is too close to the financial sector . with Romney , though , there would be no distance at all : metaphorically speaking , he is the financial sector .
one financial issue on which there is global agreement is the need to close down offshore bank havens , which exist mainly for purposes of tax evasion and avoidance , money laundering , and corruption . money does not go to the Cayman Islands because sunshine makes it grow faster ; this money thrives on the absence of sunshine .
on trade , Romney promises to launch a trade war with China , and to declare it a currency manipulator on Day One – a promise that gives him little wiggle room . he refuses to note the renminbi ’ s large real appreciation in recent years , or to acknowledge that , while changes in China ’ s exchange rate may affect the bilateral trade deficit , what matters is America ’ s multilateral trade deficit .
the irony – &amp; nbsp ; again lost on Romney – is that other countries are accusing the US of currency manipulation . after all , one of the main benefits of the Federal Reserve ’ s policy of “ quantitative easing ” – perhaps the only channel with a significant effect on the real economy – derives from the depreciation of the US dollar .
the world has a lot riding on America ’ s election . unfortunately , most people who will be affected by it – almost the entire world – will have no influence on the outcome .
the Battle Cry of the Non-Oppressed
in the past , regions or communities have achieved statehood almost exclusively after a struggle against colonial subjection and oppression , galvanized by an appeal to a distinctive religious , cultural , or ethnic identity . complaints about economic dynamics , social policies , or governance inefficiencies – the basis of Scotland ’ s “ yes ” campaign – are not the cris de coeur of a successful independence movement .
as the movement ’ s leader , Alex Salmond , acknowledged in a 2012 consultation document , “ Scotland is not oppressed and we have no need to be liberated . ” The struggle for independence , he explained , was aimed at creating the kind of efficient administrative and economic structures that would enable Scotland to reach its potential .
the “ yes ” campaign hoped to win supporters with a utopian vision of an independent Scotland that included European Union and NATO membership ; a currency union with England , but no fiscal union ; improved public services and social benefits ; and lower taxes . in other words , Scotland would have everything it has now , only better , and on its own terms .
but it proved significantly less compelling than the economic doomsday scenarios advanced by its unionist opponents , including former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , former World Bank President Robert Zoellick , and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne . in other words , many people ’ s votes were driven by risk aversion , fear , and intimidation , rather than hope , passion , or deep emotional attachment to a common identity .
this contrasts sharply with the motivations espoused by Scotland ’ s nobles in the fourteenth century , when they succeeded in preserving their country ’ s independence from English rule . “ It is in truth not for glory , nor riches , nor honors that we are fighting , ” they declared , “ but for freedom alone , which no honest man gives up but with life itself . ”
in fact , the “ no ” campaign ’ s victory might have been even more resounding if the Westminster establishment ’ s desperate , last-minute offer to grant Scotland more powers on taxation , spending , and welfare had been included as an option in the ballot . national movements driven by a historical mission or an uncompromising quest to assert group identity against a dominant power normally do not succumb to economic considerations and last-minute economic bait .
it was none other than the founder of the Zionist fundamentalist right , Ze ’ ev Jabotinsky , who warned in 1924 against “ the naive assumption that the aspiration of the Palestinians &amp; hellip ; will be paralyzed by such means as subsidies , economic advantages , or bribery . ” Recognizing that their “ natural patriotism is pure and noble , ” he knew that they could not be “ bought off . ”
now , Salmond is probably re-thinking his avoidance of nativist identity politics . what Edmund Burke defined as &amp; nbsp ; a group ’ s attachment to “ the inns and resting places of the human spirit ” – that is , ethnic , religious , and community ties – would have been a much more powerful mobilizing force for an independence movement .
James Joyce – himself not devoid of traces of Irish nationalism – wrote that “ nationality , language , religion ” are “ the nets ” into which “ a man is born . ” Similarly , George Orwell distinguished between Celtic nationalism and Anglophobia , stating that the former is belief “ in the past and future greatness of the Celtic peoples . ”
in the run-up to the referendum , Scotland ’ s independence movement became an important point of reference for Catalans and Basques in Spain , the Flemish in Belgium , the Veneto and South Tyrol regions in Italy , Corsicans and Bretons in France , and the secessionists of Quebec . all hoped that Scotland would pave the way for the peaceful breakup of their own states .
with the defeat of Scotland ’ s independence movement – not to mention Québécois voters ’ stunning rejection of the province ’ s largest separatist party in last April ’ s election – that hope may be waning . and with good reason .
a state is far more likely to go to war to defend its unity . the United States and Spain did it in their civil wars , and today ’ s Spain would go to the outer limits of its capacity to prevent a Catalan or Basque referendum , let alone independence .
theirs is the nationalism of free , liberated people , who can expect the most generous devolution deals possible to protect their singular legacies and address their grievances . and perhaps that is why federal arrangements like those in Australia and Canada – essentially what Westminster grudgingly offered Scotland – could be their best option .
long Live China ’ s Slowdown
while the data were hardly devastating relative to a consensus forecast of 8.2 % , many ( including me ) expected a second consecutive quarterly rebound from the slowdown that appeared to have ended in the third quarter of 2012 . China doubters around the world were quick to pounce on the number , expressing fears of a stall , or even a dreaded double dip .
but slower GDP growth is actually good for China , provided that it reflects the long-awaited structural transformation of the world ’ s most dynamic economy . the broad outlines of this transformation are well known – a shift from export- and investment-led growth to an economic structure that draws greater support from domestic private consumption .
a rebalanced China can grow more slowly for one simple reason : by drawing increased support from services-led consumer demand , China ’ s new model will embrace a more labor-intensive growth recipe . the numbers seem to bear that out .
that number has potentially huge implications , because it means that China could grow at an annual rate in the 7-8 % range and still achieve its objectives with respect to employment and poverty reduction . China has struggled to attain these goals with anything less than 10 % growth , because the old model was not generating enough jobs per unit of output .
ultimately , that became more of a problem than a solution . the old manufacturing model , which fueled an unprecedented 20-fold increase in per capita income relative to the early 1990 ’ s , also sowed the seeds of excessive resource consumption and environmental degradation .
services-led growth is , in many ways , the antidote to the “ unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and ultimately unsustainable ” growth model that former Premier Wen Jiabao ’ s famously criticized in 2007 . yet services offer more than just a labor-intensive growth path .
not surprisingly , China skeptics are putting a different spin on the latest growth numbers . fears of a shadow-bank-induced credit bubble now top the worry list , reinforcing longstanding concerns that China may succumb to the dreaded “ middle-income trap ” – a sustained growth slowdown that has ensnared most high-growth emerging economies at the juncture that China has now reached .
invariably , the middle-income trap afflicts those emerging economies that cling to early-stage development models for too long . for China , the risk will be highest if it sticks with the timeworn recipe of unbalanced manufacturing- and construction-led growth , which has created such serious sustainability problems .
if China fails to rebalance , weak external demand from a crisis-battered developed world will continue to hobble its export machine , forcing it to up the ante on a credit- and investment-led growth model – in effect , doubling down on resource-intensive and environmentally damaging growth . but I remain hopeful that China ’ s new leadership team will move quickly to implement its new model .
financial markets , as well as growth-starved developed economies , are not thrilled with the natural rhythm of slower growth that a rebalanced Chinese economy is likely to experience . resource industries – indeed , resource-based economies like Australia , Canada , Brazil , and Russia – have become addicted to China ’ s old strain of unsustainable hyper-growth .
the United States is likely to have a different problem with consumer-led growth in China . after all , higher private consumption implies an end to China ’ s surplus saving – and thus to the seemingly open-ended recycling of that surplus into dollar-based assets such as US Treasury bills .
just as China must embrace slower growth as a natural consequence of its rebalancing imperative , the rest of the world will need to figure out how to cope when it does .
why Small Booms Cause Big Busts
in other words , a relatively small amount of overinvestment is responsible for some $ 1.8 trillion in lost production every year . given that the gap shows no signs of closing , and accounting for expected growth rates and equity returns , I estimate that the total loss to production will eventually reach nearly $ 3 quadrillion .
financial blows in 1987 , 1991 , 1997 , 1998 , and 2001 ( when some $ 4 trillion of excess investment was lost when the dot-com bubble burst ) had little impact on the broader real economy . the reason why things were different this time can be found in a recently published paper by Òscar Jordà , Moritz Schularick , and Alan M. Taylor .
when the bubble is in equity prices , the economy performs 4 % below par , on average , after five years – and as much as 9 % below par when the bubble is in the housing market . given these findings , it is clear that the distress experienced since the beginning of the economic crisis is not far out of line with historical experience .
a few years later , Keynes proposed a fix to the problem . in The General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money , Keynes explained how booms are created when “ investments which will in fact yield , say , 2 % in conditions of full employment are made in the expectation of a yield of , say , 6 % and are valued accordingly . ”
the result is a self-fulfilling prophecy , in which widespread unemployment does indeed drive the returns of those investments below zero . “ We reach a condition where there is a shortage of houses , ” Keynes wrote , “ but where nevertheless no one can afford to live in the houses that there are . ”
his solution was simple : “ The right remedy for the trade cycle is not to be found in abolishing booms and thus keeping us permanently in a semi-slump ; but in abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi-boom . ” For Keynes , the underlying problem was a failure of the economy ’ s credit channels .
and the third is tight restrictions on debt and leverage , especially in the housing market , in order to prevent a credit-fueled price bubble from forming . to these solutions , Keynes would have added a fourth , one known to us today as the “ Greenspan put ” – using monetary policy to validate the asset prices reached at the height of the bubble .
unfortunately , in a world in which fiscal austerity appears to exert a mesmerizing hold over politicians , and in which a 2 % inflation target seems set in stone , our policy options are rather limited . and that , ultimately , is how a relatively small boom can lead to such a large bust .
rebalancing the State ’ s Balance Sheet
measurement and reporting were neglected . even today , states ’ liabilities receive considerable attention , while their asset sides receive significantly less .
in an earlier era , states owned substantial industrial assets . this “ commanding heights of the economy ” model was rejected largely because it seriously under-performed , especially when state-owned sectors were protected from competition ( as was the norm ) .
the theory , in Europe and elsewhere , was that states could not be impartial owners of industrial assets . through regulation , public procurement , and hidden subsidies , they would favor their own assets .
regulations in a range of countries , from Japan to Italy , create sectors that are sheltered from competition , with detrimental effects on productivity . this pattern is particularly pronounced in the non-tradable sectors ( which account for two-thirds of the economy ) , where the discipline of foreign competition is absent by definition .
it is important that more attention is now paid to public liabilities – not only growing sovereign debt , but also larger , non-debt liabilities embedded in social-insurance programs . a combination of defective growth models , rising longevity , and unanticipated increases in costs ( such as health care in America ) have caused these longer-term liabilities to explode .
reining in debt and other liabilities has substantially reduced governments ’ scope for sustaining demand in the face of severe negative shocks , thus reducing their ability to buy time for structural adjustment in the private sector . for now , investment in a shift to a sustainable growth and employment pattern has been crowded out .
many have public pension funds of substantial magnitude , consisting of diversified portfolios of assets . these assets are , in a sense , spoken for – there are claims on them in the form of liabilities , which have grown as expected risk-adjusted returns on assets decline ; but they do represent a partial funding of public liabilities and are an element of resilience .
by contrast , in China , the asset side of the state balance sheet is very large : land , foreign-currency reserves of $ 3.5 trillion , and around an 85 % stake in state-owned enterprises that account for about 40 % of output . this balance-sheet configuration has helped China to respond to shocks and sustain high levels of public-sector investment .
in the best case – without a sharp decline in financial assets accelerating an economic downturn , a sudden collapse of a defective growth model , or even rapid increases in liabilities associated with demographic shifts or health-care technology – it might make sense to focus only on controlling liabilities . but a best-case scenario provides a poor policy framework in our imperfect world .
in fact , states are routinely called upon to deal with a wide range of market failures or limitations : unsustainable growth patterns and regulatory myopia ; distributional problems associated with the evolution of technology and globalization ; accelerating concentration of national income ; and major structural transitions associated with shocks and secular trends in technology and the global economy .
here is the dilemma : governments with substantial assets have flexibility and the capacity to act , but they can also mismanage their assets to the detriment of markets and economic dynamism . in China , where the asset side of the balance sheet is large , the strategy of shrinking it via privatization has been largely rejected , at least for now .
that leads to the challenge of effective management of public assets – management that promotes rather than impedes market efficiency and innovation .
for developed countries , increasing resilience and flexibility over time by building public assets should be a long-term priority . periodic systemic risk affects entire economies and public finances , not only financial markets , and governments should be able to respond during periods of rapid structural change .
first , once a collective choice is made about the desired levels of social insurance , the implied liabilities should be fully funded over time . the alternative is a poor intergenerational burden-sharing choice .
second , governments , like individuals , households , and businesses , need to save for a rainy day . that is all the more important in periods – like the current one – of rapid change , high volatility , and only partly predictable systemic instability .
why Support the TPP ?
Cambridge – Agreement among negotiators from 12 Pacific Rim countries on the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) represents a triumph over long odds . tremendous political obstacles , both domestic and international , had to be overcome to conclude the deal .
the left ’ s unremitting hostility to the deal – often on the grounds that the US Congress was kept in the dark about its content during negotiations – carried two dangers . a worthwhile effort could have been blocked , or President Barack Obama ’ s Democratic administration could have been compelled to be more generous to American corporations , in order to pick up needed votes from Republicans .
the agreement gives pharmaceutical firms , tobacco companies , and other corporations substantially less than they had asked for – so much so that US Senator Orrin Hatch and some other Republicans now threaten to oppose ratification . likewise , the deal gives environmentalists more than they had bothered to ask for .
perhaps some of these outcomes were the result of hard bargaining by other trading partners ( such as Australia ) . regardless , the TPP ’ s critics should now read the specifics that they have so long said they wanted to see and reconsider their opposition to the deal .
the most controversial issues in the US are those that are sometimes classified as “ deep integration , ” because they go beyond the traditional easing of trade tariffs and quotas . the left ’ s concerns about labor and the environment were accompanied by fears about excessive benefits for corporations : protection of the intellectual property of pharmaceutical and other companies , and the mechanisms used to settle disputes between investors and states .
the agreement includes substantial steps to enforce the prohibitions contained in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) . it also takes substantial steps to limit subsidies for fishing fleets – which in many countries waste taxpayer money and accelerate the depletion of marine life .
I wish that certain environmental groups had devoted half as much time and energy ascertaining the potential for such good outcomes as they did to sweeping condemnations of the negotiating process . the critics apparently were too busy to notice when the agreement on fishing subsidies was reached in Maui in July .
similarly , various provisions in the area of labor practices , particularly in Southeast Asia , are progressive . these include measures to promote union rights in Vietnam and steps to crack down on human trafficking in Malaysia .
perhaps the greatest uncertainty concerned the extent to which big US corporations would get what they wanted in the areas of investor-government dispute settlement and intellectual property protection . the TPP ’ s critics often neglected to acknowledge that international dispute-settlement mechanisms could ever serve a valid purpose , or that some degree of patent protection is needed if pharmaceutical companies are to have sufficient incentive to invest in research and development .
there was , of course , a danger that such protections for corporations could go too far . the dispute-settlement provisions might have interfered unreasonably with member countries ’ anti-smoking campaigns , for example .
likewise , the intellectual property protections might have established a 12-year monopoly on the data that US pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies compile on new drugs ( particularly biologics ) , thereby impeding competition from lower-cost generic versions . in the end , these companies did not get all they wanted ; while the TPP in some ways gives their intellectual property more protection than they had before , it assures protection of their data for only 5-8 years .
countries like Japan have agreed to let in more dairy products , sugar , beef , and rice from more efficient producers in countries like New Zealand and Australia . in all these areas and more , traditional textbook arguments about the gains from trade apply : new export opportunities lead to higher wages and a lower cost of living .
many citizens and politicians made up their minds about TPP long ago , based on seemingly devastating critiques of what might emerge from the negotiations . they should now look at the outcome with an open mind .
Europe ’ s Non-Deal of the Century
for several years , EU leaders have been urging the consolidation of Europe ’ s defense industries , so the proposed deal – which originated in the corporate boardrooms of EADS and BAE Systems – looked like an answer to their calls . yet both the Commission and the European Parliament kept silent and withheld the political support that might have ensured that the deal went through .
a timely reminder by EU leaders of the strategic importance of the aerospace sector would have helped allay many of the misgivings in Berlin , and to a lesser degree in London , that ultimately sank the deal . aviation , like defense , is the sharpest of the R &amp; amp ; D cutting edges available to advanced countries , and regularly produces key technological breakthroughs .
why , then , did the European Commission remain silent ? the answer appears to be that it feared negative reactions from the three governments involved in the merger talks , and believed that its own authority would suffer from any public rebuff .
whether true or not , the important point is that the merger transcended national considerations , and the European Commission had a duty to involve itself . the EU ’ s executive body is meant to be the driving force behind Europe ’ s efforts to revive laggard industries and fight to reverse the long-term economic decline that the eurozone crisis appears to presage .
nobody is arguing that the Commission is responsible for the deal ’ s unhappy end – only that it should have rallied support for it . the significance of the merger ’ s collapse is now becoming clear to observers across Europe , especially in Germany , where the media have been extremely critical of how “ negative politics ” sealed the proposed merger ’ s fate .
with the EU in the throes of the seemingly endless eurozone sovereign-debt crisis and facing a looming debate over its future decision-making architecture , the collapse of the EADS-BAE merger will be no more than a footnote in the history books . but it may be said to mark the point when the European Commission openly acknowledged that it has become little more than a secretariat to EU governments .
Mario Draghi ’ s Opiate of the Markets
Italy ’ s parliament is divided among three mutually incompatible political forces , with none strong enough to rule alone . worse , one of these forces , which won 25 % of the vote , is an anti-euro populist party , while another , a Euro-skeptic group led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , received close to 30 % support , giving anti-euro parties a clear majority .
despite these scary results , the interest-rate spread for Italian government bonds relative to German bunds has increased by only 40 basis points since the election . in July 2012 , when a pro-European , austerity-minded government was running the country , with the well-respected economist Mario Monti in charge , the spread reached 536 basis points .
Forty-six percent of the respondents said that the most likely outcome for Italy is an interim administration and new elections . and they regard this outcome as the worst-case scenario , one that implies a delay of any further economic measures , deep policy uncertainty , and the risk of an even less favorable electoral outcome .
although investors believe that the backstop is unlikely to be used , its mere presence dissuades them from betting against Italy . in other words , the “ outright monetary transactions ” ( OMT ) scheme announced by ECB President Mario Draghi last July has served as the proverbial “ bazooka ” – a gun so powerful that it does not need to be used .
not falling for the trick , speculators repeatedly called his bluff . Draghi , with his famous pledge to do “ whatever it takes ” to ensure the euro ’ s survival , succeeded where Paulson did not .
Draghi designed it to relieve the ECB of the huge political responsibility of deciding when to save a country from default . for this reason , triggering the OMT mechanism requires the unanimous consent of eurozone governments .
its presence is enough to support a benign self-fulfilling prophecy . in other words , Draghi ’ s bazooka has anesthetized markets , impairing their ability to assess risk .
but as with all anesthetics , Draghi ’ s cannot and will not last forever . either the underlying problem is fixed before the patient wakes up , or the pain will be devastating .
I believe that it is higher than 50 % . even after Germany ’ s election , I am not sure that the government will be willing to support an Italian rescue program without asking for major guarantees concerning the objectives – and even the composition – of Italy ’ s ruling coalition .
indeed , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will face a serious dilemma following her likely re-election . without strict conditionality , she would risk shifting the domestic consensus in favor of Germany ’ s emerging Euro-skeptic mood .
the only hope is that the eurozone makes strong progress toward establishing fiscal-redistribution mechanisms , such as European unemployment insurance , before Draghi ’ s anesthetic wears off . otherwise , Europe will face a very rude awakening indeed .
why the Fed Should Postpone Rate Hikes
Jackson HOLE , WYOMING – As central bankers from around the world gather this week in Jackson Hole for the Federal Reserve ’ s annual Economic Policy Symposium , one key topic of discussion will be the current global stock-market turmoil . there are many reasons for these gyrations , but the expectation that the Fed will start to raise interest rates – perhaps as early as September – is clearly one of them .
when an economy is normalizing , it is reasonable to reduce expansionary measures , such as those introduced after the crisis of 2008 . because the Fed has clearly communicated that it will move gradually toward less expansionary policies , its credibility would be damaged if it did not follow through .
historically , 3 % growth during a recovery is far from impressive . in other recent recoveries , growth often hit 4 % or even 5 % when increased capacity utilization pushed up productivity and investment .
over the past three decades , the US has been able to grow at an average annual rate of around 2.5 % . some attribute relatively slow growth to demographic factors , which have reduced the labor force , as well as to weak productivity levels , which have been low .
unemployment is down to 5 % , with no signs of overheating . the employment cost index suggests that wage increases so far have been surprisingly low .
one reason for this is that labor-market flexibility increased during the recovery . self-employment , short-term contracts , or part-time arrangements account for many of the jobs that have been created over the past few years .
jobs that require lower skills and less training are particularly vulnerable ; but it is also clear that many other occupational categories – including administration , accounting , logistics , banking , and various service activities – are likely to be affected . companies will be able to reduce their headcount and production costs while improving customer service , which , like Uberization , will affect the wage-setting process .
central bankers , I believe , are underestimating the impact of this structural shift . in the more tech-oriented economies , like the US , the United Kingdom , and the Nordic countries , there is a risk that traditional macroeconomic models will overestimate the cost pressure from labor .
another reason why the Fed should postpone a rate hike is that financial turmoil in emerging markets , particularly China , could have a substantial impact on the global economy , with some clear implications for the US economy . in particular , lower energy and commodity prices are likely to dampen inflationary pressure .
the indirect effect , which might be substantial , is that cost-competitive light manufacturing in emerging markets increases . that would reinforce the deflationary pressure from globalization for years to come .
but , because they flooded global markets with liquidity , large portfolio flows have moved into emerging-market countries , whose currencies often are not as liquid as the dollar . when investment moves back into dollars , the currency fluctuations in these less liquid markets can become excessive .
the Fed clearly has a responsibility to consider how its policy decisions affect the global financial system . excessive currency volatility is not in America ’ s interest , not least because large exchange-rate depreciations in emerging markets would amplify the effects of globalization on US jobs , wages , and inflation , particularly as weaker foreign currencies make outsourcing a more economically viable solution .
another reason for the Fed to reconsider hiking rates is that the legitimacy of the Bretton Woods institutions depends on a well-functioning global financial system . the global economy ’ s center of gravity is moving to Asia , Latin America , and Africa , but the IMF and the World Bank still seem to mirror the reality of the 1950s .
the Fed should regard lower commodity prices , reduced inflationary pressures , changes in the labor market , and further disruptive technological shifts as sufficiently convincing arguments to postpone a rate hike . including the risk of excessive volatility in the global financial system tips the balance even further .
there is plenty of time for the Fed to signal that its policy stance has shifted , and the conclave in Jackson Hole is an excellent opportunity to start that communication . if the facts have changed , the policy implications must also change .
why the Greek Bailout Failed
and without structural reform , there is little chance that the Greek economy will see sustained stability and growth – not least because official lenders are unwilling to continue extending an unreformed Greece significantly more money than it is asked to pay . ( this has been the case through most of the crisis , even if one would never know it from the world press coverage . )
Greece ’ s membership in the European Union gives its creditors significant leverage , but evidently not enough to change the fundamental calculus . Greece remains very much a sovereign country , not a sub-sovereign state .
the best structural-adjustment programs are those in which the debtor country ’ s government proposes the policy changes , and the IMF helps design a bespoke program and provides the political cover for its implementation . imposing them from the outside is simply not an effective option .
back in 2013 , IMF staff wrote a sobering report on the organization ’ s experience in the country . their conclusion , in essence , was that the government ’ s failure to embrace the reform process fully all but guaranteed that its program would not work .
if a government is incapable of or uninterested in making the needed adjustments , the report argued , the best option is to drip money out as reforms are implemented , as is now being done in Greece . unfortunately , that approach has not proved adequate to overcome the challenges there .
left-wing ideologues have long viewed structural-reform programs with deep suspicion , accusing international lenders like the IMF and the World Bank of being captured by neoliberal market fundamentalists . this critique has some truth in it , but is overblown .
but one should not make the mistake of viewing these interventions in black-and-white terms . breaking down dual labor markets that are excluding young workers ( as they do in much of southern Europe , including Italy and , to some extent , France ) is very different from making it easier to fire all workers .
recently , opponents of structural reform have put forward more exotic objections – most notably the problem caused by deflation when policy interest rates are at zero . if structural reforms simply lower all wages and prices , it may indeed be difficult in the short-term to counter the drop in aggregate demand .
if a debt bailout program requires a wholesale change in a country ’ s economic , social , and political model , the best course of action might be to write off the private losses , rather than pour in public money to cover them . in cases like Greece , the creditors ’ passion for structural reforms might be better directed at home – particularly toward improving financial regulation .
but given the difficulty Greece has had so far in making the necessary changes to reach that goal , it might be time to reconsider this approach to the crisis completely . in place of a program providing the country with further loans , it might make more sense to provide outright humanitarian aid – regardless of whether Greece remains fully within the eurozone .
why the Greek Deal Will Work
London – Now that Greek banks have reopened and the government has made scheduled payments to the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund , does Greece ’ s near-death experience mark the end of the euro crisis ? the conventional answer is a clear no .
according to most economists and political commentators , the latest Greek bailout was little more than an analgesic . it will dull the pain for a short period , but the euro ’ s deep-seated problems will metastasize , with a dismal prognosis for the single currency and perhaps even the European Union as a whole .
the deal between Greece and the European authorities is actually a good one for both sides . rather than marking the beginning of a new phase of the euro crisis , the agreement may be remembered as the culmination of a long series of political compromises that , by correcting some of the euro ’ s worst design flaws , created the conditions for a European economic recovery .
to express guarded optimism about the Greek deal is not to condone the provocative arrogance of former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis or the pointless vindictiveness of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble . neither is it to deny the economic criticism of the bailout provisions presented by progressives like Joseph Stiglitz and conservatives like Hans-Werner Sinn .
but this does not mean that breaking up the euro would be desirable , or even tolerable . joining the euro was certainly ruinous for Greece , but there is always “ a great deal of ruin in a nation , ” as Adam Smith remarked 250 years ago , when losing the American colonies seemed to threaten Britain with financial devastation .
the great virtue of capitalism is that it adapts to ruinous conditions and even finds ways of turning them to advantage . the United States in the mid-nineteenth century was badly suited for a single currency and a single economic structure , as evidenced by the Civil War , which was provoked as much by single-currency tensions as by moral abhorrence to slavery .
but once unification has happened , the pain of dismantling the political and economic settlement usually overwhelms the apparent gains from a break-up . this seems to be the case in Europe , as clear majorities of voters are saying in all eurozone countries , including Germany and Greece .
thus , the question was never whether the single currency would break up , but what political reversals , economic sacrifices , and legal subterfuges would occur to hold it together . the good news is that Europe now has some persuasive answers .
moreover , European governments have belatedly understood the most basic principle of public finance . government debts never have to be repaid , provided they can be extended in a cooperative manner or bought up with newly created money , issued by a credible central bank .
finally , Germany , Spain , Italy , and several northern European countries required , for domestic political reasons , a ritual humiliation of radical Greek politicians and voters who openly defied EU institutions and austerity demands . having achieved this , EU leaders have no further reason to impose austerity on Greece or strictly enforce the terms of the latest bailout .
this raises a key issue that the Tsipras government and many others misunderstood throughout the Greek crisis : the role of constructive hypocrisy in Europe ’ s political economy . gaps between public statements and private intentions open up in all political systems , but these become huge in a complex multinational structure like the EU .
moreover , the extension of ECB monetary support to Greece will transform financial conditions : interest rates will plummet , banks will recapitalize , and private credit will gradually become available for the first time since 2010 . if budget targets were strictly enforced by bailout monitors , which seems unlikely , this improvement in conditions for private borrowers could easily compensate for any modest tightening of fiscal policy .
in short , the main conditions now seem to be in place for a sustainable recovery in Greece . conventional wisdom among economists and investors has a long record of failing to spot major turning points ; so the near-universal belief today that Greece faces permanent depression is no reason to despair .
money-market Resistance
Cambridge – The United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) recently rejected proposed rules aimed at making money-market funds safer in a financial crisis – a rejection that has caused consternation among observers and other regulators . given the risks that money market funds can pose to the global financial system , as shown by their destabilizing role in the 2008 financial crisis , it is not hard to see why they are worried .
money-market funds take excess cash from investors and use it to purchase short-term IOUs from businesses , banks , and other financial institutions . they mimic bank accounts by allowing investors to write checks and promise that their investment ’ s value will not fall .
even if the asset pool declines in value , the fund ’ s managers keep the value of each share at $ 1.00 by rounding upward the fund ’ s real value . if the fund ’ s losses are big enough that rounding off still leaves it short of a stable $ 1.00 value , the fund “ breaks the buck . ”
that happened when Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008 . the Reserve Fund , a well-established money-market fund with too many unpaid IOUs from Lehman , could not keep its value steady .
since much of the money-market funds ’ assets are IOUs from the world ’ s biggest banks , the withdrawals weakened the already-shaky global banking system . the Federal Reserve , seeking to stem the growing panic and stabilize the American and international banking system , promptly guaranteed the value of all money-market funds .
the proposals that the SEC rejected were aimed at making money-market funds more robust by requiring that each fund maintain capital reserves or let its value “ float ” – and not be rounded up – to reflect its true , underlying risk . the proposal would also have required that money-market funds hold back a fraction of some redemptions , thereby making investors take some risk that funds might not have complete transactional liquidity if their investments weakened .
if money-market funds had to maintain capital reserves , industry representatives argued , yields to investors would decline and the industry ’ s profits would suffer . and , if retail investors saw their money-market funds ’ values declining from the amount that they had invested , and if they knew that they could not get all of their money back immediately , the funds would become less attractive .
banks are obliged to hold reserves , maintain capital , and pay deposit insurance to ensure that they can honor their deposits . the mutual-fund industry , one can assume , feared that the SEC ’ s rules would induce customers to redirect much of their cash directly into banks .
as a result of the SEC ’ s inaction , money-market funds will continue to operate outside the scope of bank-style rules on capital and reserves , even though investors treat them like bank accounts . unlike banks , though , they do not pay the government to insure their investors .
the rejected proposals are thus good policy : money-market funds should be made safer – via capital requirements and liquidity restrictions – because they already receive a de facto government guarantee . their steady value makes them appear safer to investors than they are to the world ’ s financial system .
the SEC ’ s rejection of the proposed rules demonstrates the power of concerted lobbying – and that concentrated interests often trump diffuse benefits . typically , an interest group lobbies Congress , blandishing persuasive arguments , campaign contributions , and other support ; often enough members – or enough key members – come to see the merit of the group ’ s point of view ( or at least vote as if they do ) .
one might think that banks would counter-balance the mutual-fund industry ’ s lobbying efforts , because the likely effect of forcing money-market funds to pay for more of their systemic costs would be to expand funds flowing directly to banks . but inflows through money-market funds are not so bad for banks , which get the cash without having to set aside reserves or pay for deposit insurance .
so the mutual-fund industry had the regulators all to itself . its lobbyists told the SEC commissioners that current rules already did everything possible to ensure safety ; that retail investors want money-market funds ’ steady value ; that change would hurt all investors ; and that the recent Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation disrupts regulators ’ ability to bail out money-market funds next time .
other regulators were watching , as were academics and journalists – and some regulators may now feel compelled to take over the money-market safety rules from the SEC or push the SEC back into action . with no one having a direct financial interest in the outcome pressing an alternative view , the SEC ’ s initial decision was as predictable as it was bad .
transatlantic Free Trade ?
Madrid – This month , the United States National Intelligence Council released a sobering report entitled Global Trends 2030 : alternative Worlds . most important , according to the authors , if current trends continue , Asia could soon surpass North America and Europe in global power .
this seems to be the approach that inspired outgoing US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s recent speech at the Brookings Institution on US-European relations . given the shift in global power and the prospect of US energy self-sufficiency as domestic hydrocarbon output booms , America is trying to adapt its foreign policy to the new multi-polar international order .
the US , according to Clinton , hopes that Europe will follow suit , so that Asia is seen not only as a market , but also as a focus of common strategic action . but , beyond that , as the US and Europe seek to ensure their global roles , cooperation between them is more important than ever .
Clinton has already hinted at America ’ s readiness for this , mentioning the possibility of negotiating a complete agreement that would increase trade and stimulate growth on both sides of the Atlantic . the journalist David Ignatius even dared to give it a name in a recent article in The Washington Post : TAFTA ( Transatlantic Free-Trade Agreement ) .
the US and the EU ( taken as a whole ) are not only the world ’ s two largest economies and typically the largest commercial partners for other major economies ; they also maintain the world ’ s largest bilateral trade relationship . American investment in Europe is three times higher than it is in Asia .
moreover , the effects of such an agreement would be felt far beyond the US and Europe . for example , both have already signed free-trade treaties with various Latin American countries , implying the creation of a geographically enormous free-trade area , which should boost economic resilience in the face of global crisis .
the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a free-trade agreement spearheaded by the US , is set to be a game-changer in the Asia-Pacific region , with decisive advances this year putting it on course to be concluded in 2015 . potential signatories include the US , Australia , Malaysia , Vietnam , Singapore , New Zealand , Chile , Peru , Brunei , Canada , Mexico , and perhaps Japan and South Korea .
the EU , now confronting a wave of populism and Euro-skepticism , could revive its sense of purpose by committing itself to closer transatlantic cooperation and coordination on trade , to be carried out by the European Commission . such a project has worked before in bringing Europe together ; it can do so again .
protectionism is no solution to the crisis , whereas a transatlantic free-trade agreement would favor multilateralism and openness . in this sense , it is important to stress the work of the World Trade Organization , the best multilateral forum that the world has for resolving trade disputes .
the only way to achieve this is through the clear commitment of political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic , together with private-sector involvement , which is fundamental to sustaining urgently needed economic growth . but let ’ s not wait : faced with predictions of the West ’ s relative decline , the US and the EU must commit themselves to more union , more cooperation , and more prosperity .
financial Reform ’ s Breakthrough Year
ZANZIBAR – Here ’ s an odd prediction for the coming year : 2013 will be a watershed for financial reform . true , while the global financial crisis erupted more than four years ago , and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms were adopted in the United States back in 2010 , not much has changed about how Wall Street operates – except that the large firms have become bigger and more powerful .
in a series of major speeches this fall , Governor Dan Tarullo made the case that the problem of “ too big to fail ” financial institutions remains with us . we need to take additional measures to reduce the level of systemic risk – including limiting the size of our largest banks .
in part , this is because the FDIC is responsible for cleaning up the mess when financial-sector firms fail , so its senior officials have a strong incentive to protect its insurance fund by preventing risks from getting out of control . the FDIC is showing intellectual leadership as well as organizational capabilities – Vice Chairman Tom Hoenig ’ s speeches are a must-read .
but the rolling series of scandals surrounding global megabanks makes it difficult for anyone to keep a straight face when executives insist that our largest banks must maintain their current scale and scope . do we need HSBC to facilitate global money laundering ?
the pro-bank lobby groups are positioning themselves to argue that the new resolution powers under Dodd-Frank have ended the too-big-to-fail problem , and we can expect a public-relations drive in this direction early in the new year . but the consensus view at the most recent meeting of the FDIC ’ s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee ( of which I am a member ) was that this claim should not be taken seriously .
the answer , as former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker implied at the meeting , is that we would be right back where we started – in the panic and frozen credit markets that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 . indeed , the idea that substantial shocks could soon hit the US financial system is not far-fetched .
meanwhile , the continuing problems at European banks are a stark reminder that operating highly leveraged , thinly capitalized firms is incredibly risky . and the regulatory failures in Europe – consider the German Landesbanks , for example – will become only more obvious in the coming months .
the need for banks to finance themselves with more equity and relatively less debt will be the focus of one of the main publishing events in economics in 2013 . Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig ’ s The Bankers ’ New Clothes : what ’ s Wrong with Banking and What to Do About it ? will appear officially in March , but advance copies are already being closely read in leading central banks .
the road to the ongoing financial and economic crisis was built on a foundation of intellectual capture : not only regulators , but academics , too , became captivated by modern finance and its methods . Admati and Hellwig are at the vanguard of the counterrevolution , challenging the great myths of banking head-on .
if banks of all kinds were financed with more equity , they would have stronger buffers to absorb losses . both the equity and the debt issued by well-capitalized banks would be safer – and therefore cheaper .
bankers want to be so highly leveraged for a simple reason : implicit government guarantees mean that they get the upside when things go well , while the downside is someone else ’ s problem . contrary to bankers ’ claims , this is not a good arrangement for society .
Admati and Hellwig are confronting the bankers and their allies in no uncertain terms , grounding their argument in deep financial thinking , yet writing for a broad audience . whatever else happens in 2013 , we can be sure that they will not win the Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year award .
in Defense of Non-Visionaries
Oxford – Many of the recent tributes for Margaret Thatcher following her death celebrated her as a “ transformational ” leader who brought about great changes . there were frequent references to her equally transformational American counterpart , Ronald Reagan .
though often dismissed as a mere “ transactional ” manager , Bush had one of the best foreign-policy records of the past half-century . his administration managed the end of the Cold War , the dismantlement of the Soviet Union , and the unification of Germany within NATO – all without violence .
on the unification of Germany , he resisted the advice of Thatcher and others , apparently out of a sense of fairness and responsiveness to his friend , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . in October 1989 , Bush responded to a call from Kohl by publicly stating that he did not “ share the concern that some European countries have about a reunified Germany . ”
but Bush had made a deliberate choice not to humiliate the Soviets or gloat : “ I won ’ t beat on my chest and dance on the wall , ” was his response – a model of emotional intelligence in a leader . such self-restraint helped to set the stage for the successful Malta Summit with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev a month later .
other critics complained that Bush did not set more transformational objectives regarding Russian democracy , the Middle East , or nuclear non-proliferation at a time when world politics seemed fluid . but , again , Bush remained more focused on maintaining global stability than on advancing new visions .
although a realist in his thinking , he could be Wilsonian in his tactics . Bush ’ s termination of the ground war in Iraq after only four days was motivated in part by humanitarian concerns about the slaughter of Iraqi troops , as well as by an interest in not leaving Iraq so weakened that it could not balance the power of neighboring Iran .
while Bush ’ s invasion of Panama to capture ( and later put on trial ) Manuel Noriega may have violated Panamanian sovereignty , it had a degree of de facto legitimacy , given Noriega ’ s notorious behavior . and , when Bush organized his international coalition to prosecute the Gulf War , he included several Arab countries – not to ensure military success , but to boost the mission ’ s legitimacy .
with his careful combination of hard and soft power , Bush created a successful strategy – one that accomplished American goals in a manner that was not unduly insular and with minimal damage to the interests of foreigners . he was careful not to humiliate Gorbachev , and to manage the transition to Boris Yeltsin ’ s presidency in a newly independent Russia .
for example , Bush assigned a low priority to Kurds and Shia in Iraq , to dissidents in China , and to Bosnians in the former Yugoslavia . in that sense , Bush ’ s realism set limits to his cosmopolitanism .
and , with better communication skills , he might have been able to do more to educate the American public about the changing nature of the post-Cold War world . but , given the profound uncertainty of a world in flux , as well as the dangers of miscalculation as the Soviet empire collapsed , prudent management trumped grand visions .
Thatcher certainly did not . the lesson is that in some circumstances , we should prefer leadership by good transactional managers like George H. W. Bush ( or Dwight Eisenhower before him ) , rather than by more flashy and inspirational transformers .
why Turkey \ u0027s Army Will Stay Home
just when the smoke from Turkey ’ s domestic political conflicts of the past year had begun to clear , another deadly attack by Kurdish separatists on Turkish soldiers has the government threatening military attacks inside northern Iraq . that prospect raises risks for Turkey , Iraq , and the United States .
Turkey accuses Iraqi Kurds of harboring between 3,000 and 3,500 of Turkey ’ s most active Kurdish militants – the PKK separatist guerillas who are blamed for the deaths of 80 Turkish soldiers so far this year . the trouble reached the boiling point on October 7 , when Kurdish fighters killed 13 Turkish soldiers near Turkey ’ s border with Iraq .
the Turkish public has demanded action , and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’ s government has responded . on October 17 , despite pleas for patience and restraint from Iraq and the US , Turkish lawmakers voted 507-19 to authorize Erdogan to order cross-border military strikes into Iraq at any time over the next year .
Erdogan has sent Iraqi Kurds a forceful message . but , for several reasons , the Turkish military is likely to limit its operations to small-scale incursions and air strikes on specific targets rather than launch an all-out war .
first , the Turkish military has no interest in embracing the risks that come with involvement in Iraq ’ s sectarian strife . a full-scale invasion might well provoke Iraq ’ s own Kurdish guerrillas into a prolonged and bloody battle with Turkish forces that can only undermine support for Erdogan ’ s government at home and abroad .
an invasion of Iraq would bring that process to a grinding halt . EU Foreign Policy chief Javier Solana has made plain that Europe strongly opposes any large-scale Turkish military operation in Iraq .
third , Turkey is well aware that an all-out attack inside Iraq is exactly what Turkey ’ s Kurdish separatists want . what better way to damage Turkey than to pull its military into conflict with Iraq , the US , and the EU ?
with all that in mind , this latest move by Turkey ’ s parliament should be seen more as an ultimatum to Iraq ’ s Kurdish Regional Government to expel the Turkish Kurds and an attempt to persuade the US to use its considerable influence there . that ’ s hardball politics , not a declaration of war .
the parliamentary authorization itself is carefully worded to underline Turkey ’ s limited aims . it stresses that Turkey ’ s military has no intention of occupying Iraqi territory or threatening Iraqi Kurds or their oil infrastructure .
Iraq ’ s central government is aware of the risks , as well , and is likely to exercise maximum restraint . a limited Turkish strike into northern Iraq would probably elicit little reaction beyond public condemnation and rhetorical assertions of Iraqi sovereignty .
furthermore , the Turkish military can increase the pressure on Iraqi Kurds with far less drastic measures . it can close the two countries ’ principal border crossing , an important route for food , fuel , and other goods headed for Iraqi Kurds .
still , even small-scale military operations would generate risk . if the PKK is able to launch a major attack on troops or civilians inside Turkey , the public outcry might leave Erdogan with little choice but to up the ante .
the issue is complicated further by Turkey ’ s refusal to negotiate directly with the Kurdish Regional Government in northern Iraq . such talks , Turkey fears , would offer tacit acknowledgement that Iraqi Kurds have won a degree of autonomy from Baghdad .
there are risks for Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki as well , because Turkish military strikes on Iraq ’ s northern provinces could undermine the Kurdish support on which his government increasingly depends . both Sunni Arabs and Kurds already resent al Maliki ’ s mild reaction to Iran ’ s recent shelling of Iraqi territory – an attempt to strike at Iranian Kurdish militants fleeing across its border with Iraq .
most supplies headed for US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan move through the Incirlik airbase in Turkey . with the threat that the US House of Representatives will approve a resolution that accuses Turks of genocide against ethic Armenians nine decades ago , this is a particularly inopportune moment for the two countries to be at odds over Iraq .
but , worst-case scenarios aside , a Turkish invasion of northern Iraq can only serve the interests of Turkey ’ s Kurdish separatists . that ’ s why cooler heads are likely to prevail .
why Ukraine Deserves a Haircut
investors holding high-yielding bonds – many of them bought at heavy discounts after Russia ’ s annexation of Crimea last year – are demanding to be paid in full . Ukraine ’ s government , for its part , argues that the country ’ s financial difficulties – in particular the economic effects of the conflict and the plunge in the value of the hryvnia – have made its debt burden unsustainable .
recent developments have put the country on a path that would have been unimaginable until very recently . for the first time in Ukraine ’ s post-Soviet history , it has a government that is willing and able to carry out real reform .
civil society had been energized by the Maidan revolution that ousted former President Viktor Yanukovych , but it was in turmoil . debate over the association agreement with the European Union , along with the Russian-backed rebellion in the east , had stoked tensions over distinctions that previously played little or no role in people ’ s lives .
Eastern Ukraine may have voted differently from the rest of the country , but the overwhelming majority of voters came out in favor of Europe . the electorate also said no to the more virulent forms of nationalism , leaving the right-wing extremist parties marginalized .
some of its members have displayed worrying populist tendencies , but an analysis of parliamentary voting patterns indicates that so far the coalition has been able to find agreement , even on very difficult issues . the government has , among other things , raised gas tariffs by 450 % ( from absurdly low levels ) .
originally set up to coordinate reforms across ministries and monitor their implementation , it has come to serve as an important tool to discuss and ensure coherence among the different branches of government . this latter role is particularly important , given the constitutional ambiguity created by the reversion back to a parliamentary system and the uneasy co-habitation of President Petro Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk in government .
in between meetings , the council ’ s special project-management office assists in the preparation and implementation of key reforms by ministries . with support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the George Soros-funded International Renaissance Foundation , and bilateral assistance from , among others , the Swedish government , the office has been able to hire staff at market rates , raising the quality of the government administration .
finance Minister Natalie Jaresko and Economic Development and Trade Minister Aivaras Abromavicius were both investment bankers ( neither was a Ukrainian citizen when they joined the government ) . infrastructure Minister Andriy Pivovarsky , also a former investment banker , was most recently CEO of Continium , one of the country ’ s largest holding companies .
one of the country ’ s most interesting new ventures is VoxUkraine , a blogging platform set up by two Ukrainian economics professors based in the United States , Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Timofiy Mylovanov . they have championed modern evidence-based decision-making and constantly come up with new , constructive ways of challenging the government and its assumptions .
the government is fighting at least two wars simultaneously – taking on a deeply entrenched oligarchy , while trying to fend off its hostile eastern neighbor . further trouble – in the form a steeply declining economy – is something it cannot afford .
for the first time since the country gained its independence in 1992 , Ukraine has a clear sense of direction and a government capable of supporting reform . there are signs that the oligarchs ’ grip is beginning to loosen , owing partly to internal conflicts among them .
when Inflation Doves Cry
the report was correct but misleading , for it failed to mention why there is so little inflation in the US today . were the doves right , or just lucky ?
the US Federal Reserve Board has pumped out trillions of dollars of reserves , but never have so many reserves produced so little monetary growth . neither the hawks nor the doves ( nor anyone else ) expected that .
monetarists insist that economies experience inflation when money-supply growth persistently exceeds output growth . that has not happened yet , so inflation has been postponed .
instead of rejecting monetary theory and history , the army of Wall Street soothsayers should look beyond the Fed ’ s press releases and ask themselves : does it make sense to throw out centuries of experience ? are we really so confident that the Fed has found a new way ?
for the 12 months ending in July , the St. Louis Fed reports that bank reserves rose 31 % . during the same period , a commonly used measure of monetary growth , M2 , increased by only 6.8 % .
indeed , almost all the reserves added in the second and third rounds of QE , more than 95 % , are sitting in excess reserves , neither lent nor borrowed and never used to increase money in circulation . the Fed pays the banks 0.25 % to keep them idle .
with $ 2 trillion in excess reserves , and the prospect of as much as $ 85 billion added each month , banks receive $ 5 billion a year , and rising , without taking any risk . for the bankers , that ’ s a bonanza , paid from monies that the Fed would normally pay to the US Treasury .
currently , however , it is downright counter-productive . Bank loans have started to increase , but small borrowers , new borrowers , and start-up companies are regularly refused .
current low interest rates do not cover the risk that banks would take . to be sure , they could raise the rate for new and small borrowers ; but , in the current political climate , they would stand accused of stifling economic recovery if they did .
the new Consumer Financial Protection Board is also a deterrent , as banks consider it safer to lend to the government , large corporations , and giant real-estate speculators . the banks can report record profits without much risk , rebuild capital , and pay dividends and bonuses .
it should stop paying interest on excess reserves until the US economy returns to a more normal footing . most important , it should announce a strategy for eliminating the massive volume of such reserves .
it must do more than repeat that the Fed can raise interest rates paid on reserves to encourage banks to hold them . it will take a clearly stated , widely understood strategy – the kind that Paul Volcker introduced in 1979-1982 – to complete the job .
waiting until inflation is here , as some propose , is the usual way . but that merely fuels inflation expectations and makes the task more painful .
and how high will the Fed push up interest rates ? once rates get to 5 % or 6 % , assuming inflation remains dormant , the Fed can expect a backlash from Congress , the administration , unions , homebuilders , and others .
and that is just the first two years . the budget cost increases every year , as more of the debt rolls over – &amp; # 160 ; and that does not include agency debt and the large increase in the current-account deficit to pay China , Japan , and other foreign holders of US debt .
those who believe that inflation will remain low should look more thoroughly and think more clearly . there are plenty of good textbooks that explain what too many policymakers and financial-market participants would rather forget .
send in the Clowns
new YORK – When too many Italians voted late last month for either a louche and discredited business tycoon or a comedian , European stock markets plummeted . with no public trust in the political class , Italy might become ungovernable .
rage against the political establishment has become a global phenomenon . Chinese bloggers , American Tea Party activists , British Europhobes , Egyptian Islamists , Dutch populists , Greek ultra-rightists , and Thai “ red shirts ” all have one thing in common : hatred of the status quo and contempt for their countries ’ elites .
populism can be a necessary corrective when political parties grow sclerotic , mass media become too complacent ( or too close to power ) , and bureaucracies are unresponsive to popular needs . in a globalized world managed by bankers and technocrats , many people feel that they have no say in public affairs ; they feel abandoned .
our national politicians , increasingly powerless to cope with serious crises , are suspected , often with good reason , of simply looking after their own interests . all we can do is vote the rascals out , sometimes by voting for candidates whom we would not take seriously in more normal times .
some preach that Muslims are destroying Western civilization . others think that President Barack Obama is a kind of communist out to destroy America .
two types of contemporary populist , however , stand out : the ultra-rich business tycoon and the clown . in the Anglo-Saxon media world , Rupert Murdoch , owner of far too many newspapers , TV stations , and movie studios , is a typical populist tycoon .
neither the clown nor the tycoon is well suited to being a democratic leader . the question is which is worse .
medieval court jesters were often the only ones who could speak truth to despotic kings . today , it is often comedians who claim to speak truth to power – and to the public .
in America , liberals turn for political commentary to television comedians like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert , who are now more trusted than traditional news broadcasters . and clownish right-wing radio talk-show hosts now have more influence on many conservative American voters than the sober journalists of the mainstream media do .
a few years ago , a clown named Brozo , with a large red nose and a bright green wig , was Mexico ’ s most popular political commentator on television , actively courted by all candidates running for national office . in 1980 , the French clown Coluche actually dropped out of the presidential race when one newspaper put his popular support at 16 % , causing him to fear that he might influence the result too much .
Fortuyn ’ s outrageousness was deliberately provocative and always entertaining . his rants against the elites were often confused , but he was funny , which made the old elite politicians look like stuffy old bores – which many of them were .
and now Italy has Beppe Grillo , whose success in the country ’ s recent election makes him the first professional comedian to lead a major political party in Europe .
the thing about clowns , though , is that few have any aspirations to rule their countries . before his death , Fortuyn is said to have been terrified of the prospect of becoming Prime Minister .
they are less likely than members of the professional political class to allow political calculations to influence their views . and , sometimes , they actually say things that are uncomfortable but true , and that need to be said .
they attack the old elites not to shake things up , but to take their power . promising to spread the riches that they have made for themselves , they exploit the fantasies of those of us who have little and want more .
in Thailand , the self-made ethnic-Chinese media billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra was especially admired by the rural poor . like a beneficent king , he would give them money , and promised to challenge the old elites in Bangkok – the bankers , generals , judges , and even the courtiers surrounding the Thai king .
and they do not hesitate to undermine an independent press or judiciary when their business interests are threatened . even though his sister , Yingluck Shinawatra , is now in power , Thaksin is still trying to evade trial in Thai courts on a wide array of financial charges .
as it happens , Thaksin was overthrown in 2006 by a military coup that was largely backed by the Bangkok elites . Berlusconi was replaced by a government run by elite technocrats , whose policies had to be approved by European bankers and European Union bureaucrats .
neither of these responses to populism is likely to boost democracy . on the contrary , they make things worse .
the Battle for Water
new YORK – The sharpening international geopolitical competition over natural resources has turned some strategic resources into engines of power struggle . transnational water resources have become an especially active source of competition and conflict , triggering a dam-building race and prompting growing calls for the United Nations to recognize water as a key security concern .
similarly , countries can import fossil fuels , mineral ores , and resources from the biosphere like fish and timber ; but they cannot import water , which is essentially local , on a large scale and on a prolonged – much less permanent – basis . water is heavier than oil , making it very expensive to ship or transport across long distances even by pipeline ( which would require large , energy-intensive pumps ) .
the paradox of water is that it sustains life but can also cause death when it becomes a carrier of deadly microbes or takes the form of a tsunami , flash flood , storm , or hurricane . many of the greatest natural disasters of our time – including , for example , the Fukushima catastrophe in 2011 – have been water-related .
global warming is set to put potable-water supplies under increasing strain – even as oceans rise and the intensity and frequency of storms and other extreme weather events increase . rapid economic and demographic expansion has already turned adequate access to potable water into a major issue across large parts of the world .
today , the earth ’ s human population totals slightly more than seven billion , but the livestock population at any given time numbers more than 150 billion . the direct ecological footprint of the livestock population is larger than that of the human population , with rapidly rising global meat consumption becoming a key driver of water stress by itself .
political and economic water wars are already being waged in several regions , reflected in dam construction on international rivers and coercive diplomacy or other means to prevent such works . consider , for example , the silent water war triggered by Ethiopia ’ s dam building on the Blue Nile , which has elicited Egyptian threats of covert or overt military reprisals .
a report reflecting the joint judgment of US intelligence agencies warned last year that the use of water as a weapon of war or a tool of terrorism would become more likely in the next decade in some regions . the InterAction Council , comprising more than 30 former heads of state or government , has called for urgent action to prevent some countries battling severe water shortages from becoming failed states .
in many countries , inadequate local water availability is increasingly constraining decisions about where to set up new manufacturing facilities and energy plants . the World Bank estimates that such constraints are costing China 2.3 % of GDP .
nature ’ s water-replenishment capacity is fixed , limiting the world ’ s usable freshwater resources to about 200,000 cubic kilometers . but the human population has almost doubled since 1970 , while the global economy has grown even faster .
heavier citizens make heavier demands on natural resources , especially water and energy . the issue thus is not just about how many mouths there are to feed , but also how much excess body fat there is on the planet .
with the era of cheap , bountiful water having been replaced by increasing supply and quality constraints , many investors are beginning to view water as the new oil . the dramatic rise of the bottled-water industry since the 1990 ’ s attests to the increasing commodification of the world ’ s most critical resource .
this double whammy can be mitigated only by innovative water management and conservation , and by developing nontraditional supply sources . as in the oil and gas sector – where tapping unconventional sources , such as shale and tar sands , has proved a game changer – the water sector must adopt all unconventional options , including recycling wastewater and desalinating ocean and brackish waters .
in short , we must focus on addressing our water-supply problems as if our lives depended on it . in fact , they do .
the Biology of Luxury
why ? while marketing has contributed to the rise , the luxury market ’ s robust growth is actually rooted in biology .
discussions about the structure of human thought have long been dominated by the Enlightenment view that reality is composed of four elements : space , time , matter , and energy . but recently , a fifth element , information , has entered the debate .
living organisms communicate , and the information that they exchange shapes their reality . while animals use colorful displays and complicated behaviors to signal fitness and strength , humans use luxury goods to demonstrate economic health .
but , more than a symbol , buying luxury goods could indicate future success , owing to the selective advantage that showing off provides . in nature , competitors perform , and the most compelling , beautiful spectacle wins .
for most animals , males are the performers . male birds , for example , often have brightly colored plumage or intricate appendages , such as the Australian lyrebird ’ s long tail .
as a result , competitive displays have been interpreted as a way to demonstrate fitness to a potential mate . a bird that survives , despite inconvenient plumage that slows it down or makes it visible to predators , must be fit , and will likely sire a healthy progeny .
but humans are social creatures with no natural predators , so female competition is more widespread – and demonstrative performance and display are more likely . indeed , while visual manifestations of wealth are prevalent for both genders , women ’ s appearance is frequently more vivid ( and more closely scrutinized ) .
genes are difficult to maintain , requiring subtle and energy-intensive correcting processes . just as writing too fast can cause typographical errors that garble a text , rapid changes to the genome can undermine a species ’ integrity .
this cost dictates the display ’ s competitive impact . in today ’ s information-based world , selection is effective only if a striking appearance is obtained at a very high price – and that price is known .
for example , those who use cosmetics known to be expensive often seem healthier , more vibrant , and more attractive than those who do not . this is not the result of efficiency ( the most effective cosmetics frequently become pharmaceutical drugs ) .
indeed , an expensive item with no label or identifying characteristics has less competitive impact than a recognized item or brand . for luxury goods to have any function , society needs information about their cost .
animals commonly use mimicry to capitalize on knowledge – or fear – of another ’ s strength . by imitating an animal with a well-known protective profile , a weaker one may enjoy selective benefits without the costs .
but mimicry ’ s success in nature depends on the ratio of the original to the ersatz . if there are too few of the original , the profile loses its significance , and its protective value vanishes .
similarly , nobody would display a symbol of wealth if it were too common . therefore , assessing whether luxury goods will maintain their impact , and thus their appeal , requires monitoring the extent of counterfeiting .
given that luxury goods provide individuals with a competitive advantage , higher luxury-goods sales could indicate a brighter economic future for a country .
why Wolfensohn Mattered
at the end of this month , James Wolfensohn ’ s ten-year tenure as President of the World Bank comes to an end . though much remains to be accomplished and consolidated , his achievements as leader of the international development community are noteworthy and provide a strong foundation upon which to build .
perhaps Wolfensohn ’ s most important contribution was to clarify the Bank ’ s mission – to promote growth and eradicate poverty in the developing world – while recognizing the massive scale of that task and the inadequacy of previous approaches .
at one time , it was thought that since developing countries had less capital than more developed countries , merely supplying more capital would solve their problems . indeed , this view provided part of the rationale for the World Bank : if a shortage of funds was the problem , clearly a Bank would have to be a key part of the solution .
in the 1980 ’ s , there was a switch from projects to policies – structural adjustments , involving trade liberalization , privatization , and macroeconomic stabilization ( typically focusing on prices rather than employment or output . ) But these policies proved neither necessary nor sufficient for growth ; the countries of East Asia , which followed different policies , achieved faster growth and were far more successful in poverty reduction .
in a malaria-infested country , mosquito eradication programs can boost production and even increase effective land usage , as acres that were almost uninhabitable become livable . the returns from education , too , can be increased , if more individuals live longer because of better health care .
among the success stories were India and East Asia , which invested heavily not just in primary education , but also in secondary and tertiary education , and especially in technology and science . this represented a major change in the Bank ’ s approach to education , which previously focused on primary schooling .
failed states , it was now acknowledged , were no less an impediment to development than were overbearing states . the Bank ’ s 1997 World Development Report reflected this new attempt at finding a balanced role for the state , and showed an understanding of the limitations both of markets and government .
when then US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers tried to change the Bank ’ s Decennial report on poverty – to downgrade concerns about insecurity and empowerment and to focus more narrowly on income – the Bank prevailed . when the US tried to suppress the Bank ’ s call for a more balanced intellectual property regime – one more consonant with the interests of developing countries – the Bank prevailed yet again .
both the Bush administration and the EU would undoubtedly have preferred less criticism of their trade regimes , which have such adverse effects on developing countries . it would have been helpful for Bush if the World Bank quietly accepted proposals to finance debt relief for the poorest countries by depleting its reserves , thereby making poor countries pay for the poorest by reducing the Bank ’ s lending capacity .
in the past , the Bank was seen as a purveyor of neoliberal orthodoxy – an approach to development whose credibility had weakened by the time Wolfensohn arrived , and whose standing has eroded further since . that orthodoxy often went hand in hand with the national , corporate , and financial interests of the advanced industrial countries , or so it was perceived .
worse , the Bank typically demanded myriad conditions in return for assistance , an approach that undermined democratic processes and domestic ownership of policies , thereby enervating their effectiveness . when Bank research showed that conditionality did not work , the Bank under Wolfensohn moved away from it .
the Bank ’ s attempt to open the debate was not well received , by either the US Treasury or the IMF , but its influence was undeniable . the Fund , too , began to reduce conditionality , and eventually it began to question the desirability of capital market liberalization , which previously had been central to its agenda .
gradually the Bank came to be perceived , at least in many quarters , as a partner in the joint quest for growth and poverty reduction , not an adversary attempting to promote a Western economic agenda or ideology . Wolfensohn meant it when he said that he wanted to put the country in the driver ’ s seat , though not everyone within the Bank was as enthusiastic about this ( or some of his other ) initiatives .
James Wolfensohn presided over the World Bank at a time of enormous change , tumult , and opportunity , an era marked by the end of the Cold War , the postcommunist transition to market economies , and the East Asian – and then global – financial crises . his commitment to those in the developing world has been contagious .
will Banks and Financial Markets Recover in 2009 ?
major financial institutions went bust ; others were bought up on the cheap or survived only after major bailouts . global stock markets fell by more than 50 % ; interest-rate spreads skyrocketed ; a severe liquidity and credit crunch appeared ; and many emerging-market economies staggered to the International Monetary Fund for help .
is the worst behind us or ahead of us ? to answer these questions , we must understand that a vicious circle of economic contraction and worsening financial conditions is underway .
there will be recession in the euro zone , the United Kingdom , Continental Europe , Canada , Japan , and the other advanced economies . there is also a risk of a hard landing for emerging-market economies , as trade , financial , and currency links transmit real and financial shocks to them .
in the advanced economies , recession had brought back earlier in 2008 fears of 1970 ’ s-style stagflation ( a combination of economic stagnation and inflation ) . but , with aggregate demand falling below growing aggregate supply , slack goods markets will lead to lower inflation as firms ’ pricing power is restrained .
deflation is dangerous as it leads to a liquidity trap : nominal policy rates cannot fall below zero , so monetary policy becomes ineffective . falling prices mean that the real cost of capital is high and the real value of nominal debts rise , leading to further declines in consumption and investment – and thus setting in motion a vicious circle in which incomes and jobs are squeezed further , aggravating the fall in demand and prices .
as traditional monetary policy becomes ineffective , other unorthodox policies will continue to be used : policies to bail out investors , financial institutions , and borrowers ; massive provision of liquidity to banks in order to ease the credit crunch ; and even more radical actions to reduce long-term interest rates on government bonds and narrow the spread between market rates and government bonds .
today ’ s global crisis was triggered by the collapse of the US housing bubble , but it was not caused by it . America ’ s credit excesses were in residential mortgages , commercial mortgages , credit cards , auto loans , and student loans .
there was also a commodity bubble and a private equity and hedge funds bubble . indeed , we now see the demise of the shadow banking system , the complex of non-bank financial institutions that looked like banks as they borrowed short term and in liquid ways , leveraged a lot , and invested in longer term and illiquid ways .
as a result , the biggest asset and credit bubble in human history is now going bust , with overall credit losses likely to be close to a staggering $ 2 trillion . thus , unless governments rapidly recapitalize financial institutions , the credit crunch will become even more severe as losses mount faster than recapitalization and banks are forced to contract credit and lending .
equity prices and other risky assets have fallen sharply from their peaks of late 2007 , but there are still significant downside risks . an emerging consensus suggests that the prices of many risky assets – including equities – have fallen so much that we are at the bottom and a rapid recovery will occur .
but the worst is still ahead of us . in the next few months , the macroeconomic news and earnings / profits reports from around the world will be much worse than expected , putting further downward pressure on prices of risky assets , because equity analysts are still deluding themselves that the economic contraction will be mild and short .
while the risk of a total systemic financial meltdown has been reduced by the actions of the G-7 and other economies to backstop their financial systems , severe vulnerabilities remain . the credit crunch will get worse ; deleveraging will continue , as hedge funds and other leveraged players are forced to sell assets into illiquid and distressed markets , thus causing more price falls and driving more insolvent financial institutions out of business .
so 2009 will be a painful year of global recession and further financial stresses , losses , and bankruptcies . only aggressive , coordinated , and effective policy actions by advanced and emerging-market countries can ensure that the global economy recovers in 2010 , rather than entering a more protracted period of economic stagnation .
Europe ’ s Unending Berlusconi Problem
London – Silvio Berlusconi , Italy ’ s three-time prime minister and the country ’ s dominant politician for two decades , has now been convicted and sentenced to four years in prison – a sentence since reduced to one year . &amp; # 160 ; But few people in Italy – or in Europe – believe that Berlusconi will fade from Italian , or European , politics anytime soon .
he may not wish to be king again , but he certainly can be a kingmaker , owing to his control of Mediaset , Italy ’ s largest media group . and , given his abysmal popularity ratings , he may decide to play the wild card , embrace a euro-skeptic and anti-government stance , and try to bring down Prime Minister Mario Monti ’ s technocratic administration .
the interest-rate spread has stabilized around a more manageable 300 basis points , but is still higher than it was three years ago . in addition , Italy ’ s economic outlook remains highly uncertain .
indeed , the modest economic recovery that should benefit many countries in 2013 seems to be eluding Italy . according to the IMF , the economy will remain in recession next year , and , though the rate of contraction will be less severe than in 2012 ( -0.7 % in 2013 , compared to -2.3 % this year ) , the unemployment rate is expected to rise further , from 10.6 % to 11.1 % .
while the odds still favor a relatively smooth transition , many uncertainties could derail the reform process . in particular , whether Italy will be able to move beyond technocratic politics to a “ normal ” government remains the outstanding question both at home and for the other eurozone member states .
with potential instability looming , Monti should ensure that Italy is not defenseless in the event of another round of market instability . unlike some months ago , now the European Central Bank can intervene and buy troubled countries ’ debt .
will Cap-and-Trade Incite Protectionism ?
Cambridge ­ – There is a serious danger that the international adoption of cap-and-trade legislation to limit carbon-dioxide emissions will trigger a new round of protectionist measures . while aimed at reducing long-term environmental damage , cap-and-trade policies could produce significant harmful economic effects in the near term that would continue into the future .
a common suggestion is to impose a tax on all CO2 emissions , which would be levied on companies that emit CO2 in production , or that sell products like gasoline that cause CO2 emissions when used . such a tax would cause electricity companies and industrial firms to adopt techniques that reduce their CO2 emissions , as long as the cost of doing so is less than the tax that they would otherwise have to pay .
the higher cost of production incurred to reduce emissions – and of any emissions tax still due – would , of course , be included in the price charged to consumers . consumers would respond to the tax-induced increase in the cost of the emissions-intensive products by reducing their consumption of those goods and services in favor of goods and services that create smaller amounts of CO2 emissions .
a carbon tax causes each firm and household to respond to the same cost of adding CO2 to the atmosphere . that uniform individual cost incentive allows total CO2 to be reduced at a lower total cost than would be achieved by a variety of administrative requirements , such as automobile mileage standards , production technology standards ( e.g. , minimum renewable fuel inputs in electricity generation ) , etc .
although governments levy taxes on gasoline , they are reluctant to impose a general carbon tax because of public opposition to any form of taxation . governments have therefore focused on a cap-and-trade system as a way of increasing the cost of CO2-intensive products without explicitly imposing a tax .
in a cap-and-trade system , the government sets total allowable national emissions of CO2 per year and requires any firm that causes CO2 emissions to have a permit per ton of CO2 emitted . if the government sells these permits in an auction , the price of the permit would be a cost to the firm in the same way as a carbon tax – and with the same resulting increases in consumer prices .
even if every country has a cap-and-trade system and all aim at the same relative reduction in national CO2 emissions , the resulting permit prices will differ because of national differences in initial CO2 levels and in domestic production characteristics . because the price of the CO2 permits in a country is reflected in the prices of its products , the cap-and-trade system affects its international competitiveness .
when the permit prices become large enough to have a significant effect on CO2 emissions , there will be political pressure to introduce tariffs on imports that offset the advantage of countries with low permit prices . such offsetting tariffs would have to differ among products ( being higher on more CO2-intensive products ) and among countries ( being higher for countries with low permit prices ) .
better roads , ports , and even schools all contribute to a country ’ s competitiveness . no one attempts to use tariffs to balance those government-created differences in competitiveness , and there should be no such attempts if a cap-and-trade system is introduced .
if an international agreement to impose a cap-and-trade scheme is adopted in Copenhagen , the countries there should agree as well that there will be no attempt to introduce offsetting tariffs that would ultimately threaten our global system of free trade .
will China “ Lose ” the 2008 Olympics ?
when the International Olympic Committee awarded Beijing the 2008 Summer Games in July 2001 , the announcement ignited wild celebrations across the country . the Chinese Communist Party hoped to use the Games to showcase the country ’ s emergence as a dynamic , modern nation .
China ’ s senior leaders always closely monitor spontaneous public expressions of nationalist fervor , fearful that shifting winds might blow an unwelcome storm in their direction . of course what they hope is that the Games will channel these energies toward national solidarity , which will allow the leadership to deliver its people a moment of achievement and patriotic glory .
but the Olympics will also bring intense international scrutiny of China ’ s weaknesses at a delicate moment in the country ’ s development . the world already knows of China ’ s success and its attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment , but few outsiders have seen firsthand the steep price the country is paying for its new prosperity .
runaway growth and development have left about 70 % of China ’ s lakes and rivers severely polluted , many unfit for human use of any kind . indeed , nearly a half-billion Chinese lack access to clean drinking water , and the number of terminally polluted rivers and lakes grows daily .
but air quality will prove the more embarrassing problem next August . television coverage of athletes gasping for breath will hardly provide Beijing with the signature Olympic image it had in mind , and growing international anxiety over climate change and other environmental hazards will ensure that such issues receive considerable media coverage .
there is also the risk that the Games will become a political circus , as the international spotlight generates irresistible opportunities for public protest . the Chinese leadership has demonstrated many times that it can quell domestic dissent , but the unique scale of the Olympics will require round-the-clock vigilance .
activists with grievances over Tibet , Taiwan , Burma , Darfur , and dozens of other political , environmental , and human-rights issues are already making plans . is China ready for Greenpeace , Human Rights in China , Amnesty International , and Falun Gong supporters to take to the streets , with thousands of foreign journalists hungry for stories and asking questions that the authorities are unaccustomed to answering ?
can they manage the flow of information and ideas through the blogosphere as online activists open yet another front in their battle for free information ? what we do know that Chinese officials have never faced a challenge of this scale with such a potential to both win and lose face .
he has already proposed a popular referendum on Taiwanese membership in the United Nations . China ’ s influence within the UN would prevent such a move even if Taiwan voted yes , but an international confrontation is the last thing China wants coinciding with the Olympics .
since 2001 , China has increasingly become the focal point of much anxiety in the developed world . huge bilateral trade deficits , accusations that China keeps its currency undervalued , and a rash of defective and dangerous Chinese-made exports have fueled a protectionist backlash in the United States and Europe .
will China ’ s uneasy Asian neighbors be any more receptive ? international criticism is sure to follow if something , anything , goes wrong during the Games , especially if it involves the suppression of dissent and is vectored around the world via 24-hour cable television and the Internet .
as China ’ s leaders scramble to address these challenges , will they still relish the idea of providing an international audience with front-row seats ? how they look back on the Games once the confetti is swept from the streets is far from certain .
will China ’ s Capitalist Revolution Turn Democratic
Communist China has experienced a monumental capitalist revolution in the last two decades , with an economy that is now six times bigger than it was 20 years ago . a minor player in the global economy in the 1980 ’ s , China today is the world ’ s third largest trading power .
thus , for all its awe-inspiring economic achievement , China has made remarkably little progress in political liberalization . indeed , judging by several key indicators , progress toward democracy in China has stalled , despite unprecedented economic prosperity and personal freedom .
nearly all the major institutional reforms , such as strengthening the legislature , holding village elections , and building a modern legal system , were launched in the 1980 ’ s . since the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989 , however , not a single major democratic reform initiative has been implemented .
instead of democratic transition , China has witnessed a consolidation of authoritarian rule – the strengthening of a one-party regime through organizational learning and adaptation . since 1989 , the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) has been pursuing a two-pronged strategy : selective repression that targets organized political opposition and co-optation of new social elites ( the intelligentsia , professionals , and private entrepreneurs ) .
having learned from the collapse of the Soviet Union that a bureaucratic ruling party must co-opt new social elites to deprive potential opposition groups of leaders , the Communist Party has conducted an effective campaign of expanding its social base . the urban intelligentsia and professionals have been pampered with material perks and political recognition , while new private entrepreneurs have been allowed to join the Party .
this strategy of pre-emptive political decapitation has produced enormous dividends for the Party . in the 1980 ’ s , its principal adversaries were the urban intelligentsia , who constituted the backbone of the pro-democracy movement that culminated in Tiananmen Square .
predictably , the intelligentsia , usually the most liberal social group , is no longer a lethal threat to party rule . worse , without support from this strategic group , other social groups , such as workers and peasants , have become politically marginalized and rudderless .
at the same time , selective repression can contain social frustrations and discontent only temporarily . as long as much of Chinese society views the current political system as unjust , unresponsive , and corrupt , there will always be a large reservoir of ill will toward the ruling elites .
when things go wrong – as is likely , given mounting social strains caused by rising inequality , environmental degradation , and deteriorating public services – China ’ s alienated masses could become politically radicalized . and , unlike past protests , which have usually been allied with students or members of the intelligentsia , popular disaffection might not have the virtue of rational leaders with whom the government could talk and negotiate .
so it may be premature for the Party to celebrate the success of its adaptive strategy . China ’ s rulers may have stalled democratic trends for now , but the current strategy has , perhaps , merely delayed the inevitable .
the Mirage of the Financial Singularity
new HAVEN – In their new book The Incredible Shrinking Alpha , Larry E. Swedroe and Andrew L. Berkin describe an investment environment populated by increasingly sophisticated analysts who rely on big data , powerful computers , and scholarly research . with all this competition , “ the hurdles to achieving alpha &#91; returns above a risk-adjusted benchmark – and thus a measure of success in picking individual investments &#93; are getting higher and higher . ”
that conclusion raises a key question : will alpha eventually go to zero for every imaginable investment strategy ? more fundamentally , is the day approaching when , thanks to so many smart people and smarter computers , financial markets really do become perfect , and we can just sit back , relax , and assume that all assets are priced correctly ?
this imagined state of affairs might be called the financial singularity , analogous to the hypothetical future technological singularity , when computers replace human intelligence . the financial singularity implies that all investment decisions would be better left to a computer program , because the experts with their algorithms have figured out what drives market outcomes and reduced it to a seamless system .
in a recent paper , “ Buffett ’ s Alpha , ” Andrea Frazzini and David Kabiller of AQR Capital Management and Lasse Pedersen of Copenhagen Business School , conclude that Buffett is not generating significantly positive alpha if one takes account of certain lesser-known risk factors that have weighed heavily in his portfolio . the implication is that Buffet ’ s genius could be replicated by a computer program that incorporates these factors .
if that were true , investors would abandon , en masse , their efforts to ferret out mispricing in the market , because there wouldn ’ t be any . market participants would rationally assume that every stock price is the true expected present value of future cash flows , with the appropriate rate of discount , and that those cash flows reflect fundamentals that everyone understands the same way .
the Grossman-Stiglitz conundrum seems less compelling in the financial singularity if we can imagine that computers direct all the investment decisions . although alpha may be vanishingly small , it still represents enough profit to keep the computers running .
but the real problem with this vision of financial singularity is not the Grossman-Stiglitz conundrum ; it is that real-world markets are nowhere close to it . computer enthusiasts are excited by things like the blockchain used by Bitcoin ( covered on an education website called Singularity University , in a section dramatically titled Exponential Finance ) .
news accounts depict hordes of emotional people trading on hunch and superstition . that looks a lot more like reality than all the talk of impending financial singularity .
markets seem to be driven by stories , as I emphasize in my book Irrational Exuberance . there are stories of great new eras and of looming depressions .
when one has a heart-to-heart talk with many seemingly rational people , they turn out to have crazy theories . these people influence markets , because all other investors must reckon with them ; and their craziness is not going away anytime soon .
but that does not necessarily detract from his genius . indeed , the true source of his success may consist in his understanding of when to abandon one method and devise another .
the idea of financial singularity may seem inspiring ; but it is no less illusory than the rational Utopia that inspired generations of central planners . human judgment , good and bad , will drive investment decisions and financial-market outcomes for the rest of our lives and beyond .
will Europe Be Willing but Disabled ?
NEWPORT BEACH – When it comes to describing Europe ’ s ever-worsening crisis , metaphors abound . for some , it is five minutes to midnight ; for others , Europe is a car accelerating towards the edge of a cliff .
optimists – fortunately , there remain a few , especially in Europe itself – believe that when the situation becomes really critical , political leaders will turn things around and put Europe back on the path of economic growth , job creation , and financial stability . but pessimists have been growing in number and influence .
of course , who is ultimately proven correct is a function of eurozone governments ’ willingness to make the difficult decisions that are required , and in a coordinated and timely fashion . but that is not the only determinant : governments must also be able to turn things around once the willingness to do so materializes .
left to its own devices , such a grouping is vulnerable to recurrent bickering , disruptive posturing , and disagreement over visions of the future . as a result , progress towards meaningful economic and political integration can be painfully slow during the good times .
that is where the eurozone is today . a debt crisis that erupted in Greece , the eurozone ’ s outer periphery , has migrated with a vengeance towards the core , so much so that the survival of the eurozone itself is at stake .
talk of countries exiting , starting with Greece ( the “ Grexit ” ) , is now rampant . and only hard-core idealists dismiss altogether the mounting risk of the eurozone ’ s total disintegration .
nonetheless , many veterans of the European integration project see a silver lining in the dark clouds massing over their creation . for them , only a crisis can stop politicians from just kicking various cans farther down the road and , instead , catalyze the policy initiatives – greater fiscal , banking , and political union – that , together with monetary union , would ensure that the eurozone rests on a stable and sustainable four-legged platform .
it assumes that , when push comes to shove , political leaders will indeed do what is necessary – the willingness question . it also presumes that they will have the capacity to do so – the ability question .
today ’ s eurozone is beset by an unprecedented degree of rejection – on economic , financial , political , and social grounds – &amp; nbsp ; by citizens in a growing number of countries . the longer this persists , the harder it will be for politicians to maintain control of their countries ’ destinies and that of Europe ’ s collective enterprise .
private-sector activity is slowing , and it is nearing a standstill in the eurozone ’ s most vulnerable economy ( Greece ) , where a bank run is in full swing . elsewhere , too , depositors are beginning to transfer their savings to the strongest economy ( Germany ) and to safe havens beyond ( Switzerland and the United States ) .
no wonder that fringe political movements are gaining traction throughout the eurozone . and no wonder that voters in almost two-thirds of eurozone countries have turned out the incumbents in their most recent elections .
all of this serves to undermine the effectiveness of government policies – by reducing their credibility , clogging their channels of transmission to the economy , and making it difficult to offset the withdrawal of private-sector capital and spending . as a result , the market-based economic and financial systems that prevail in Europe , and that , not so long ago , were a source of significant strength , are losing their vibrancy .
I , too , am fond of metaphors . during a trip to the continent last week , I heard one that captures very well the key dynamic in Europe today .
so the outcome no longer depends only on their willingness to cooperate in order to navigate the raft to safety . it also hinges on their ability to do so in the midst of natural forces that are increasingly difficult to control and overcome .
the current crisis might indeed eventually break eurozone leaders ’ inherent resistance to compromise , collaboration , and common action . but the longer they bicker and dither , the greater the risk that what they gain in willingness will be lost to incapacity .
will Europe Learn to Love Bush ?
EU “ Foreign Minister ” Javier Solana has already been there , and returned bullish on future transatlantic cooperation . Atmospherically , at least , relations have , indeed , improved since the US presidential election , and both sides have expressed good will .
Bush ’ s declared intention to “ better explain the reasons for his decisions ” to America ’ s Allies simply will not do . Europeans don ’ t want explanations ; they want to be consulted – to have input into American decision-making and see their concerns reflected in US foreign policy .
on the contrary , the US is continuing to thwart European efforts gradually to establish a rule-based international order . there are no signs that the Bush administration is relenting on , for example , the UN , the Kyoto Protocol , the International Criminal Court , the ban on land mines , or the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty .
in Iraq , Europeans fully share the American objectives of preserving the country ’ s unity and achieving at least some modicum of democracy . at the same time , they believe that it is up to the US to remove the chaos it created , so they are reluctant to contribute to the task in a substantive way .
there is general agreement on the aims to be achieved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict : the end of violence and a peaceful solution based on the concept of two sovereign states . however , Europeans consider the opinion recently expressed by Bush – that Palestinian democracy and not Israeli occupation of the West Bank is at the core of the problem – to be ill conceived .
on the question of Iran ’ s nuclear weapons capability , Americans and Europeans also fundamentally agree : it should be prevented . while the US tries to achieve this through hard power , regime change , sanctions , and threats of pre-emptive military intervention , Europe uses soft power , diplomacy , inclusion , and partnership .
European efforts to induce Teheran to renounce its nuclear designs by addressing Iran ’ s legitimate security concerns and offering important opportunities for economic and social betterment cannot be successful without active US support . in other words , Europe ’ s carrots are not enough ; a successful outcome requires American carrots , too .
by standing aside and discounting the European approach from the outset , America is merely helping to bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy . it would be more productive for the US to join in , at the same time agreeing with Europeans on measures to be taken should their combined efforts fail .
China has become Europe ’ s biggest trading partner , and its huge reserves of US dollars has made it America ’ s most important creditor . despite this rosy picture , China could be the cause of a major transatlantic row if Europeans make good on their intention to lift the arms export embargo in place since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 .
the Bush administration is fiercely opposed to lifting the embargo , pointing out that in the event of a military clash over Taiwan , US troops would face weapons provided to China by America ’ s own allies . in fact , European assurances that arms sales to China could be controlled and threats to an ally avoided do appear unconvincing .
in short , on many of the most important current international issues , Americans and Europeans share the same objectives and basic goals . where they often diverge is in the means to achieve them .
Bush must be willing to accept Europeans as genuine partners and stop treating them like recalcitrant vassals . European leaders must overcome any latent Anti-Americanism and be prepared to make the kind of contributions to common endeavors that would entitle them to equal partnership with the US .
will Europe ’ s Fiscal Compact Work ?
a limit on the “ structural deficit ” means that a country can run a deficit above the limit to the extent – and only to the extent – that the gap between revenue and spending is cyclical ( that is , its economy is operating below potential due to temporary negative shocks ) . in other words , the target is cyclically adjusted .
there is no reason to doubt that the member states will follow through and adopt national rules by the end of the year . the problem is what comes after that : the risk that the fiscal compact will founder on precisely the same shoals as the SGP .
ever since the eurozone was established , its members have issued official fiscal forecasts that are systematically biased in the optimistic direction . other countries do this , too , but the bias among eurozone countries is , if anything , even worse than it is elsewhere .
during an economic expansion , such as in the 2002-2007 period , governments are tempted to forecast that the boom will continue indefinitely . forecasts for tax revenue and budget surpluses are correspondingly optimistic and so hide the need for fiscal adjustment .
but , if forecasts are biased , fiscal rules will not constrain budget deficits . &amp; # 160 ; In any given year , governments can forecast that their growth rates , tax revenues , and budget balances will improve in subsequent years , and then argue the following year that the shortfalls were unexpected .
indeed , in a new paper , co-authored with Jesse Schreger , we show that eurozone members ’ bias in official forecasts can be neatly characterized as responding to the SGP ’ s 3 % -of-GDP limit on budget deficits in 1999-2011 : each time governments exceeded the limit , over-optimistic forecasts followed . in other words , governments adjust their forecasts , not their policies .
in a year when a forecast for the structural budget deficit turns out to have been over-optimistic , the government can still claim that its own calculations show the shortfall to have been cyclical rather than structural . after all , estimation of potential output – and hence the cyclical versus structural decomposition of the fiscal position – is notoriously difficult , even after the fact .
perhaps it will help that , under the fiscal compact , the rules are to be adopted at the national level , as opposed to the SGP , which operated on the supranational level . a look at the various rules and institutions that European countries have already tried shows that some work and others do not .
creating an independent fiscal institution that provides its own budget forecasts works , insofar as it reduces the bias in deficit projections . when forecasting while in violation of the eurozone ’ s Excessive Deficit Procedure , eurozone members with an independent budget-forecasting institution have a mean bias that is 2.7 % of GDP smaller at the one-year horizon than members without such an institution .
it would be better still if governments were legally bound to use these independent forecasts in their budget plans ( borrowing an innovation from Chile ) .
one trick is privatization of government enterprises , which reduces the budget deficit in a given year on a one-time basis , but might increase the deficit in the long run if the enterprise had been profitable . another trick is to legislate tax cuts that are “ temporary , ” in order to make future revenues look larger , despite the intention to make the cuts permanent before they expire .
other things being equal , the right institutions can curbpro-cyclical fiscal policies – tax cuts and spending hikes during booms and austerity during downturns – in the short run , while helping to deliver debt sustainability in the long run . these institutions include independent fiscal-forecasting agencies , combined with the cyclically adjusted budget targets that the eurozone ’ s fiscal compact mandates .
will Ex-Mexicans Choose America ’ s Next President ?
this is one reason why I wrote a short but – I hope – useful book on Mexican immigration to the United States , entitled Ex-Mex : from Migrants to Immigrants . based on internal documents from the Mexican and US governments , countless interviews , and a survey of much of the existing literature on the subject , Ex-Mex seeks to fulfill three purposes .
first , I wanted to provide a Mexican voice in the immigration debate . Mexicans make up more than half of the flow and stock – legal or not – of all immigrants in the US , but a point of view attempting to reflect their interests and aspirations has been largely absent from the American discussion .
of course , my book cannot be the Mexican stance . but an assessment from the vantage point of past , current , and future Mexican immigrants to the US is a necessary component of the American debate – all the more so when one recalls that immigration has , in fact , not generally been exclusively a domestic US policy question .
the first American immigration agreement with another country was signed in 1907 – the so-called Gentleman ’ s Agreement with Japan , while the US and Mexico negotiated and administered the Bracero Program for more than twenty years , from 1942 thru 1964 . and , of course , the US has had a standing immigration agreement since 1965 with a country most Americans would not imagine : Fidel Castro ’ s Cuba .
second , it is important to place the current , raging debate in historical context . the most important feature of that context is that the actual flow of Mexicans entering the US today is not much greater than the overall average figure for the Bracero Program period : around 400,000 per year .
it is similarly important to understand the evolution of US legislation on immigration since the 1920 ’ s , and the shifts and hypocrisy involved in the application of those laws . for example , the 1996 immigration reforms implemented by the Clinton administration , along with other , underlying structural trends , halted the traditional circular pattern whereby Mexicans came and went to the US every year .
the US , and particularly then-Secretary of State Colin Powell , was willing , as stated in a unclassified memo addressed to Bush in late August 2001 , to go to great lengths to reach an understanding with Mexico on the issue . indeed , the substance of the negotiations was not much different from the content of the Bush-Kennedy “ grand bargain ” that was fashioned in 2007 .
the electoral numbers perhaps best explain the immigration equation ’ s importance in today ’ s presidential campaigns . in 2008 , it is likely that Latinos will make up 9 % to 10 % of the electorate , the highest share ever .
having made significant inroads among Hispanic voters in 2000 and 2004 , thanks to Bush ’ s support for immigration reform , Republicans now can barely count on 20 % of that total – mainly among Cuban-Americans – thanks to their strident anti-immigration stance . thus , if the Democrats demonstrate a minimum of compassion , sensitivity , and realism , they can count on a 7 % advantage in the popular vote .
but doing so could cost Democrats dearly in old industrial states like Pennsylvania , Ohio , and Michigan , where the arrival of Mexican migrants , transformed into immigrants , has stoked passions . since the Democrats ’ victory will most likely depend on these states , the Democratic candidate who can square this circle , or the Republican who can break it , may well win the presidency .
will Global Imbalances Return ?
Beijing – Future history books , depending on where they are written , will take one of two approaches to assigning blame for the world ’ s current financial and economic crisis .
the other , already being pushed by former and current US officials like Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke , will blame the immense pool of liquidity generated by high-savings countries in East Asia and the Middle East . all that liquidity , they will argue , had to go somewhere . its logical destination was the country with the deepest financial markets , the US , where it raised asset prices to unsustainable heights .
note the one thing on which members of both camps agree : the global savings imbalance – low savings in the US and high savings in China and other emerging markets – played a key role in the crisis by allowing Americans to live beyond their means . it encouraged financiers desperate to earn a return on abundant funds to put them to more speculative use .
the US trade deficit has declined from $ 60 billion a month to just $ 26 billion , according to the most recent data . as a matter of simple arithmetic , we know that the rest of the world is running correspondingly smaller surpluses .
indeed , the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve are doing all they can to pump up US spending . the only reason the US trade deficit is falling is that the country remains in a severe recession , causing US imports and exports to collapse in parallel .
with recovery , both may recover to previous levels , and the 6 % -of-GDP US external deficit will be back . in fact , there has been no change in relative prices or depreciation of the US dollar of a magnitude that would augur a permanent shift in trade and spending patterns .
whether there is a permanent reduction in global imbalances will depend mainly on decisions taken outside the US , specifically in countries like China . one ’ s forecast of those decisions hinges , in turn , on why these other countries came to run such large surpluses in the first place .
one view is that their surpluses were a corollary of the policies favoring export-led growth that worked so well for so long . China ’ s leaders are understandably reluctant to abandon a tried-and-true model . they can ’ t restructure their economy instantaneously .
what China lacked was not demand for consumption goods , but a supply of high-quality financial assets . it found these in the US , mainly in the form Treasury and other government-backed securities , in turn pushing other investors into more speculative investments .
recent events have not enhanced the stature of the US as a supplier of high-quality assets . and China , for its part , will continue to develop its financial markets and its capacity to generate high-quality financial assets internally .
one development that could change this forecast is if China comes to view investing in US financial assets as a money-losing proposition . US budget deficits as far as the eye can see might excite fear of losses on US Treasury bonds .
one is relying on Chinese goodwill to stabilize the US and world economies . the other is for the Obama administration and the Fed to provide details about how they will eliminate the budget deficit and avoid inflation once the recession ends .
will Governmental Folly Now Allow for a Cyber Crisis ?
Cambridge – When the financial crisis of 2008 hit , many shocked critics asked why markets , regulators , and financial experts failed to see it coming . today , one might ask the same question about the global economy ’ s vulnerability to cyber-attack .
although the greatest cyber threat comes from rogue states with the capacity to develop extremely sophisticated computer viruses , risks can also come from anarchistic hackers and terrorists , or even from computer glitches compounded by natural catastrophe .
a few security experts have voiced great alarm , including , most recently , Jonathan Evans , the head of the British Security Service ( MI5 ) . by and large , however , few leaders are willing to compromise growth in the tech sector or the Internet in any significant way in the name of a threat that is so amorphous .
it is difficult to overstate the dependence of modern economies on large-scale computer systems . but imagine if one day a host of key communications satellites were incapacitated , or the databases of major financial systems were erased .
true , many skeptics argue that with reasonable low-cost prophylactic measures , large scale cyber-meltdowns are highly implausible , and that doom-mongers overstate the worst-case scenarios . they say that the ability of cyber-terrorists and blackmailers to take the global economy to the brink , as in the 2007 Bruce Willis movie Die Hard 4 , is utterly fictional .
it is difficult to judge who is right , and there are important experts on both sides of the debate . but there do seem to be an uncomfortable number of similarities between the political economy of cyberspace regulation and of financial regulation .
first , both cyber-security and financial stability are extremely complex topics with which government regulators can hardly keep up . industry remuneration for experts is far in excess of any public-sector salary , and the best minds are continually bid away .
in the United States , all presidential candidates must make pilgrimages to Silicon Valley and other tech centers to raise money . excessive financial-sector influence was , of course , a root cause of the 2008 meltdown and remains deeply implicated in today ’ s continuing eurozone mess .
third , with slowing growth in advanced economies , information technology seems to hold the moral high ground , just as finance did until five years ago . and crude attempts by governments to enforce regulation are likely to prove ineffective in protecting against catastrophe , while all too effective in strangling growth .
in both cases – financial stability and cyber security – the risk of contagion creates a situation in which a wedge can form between private incentives and social risks . admittedly , progress in the technology sector overall often produces huge social-welfare gains , which arguably outstrip those produced by all other sectors in recent decades .
both are deeply encrypted and difficult to detect once inside a computer . the Flame virus has the capacity to take over a computer ’ s peripherals , record Skype conversations , take pictures through a computer ’ s camera , and transmit information via Bluetooth to any nearby device .
virus protection and virus development constitute an uneven arms race . a virus can be just a couple hundred lines of computer code , compared to hundreds of thousands of lines for anti-virus programs , which must be designed to detect wide classes of enemies .
we are told not to worry about large-scale cyber meltdowns , because none has occurred , and governments are being vigilant . unfortunately , another lesson of the financial crisis is that most politicians are congenitally incapable of making difficult choices until risks actually materialize .
will Hamas Win the Peace ?
whether Hamas can claim a victory – and whether Palestinians will believe them will be determined by the type of ceasefire that is eventually agreed , if a formal one is eventually agreed . the end game – for both Israel and Hamas – is thus crucially important .
after all , Hamas was democratically elected , but was forbidden from ruling and besieged in Gaza . at the same time , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is accused of siding with Israel in order to restore his lost authority in Gaza .
Hamas apparently did not envision a full-scale confrontation with Israel when it refused to renew a six-month truce . with Gaza suffering under a lengthy siege , Hamas leader Khalid Mashal said that there was no point in a new truce , since the old one had “ failed to lift the siege on Gaza . ”
for Palestinians , these are signs of victory . with open borders , Hamas would secure its regime in Gaza and build its popularity in the West Bank , putting enormous pressure on Abbas , the leader of the rival Fatah movement , to accept a national unity government on terms set by Hamas .
members of Fatah ’ s Central Committee are already accusing Abbas of supporting Israel in the fighting , of wanting to “ return to Gaza on an Israeli tank . ” Radical groups within Fatah are leaning toward an open alliance with Hamas .
Egypt will have to backtrack on its rejection of Hamas in order to recover its image among the Arabs and to reduce tensions within Egyptian society . pressure to integrate Hamas into Palestinian politics is also likely in some European capitals , particularly Paris and London , where some expressed opposition to isolating Hamas even before the war .
Palestinians will ask if it was really necessary to fight this war and pay such a high price . Abbas will be able to argue that he advised Hamas to renew the truce and to end its missile fire on Israeli towns , but that Hamas insisted on exposing Palestinian civilians to devastation .
Palestinians will recognize Hamas ’ s acceptance of a multi-year truce with Israel as a sign of defeat , which would also underscore Palestinian feelings of humiliation and abandonment . Hezbollah , despite its rhetoric , has taken no steps to support Hamas , and the Arab states seemed more than willing to support its defeat .
it is in rebuilding Gaza that the stakes of the competition will increase . Abbas , supported by the United States and the European Union , may have control over significant funding .
there is a precedent for this argument : Hezbollah described the destruction of Beirut ’ s southern suburbs in exactly these terms at the end of the Lebanon War in July 2006 . more importantly , Hamas can demonstrate that its leaders have been on the front lines during this war , sharing Palestinian suffering ; many have been killed , along with their families .
the biggest question is whether the war will alter Hamas ’ political goals . two weeks ago , Musa Abu Marzouk , a senior Hamas official , praised Jimmy Carter in The Los Angeles Times as the only American president who had brought true peace in the Middle East .
this is a radical departure from Hamas rhetoric , which has always portrayed the Camp David agreement between Israel and Egypt as a betrayal of the Islamic world . it remains to be seen whether Abu Marzouk ’ s view is merely a tactic intended to encourage the Obama administration to reach out to Hamas , or whether the war convinced Hamas that the two-state solution is the only viable option to settle the conflict with Israel .
the Framing of MH-17
Philadelphia – US President Barack Obama called the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 an “ outrage of unspeakable proportions , ” whereas Russian President Vladimir Putin termed it an “ accident ” and a “ terrible tragedy . ” Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko branded it an “ act of terrorism , ” and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak called it an “ inhumane , uncivilized , violent , and irresponsible act . ”
all of these descriptions may be accurate , but each carries different rhetorical weight and legal implications . the time has come for governments and international organizations to call the attack on MH17 a probable war crime .
Russian media and officials portray the episode as , at best , a terrible mistake , and , at worst , an American plot to undermine support for the rebels . Americans and Europeans , for their part , increasingly blame Russia for possibly equipping or assisting the rebels .
as a result , the possibility of achieving a common understanding of the act is being lost – and , with it , whatever potential there may be for meaningful cooperation . but , by recognizing the downing of MH17 as a war crime , governments may be able to create an opening to reconcile these narratives .
calling the offense by its legal name acknowledges this , thereby preempting a rhetorical battle to frame the attack as terror , tragedy , or conspiracy . even the Russians may be willing to accept this framing , because it avoids finger-pointing against particular actors and affirms that a court of law – not a series of media statements – will determine what occurred and who is responsible .
there is a real danger that those responsible for pressing the launch button – and , perhaps , for ordering the launch – will disappear into the chaos of eastern Ukraine , the vast expanses of Russia , or elsewhere . there is also a danger that the perpetrators , if found , might avoid trial if the local authorities label the crime political , and thus exempt from normal extradition requirements .
all of the relevant states in the region have accepted the legal obligation to assist in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes . the obligation to prosecute suspected war criminals , or extradite them to face prosecution elsewhere , becomes more compelling in accordance with the seriousness of the alleged crime .
indeed , the conflict in eastern Ukraine constitutes a non-international armed conflict ( a war between a government and rebel movement ) governed by international humanitarian law , which categorically bans the intentional targeting of civilians . in other words , if whoever launched the missile did so with the intent of killing the civilian passengers aboard MH17 , the act was unmistakably a war crime .
fundamental to the law of war , including the law applicable in non-international armed conflicts , is the principle of distinction – the requirement that fighting parties distinguish between civilian and military targets . in the words of the International Committee of the Red Cross , that duty of care includes doing “ everything feasible to verify that targets are military objectives . ”
in this case , many steps could easily have been taken to differentiate MH17 from a military-transport plane , including visual identification ( perhaps with binoculars ) , radar-signature analysis , and a check of the civilian aircraft transponder-code broadcast . if , as seems likely , these basic steps were not taken , even an accidental strike on MH17 would constitute a war crime .
a Dutch or Malaysian court , or even a special tribunal under the auspices of the United Nations ( like the one that prosecuted the 1988 Pan Am Lockerbie bombing ) , will ultimately determine who bears legal responsibility for the downing of MH17 . framing the attack as a likely war crime now – as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has done – may help to reconcile the conflicting narratives that are emerging .
China ’ s New Reforms in Theory and Practice
Hong KONG – On November 12 , the Third Plenary of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) announced a major turn to market-oriented policies : interest-rate and currency liberalization , reform of banks and state enterprises , clearer land ownership for rural inhabitants , and a better deal for urban migrants .
China ’ s success has been driven by cheap exports based on cheap labor , infrastructure built by state enterprises with low-cost bank funding , and government budgets funded by land sales . but labor is no longer cheap , road construction to connect major cities has given way to building large shopping malls in small towns , and land sales based on rezoning are reaching both economic limits and the limits of villagers ’ tolerance .
cheap money with limited investment outlets now risks fueling property bubbles and industrial overcapacity . without fundamental change , China faces slower economic growth , inadequate job creation and innovation , and popping bubbles .
the solution is a rapid shift from China ’ s export-based growth model to one based on domestic demand ; from infrastructure to consumption ; from the dominance of large state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) to that of small and medium-size private enterprises ; from industry to services ; and , more broadly , from bureaucratic control to market control .
SOEs will lose their low-interest loans , subsidized land , monopoly protection , and privileged housing . Party and state bureaucracies will lose power ( and income ) .
already squeezed by exorbitant property prices and popular resistance to land takings , they now face higher interest rates , property taxes , villagers empowered by stronger rights , and expensive new requirements to provide social services to migrants . the desperation of local potentates and SOE executives has created powerful resistance to reform .
at a plenary reportedly marked by acrimony , China ’ s political leaders sided with reform . as one economic planner said , when asked about resistance before the decisive meeting , “ In the end , all of our leaders understand numbers .
the Third Plenum ’ s announcement of its decisions took the form of a statement of broad principles , leaving many observers concerned by the lack of detail . but the CCP ’ s role is to set the direction of policy ; executing the Party ’ s decisions is the government ’ s job .
the current 12th Five-Year Plan calls for annual wage increases to average at least 13.4 % ; this year , wages are rising at an average rate of 18 % , which will squeeze out industries characterized by obsolescence or overcapacity . moreover , the government ’ s anti-corruption campaign is targeting some of the most powerful industry groups , such as the petroleum faction , thereby weakening their resistance to reform .
most important , economic outcomes are becoming increasingly aligned with the authorities ’ goals . services already account for more output and employment than industry – the Internet company Alibaba , for example , is empowering both consumers and smaller companies on a previously unimaginable scale – and recent growth has been driven by domestic demand rather than net exports .
economic openings to Central Asia and to ASEAN ( specifically to Vietnam ) are well underway , and reform will include further international opening . the Third Plenum ’ s decisions follow the launch in September of the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone , which will open new sectors to foreign investment and permit largely market-based financial transactions and capital flows .
for trade in goods , the new free-trade zone is intended to compete directly with Singapore and Hong Kong . China fears dependence on those entrepôts in the event of conflict .
President Xi Jinping faces the politically risky task of pushing the CCP ’ s reform agenda against fierce opposition while the economy slows . by emphasizing Party control – through a crackdown on SOEs , government opponents , and critics in the media and academia – Xi seeks to maximize his ability to impose economic reforms while minimizing the risk of a challenge from conservative forces .
and yet China will find it increasingly difficult to postpone stronger measures that would appease popular demands for fairness , including the establishment of an independent judiciary , which could prove to be no less an imperative than structural economic reforms . likewise , the leaders must either accept much of the information revolution ’ s swamping of controls or engage in far more costly repression .
hopes for political reform rest on the possibility that Xi ’ s second term will see the accession to top leadership of reformers like Politburo member Wang Yang and Vice President Li Yuanchao . for now , however , China will focus on another great wave of economic reform .
China ’ s Xi Factor
Hong KONG – Before China ’ s leadership transition earlier this year , experts said that the Chinese Communist Party was intent on preventing a larger-than-life personality from assuming power . the CCP , it was argued , wanted someone more like the bureaucratic outgoing leader , Hu Jintao , rather than a charismatic successor like , say , the former Chongqing provincial governor Bo Xilai .
he began his term by paying homage to Deng Xiaoping at his statue in Shenzhen , where , more than three decades ago , the former Communist Party leader had launched the campaign to convert a reluctant Party to free-market reforms . in a top-level November meeting , Xi set out the details of a fundamental change in economic direction , overshadowing his colleagues .
Xi now leads a new economic group that will coordinate and impose his reforms on fractious colleagues . and , unlike Hu , he immediately became head of the military and now runs a parallel national security council .
in 1993 , central-government leaders enjoyed relatively limited powers : they did not control the money supply and had difficulty firing provincial governors or relocating top generals . central government revenue was low ; indeed , proportionately smaller than that of central governments in any other major economy .
this changed when then-Party leader Jiang Zemin and his prime minister , Zhu Rongji , centralized authority in order to stave off economic crisis at a time of growing risk to China ’ s banks . in the process , the labor force of China ’ s state enterprises declined by 50 million , China lost 25 million manufacturing jobs , and central-government employment was slashed .
popular reaction against the cosmopolitan , coastal , and market-oriented reforms of Zhu and Jiang brought to power leaders whose formative experiences were in the inland provinces of Gansu and Tibet . riding a wave of resentment against inequality and social tensions , Hu and his prime minister , Wen Jiabao , promised a “ harmonious society , ” without the stresses of Zhu ’ s agenda .
investment in infrastructure was shifting from growth-enhancing projects , such as inter-city highways , to less productive shopping malls in second- and third-tier cities . productivity plummeted in SOEs , whose privileged access to financing crowded out private-sector investment .
thus , it became essential to launch a new wave of far-reaching reforms , including liberalization of interest rates , securities markets , and foreign-exchange controls , in order to fund the more productive private sector and reduce excess capacity in SOEs . in particular , the reforms were needed to deflate an emerging property bubble resulting from huge savings and foreign capital inflows that had no other profitable investment outlet .
the government planned to liberalize interest rates and the capital account to encourage investment in modern , high-value industries , rather than continue to subsidize low-value exports . it started to shift the economy ’ s base from export-oriented industries to domestic growth , and from manufacturing to services .
highly leveraged local governments could not tolerate higher interest rates or an appreciating currency , and they were adamant about continuing land sales and opposing property taxes . they feared the financial burden of new requirements to provide social services to urban migrants .
the new lineup eliminated the most powerful voice on the left ( Bo ) and relegated the “ extreme reformers ” on the right ( Li Yuanchao and Wang Yang ) to the second tier . to reduce elders ’ interference , Hu stepped down as head of the military and Jiang Zemin promised to step back .
moreover , a leading economic group was established to enforce bureaucratic compliance , as was a national security council ( similar to that in the United States ) to coordinate foreign policy . previously , the military often kept the foreign ministry in the dark ; and the party ’ s foreign-affairs office , which handled North Korea , often failed to coordinate its activities with the foreign ministry , which handled South Korea .
in short , the new-style leadership , a form of managed charisma , was collectively designed to serve national needs . and it implies that Xi is unlikely to emerge as paramount leader .
desperate Women ’ s Dangerous Moves
Geneva – One of the most significant recent trends in migration has been the rise in the number of women using dangerous routes previously used mainly by men . more and more women – fleeing discrimination , violence , or poverty – are now taking the same risks as men in search of a better life for themselves and their children .
indeed , while many women travel with their families , the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) is seeing an increasing number of women migrating on their own to an unknown , unpredictable , and often dangerous future . women and children migrants are dying with increasing frequency at sea , crossing deserts , and on other hazardous routes .
what has changed ?
but poverty is almost always the strongest force driving women to leave . in most poor countries , women are poorer than men , owing to the systematic discrimination that they face in education , health care , employment , and control of assets .
of course , most migrant women do not encounter mistreatment or die on their journeys ; in fact , many derive real benefits from migration . but , among the world ’ s estimated 111 million migrant women ( half the total ) , violence and abuse can occur at any time , starting from the very outset of the migration process .
throughout the migration cycle , women are more at risk from physical violence by fellow migrants , smugglers , and state officers , and can be forced to exchange sex for transportation , food , or accommodation . unsurprisingly , migrant women are often victims of human trafficking , finding themselves enslaved as laborers , prostitutes , or participants in organized begging operations .
displaced women , often destitute , are easy prey for criminals . this was one of my immediate concerns when Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines , and at my request a special program was instituted to alert and help women in peril .
they are predominantly employed in domestic work , care-giving , agriculture , and entertainment – all low-paid , largely unregulated sectors that are rarely covered by national labor laws . they are often subject to punishingly long working hours , non-payment of wages , forced confinement , starvation , beating , sexual abuse , and threats and intimidation .
many women migrants are unskilled or undocumented domestic workers . this makes them more vulnerable to violence , because they typically depend on a single employer and in many countries face deportation if they attempt to change jobs .
this is partly because women are often subject to harmful traditional practices , such as early and forced marriage , female genital mutilation , and so-called “ honor ” crimes , enforced by families who want to maintain a link with their country of origin . and it is especially difficult for women migrants to navigate between the tantalizing freedom of choice and expression in their host society and the traditional roles expected of them at home .
the rising number of migrant deaths – both women and men – at sea and in deserts is a wake-up call for the international community to act . IOM has called on all relevant actors – including countries of origin , transit countries , and destination countries – to address the plight of migrants attempting life-threatening journeys and find solutions .
in 2014 , the international community will review the United Nations Millennium Development Goals , which expire next year , and decide on a post-2015 development agenda . IOM believes that migrants , and in particular women migrants , who in the past have been largely invisible in the language of development , must be a part of this .
we must no longer ignore half the world ’ s migrants . like all migrants , women on the move are entitled to personal security and basic dignity .
will NATO ’ s Prodigal Son Return ?
few state visits have lasting results . Nicolas Sarkozy ’ s just completed trip to Washington may be an exception , because the French President may be preparing to bring NATO a highly valued present for its 60th anniversary in the spring of 2009 : France ’ s return to NATO ’ s integrated military structure , from which Charles de Gaulle withdrew in 1966 .
in retrospect , de Gaulle ’ s decision proved to be much more detrimental for France than for the Alliance . by withdrawing from NATO ’ s integrated military command , France excluded itself from political decision-making within the Alliance and thus became the equivalent of the “ Harkis ” – the local soldiers who served with the French army during the Algerian war : fine soldiers , but with virtually no reward for their service .
historically , aborted moves and faux pas abound on both sides in the French / NATO relationship , the latest being Jacques Chirac ’ s failed attempt to patch up France ’ s relations with NATO upon his arrival in power in 1995 . success is not guaranteed this time , either , but the chances are much higher now , because France , the United States , and the world have changed .
to speak of Sarkozy as a substitute for Tony Blair in Europe would be premature – and unhelpful , given Blair ’ s inability to exert significant influence on US policy . but Sarkozy is both eager to transform France ’ s relations with the Alliance and has a strategy to do so .
more Europe in security terms means more Alliance . so , because Sarkozy wants to be seen as a convinced European , he must normalize France ’ s relations with a new Alliance based on two pillars – European and American .
moreover , financial and human resources for military affairs are scarce and cannot be duplicated , while France and Britain want to restart the Saint-Malo process of bilateral defense efforts launched nearly ten years ago . as a result , for the sake of Europe , France must move closer to the Alliance .
Sarkozy has also fully integrated into France ’ s approach to Europe a reckoning with the new balance of power within the European Union following the accession of Eastern European states . unlike Chirac , he understands that it is counterproductive and unrealistic to ask countries like Bulgaria or Romania to choose between their European or Atlantic loyalties .
those divisions are now history , and American reservations about a European security pillar cannot trump America ’ s pressing needs for allied support . confronted with disaster in Iraq , the risk of Afghanistan following Iraq into chaos , and the escalating crisis with Iran , the US can no longer treat the NATO allies with disdain .
beyond the changes in France and the US , the decisive factor behind the possible reinvention of NATO is the transformation of the international system itself . aside from the explosive situation in the Middle East and the threat of Islamist terrorism , the West is now confronted with the rise of Asia , the return of a more assertive Russia , and new energy and environmental challenges .
both France and America have a key role to play in addressing these issues effectively . Sarkozy ’ s trip to Washington , and his address to a receptive US Congress , was one more step toward ensuring that they do so together .
bankers with Borders
London – When Mark Carney replaces Mervyn King as Governor of the Bank of England in July 2013 , the world will be deprived of King ’ s witty public utterances . my personal favorite came when , commenting on strong retail-sales figures during one Christmas period , he cast doubt on their significance for assessing the state of the economy .
they trade globally , across porous borders , attaching little significance to the geographical location of capital and liquidity . but , when the music stops , it is the home regulator , and the home central bank , that picks up the tab , even if the losses were incurred elsewhere .
Icelandic banks , for example , took deposits in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , and swept them back to Reykjavik , leaving the host countries out of pocket . likewise , the collapse of Lehman Brothers left European creditors more exposed than those in the US , whose funds had been wired home to New York on the Friday before the end .
BoE officials declared firmly that they were prepared to trust their American counterparts , and would not step in to grab subsidiaries or assets based in the UK . “ This is a journey that involves trust , ” said BoE Deputy Governor Paul Tucker .
indeed , while the FDIC and the BoE were working on their plan , the US Federal Reserve was developing proposals that will expose overseas banks in the US to a far tighter set of controls , and closer supervision , than they have hitherto experienced . the Fed is seeking to oblige foreign banks to create a holding company to own their separately capitalized subsidiaries , effectively giving the Fed direct oversight of their business .
“ The crisis revealed the resulting risks to US financial stability , ” said Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo . the UK ’ s Financial Services Authority has been invoking the same rationale for requiring foreign banks to establish local subsidiaries , rather than taking deposits or lending through a branch of the parent bank .
on the face of it , these moves appear to be well justified , given the mayhem created by poorly regulated banks in the major financial centers . but we should be clear that these changes are not just tinkering at the edges .
Ernest Patrikis , a former Fed supervisor , points to the clear implication that in the US domestic banks will have a strong advantage over foreign banks . more dramatically , he asserts that “ subsidiarization would be the end of international banking . ”
Larry Fink , the CEO of the multinational investment-management firm BlackRock , takes a similar view : “ It really throws into question &#91; the &#93; whole globalization of these firms , ” with “ each country for &#91; itself &#93; . ” He adds : “ I wouldn ’ t call it a trade war , but I would certainly call it a high level of protectionism . ”
and it is difficult to deny that the Fed should take a close interest in the funding strategies of foreign banks operating in the US . another Fed governor , Jeremy Stein , has pointed out that foreign banks have dollar liabilities of roughly $ 8 trillion , much of it short-term wholesale funding .
forced subsidiarization causes capital and liquidity to be trapped in local legal entities , reducing the effectiveness with which that capital is used . at a time when bank capital is scarce , that impediment carries significant economic costs .
moreover , tools that may be used wisely and well by institutions with a global outlook , like the Fed and the Bank of England , could take on a different character in countries where a commitment to free and open markets cannot be taken for granted . so we must hope that the US and British authorities move carefully and do not use their new powers to freeze out foreign competition .
will Next Time Be Different ?
Chicago – Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff , in their excellent , eponymous book on debt crises , argue that the most dangerous words in any language are “ This time is different . ” Perhaps the next most dangerous words are “ Next time will be different . ”
these words are often uttered when politicians and central banks want to bail out some troubled segment of the economy . “ Yes , ” one can almost hear them saying , “ we understand that bailing out banks will subvert market discipline .
the public rewards them for dealing with the problem at hand – whether building levees to protect houses built on a flood plain or rescuing banks that have dodgy securities on their balance sheets . politicians and central bankers gain little by letting the greedy or careless face the full consequences of their actions , for many innocent people would suffer as well .
when asked to choose between the risk of being known to posterity as the central banker who let the system collapse and the intangible future benefits of teaching risk takers a lesson , it does not take genius to predict the central banker ’ s decision . democracy tends to institutionalize moral hazard in sectors that are economically or politically important , such as finance or real estate , allowing them to privatize gains and socialize losses .
even though the authorities insist that the next time will be different , everyone knows that they will make the same decision when confronted with the same choice again . so , knowing that next time will not be different , the authorities try their best to prevent a “ next time . ”
for one thing , risk takers are typically small , cohesive interest groups that , once rescued , have a powerful incentive , as well as the resources , to buy the political influence needed to ensure a return to the status quo ante . if risk takers were allowed to face more serious losses , they would have fewer resources to fight political attempts to constrain their risky activities .
even as the United States ’ voluminous Dodd-Frank bill tried to ensure that bankers never subjected American taxpayers to undue risk again , public attention had moved on to the state of the real economy and unemployment . why focus on financial regulation when the risks of an immediate collapse are small , and when the details are so tedious ?
so how can this one-way betting be stopped ? the scary answer may be that it does not end until governments run out of money ( as in Ireland ) or the public runs out of sympathy ( as in Germany vis-à-vis the rest of Europe ) .
to avoid that fate , governments should start by recognizing that the system is programmed to respond to deep distress , and that they can do nothing about it . but they must try to ensure that they do not destroy incentives by doing too much .
for example , the US Federal Reserve has essentially guaranteed the financial sector that if it gets into trouble , ultra-low interest rates will be maintained ( at the expense of savers ) until the sector recovers . in the early to mid-1990 ’ s , rates were kept low because of banks ’ real-estate problems .
it would be difficult for the Fed to respond differently if the financial sector gets into trouble again . but it does not have to maintain ultra-low interest rates after the crisis has passed , especially if those rates have little impact on generating sustainable economic activity .
official US policy is so activist in downturns ( regardless of its effectiveness ) partly because unemployment is so costly to workers – who have little savings , unemployment benefits that run out quickly , and health care that is often tied to a job . a stronger safety net for individuals might allow politicians to accept more corporate or financial-sector distress , and help bolster their claim that next time really will be different .
will Olmert Survive ?
after Israel ’ s inability last summer to achieve a conclusive victory over Hezbollah in southern Lebanon , public pressure forced Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’ s government to appoint a commission to examine the causes of this surprising failure . how could a small militia , numbering less than a few thousand combatants , survive the onslaught of the Middle East ’ s most formidable military machine ?
the commission , headed by retired Supreme Court judge Eliyahu Winograd , has just published its interim report . its criticism of Olmert , Defense Minister Amir Peretz , and Chief-of-Staff Dan Halutz – set forth in a detailed and meticulous 117-page assessment – is harsh , but not surprising .
indeed , the inexperience of the prime minister and the defense minister are unprecedented in Israel ’ s history . Olmert , who stepped into Ariel Sharon ’ s shoes as leader of the new Kadima Party , was considered a competent but lackluster parliamentarian – and later mayor of Jerusalem – who was known more for his polemical style than for his political stature or gravitas .
for most Israelis , even those who voted for him as the bearer of Sharon ’ s legacy after the Gaza disengagement , Olmert thus remained the accidental prime minister . likewise , Peretz , a rabble-rousing but effective trade unionist , surprised all when he won the Labor Party ’ s leadership primary and then chose the defense portfolio over the treasury .
to many , the duo of Olmert and Peretz seemed to invite trouble . precisely because Israelis are aware of the constant security threat facing their country , they have always believed that their leaders should be able to lead Israel in war – but also to ask the military tough questions when diplomacy may fail .
Peretz was unable to gauge the strategic implications of his decisions . and Halutz failed to present the civilian leadership with the full panoply of military options at the army ’ s disposal .
Halutz already resigned a few months ago . but both Olmert and Peretz have declared that , despite the Commission ’ s conclusions , they would not quit : instead , they have vowed to implement the report ’ s many far-reaching substantive recommendations about policy , strategy , and decision-making processes .
their coalition government enjoys a comfortable parliamentary majority ; nor does the political arithmetic imply a viable parliamentary alternative . but public opinion – volatile and angry – calls for both to resign : a public-opinion poll conducted after the Commission published its report indicated that only 14 % of Israelis believe that Olmert should keep his job , while less than 11 % support Peretz .
later this week , demonstrations calling for the government &apos;s resignation are planned , and it will become obviously more difficult for the government to continue to function . there are already rumors about a palace coup within Kadima , aimed at replacing Olmert with either the deputy prime minister , the veteran Shimon Peres , or the popular foreign minister , Tzipi Livni .
if the government were to fall and new elections held , there are strong indications that the winner might be Binyamin Netanyahu , of the right-wing Likud , which was decimated in the 2006 elections , but is now patiently waiting in the wings . many who want Olmert to go would still not welcome a Netanyahu comeback , which may also explain what appears to be an indirect endorsement of Olmert by the United States .
as a result , the prospects for meaningful continuation of Israeli-Palestinian talks look even dimmer than they did before . indeed , the real loser of the 2006 Lebanon war was neither Israel nor Hezbollah , but , at least for the time being , the peace process .
will Rising Interest Rates Torpedo Stock and House Prices ?
interest rates around the world are poised to rise . short-term rates have gone so low since the worldwide recession of 2001 - 1 % and 2 % , respectively , in the United States and the Eurozone , and practically zero in Japan - that a strengthening world economy will force central banks to tighten the monetary reins .
Australia &apos;s central bank has already been raising rates since May 2002 , and Great Britain &apos;s since November 2003 .
in the US , the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting on June 29-30 is likely to mark a major turning point , reversing the steady decline of the benchmark federal funds rate since Alan Greenspan began loosening monetary policy in 2001 . this is likely to be followed by rate increases in China , the Eurozone , and elsewhere .
given the tendency of central banks to change interest rates gradually , any change of direction likely means more changes in the same direction later . what will this landmark change mean for prices of such assets as stocks and homes ?
the higher interest rates go , the better are investments in bonds , which compete with investments in other assets such as stocks or homes . higher interest rates also raise the cost of borrowing to buy these assets , which may diminish demand for them , exerting downward pressure on their prices .
in fact , the history of the stock market &apos;s reactions to changing interest rates is mixed . sometimes interest rate changes have the predicted effect , sometimes they don &apos;t .
for example , the NASDAQ stock price index made a spectacular 14 % jump upwards on the day ( January 3 , 2001 ) when America &apos;s Fed began its latest series of interest rate cuts . a jump in the market is what one might have expected .
does that experience suggest that the NASDAQ index will drop sharply if the Fed raises interest rates on June 30 ?
by contrast , the Fed is widely expected to raise rates at the end this month , so there will be no surprise element . the market may know , not just from the experience of 2001-2 , that interest rate movements do not have predictable effects on stock prices .
but , there are reasons to believe that higher interest rates , even though expected , can have a negative impact on home prices . that is because home buyers are mostly ordinary people with little financial sophistication , unlike the professionals who trade in stocks .
high home prices are already putting great stress on many families , which are struggling to make their mortgage payments . when interest rates go up , these payments will ( when the rate is variable ) also go up , possibly becoming unsustainable .
if one borrows the equivalent of three years &apos; income to buy a house , a mortgage rate of 6 % means that 18 % of one &apos;s income goes to interest payments , which may be tolerable . but if the rate rises to 8 % , mortgage interest payments rise to 24 % , which , together with amortization , taxes , other debts , and necessary expenditures , may claim too much of the family budget .
people with fixed-rate mortgages are also vulnerable to rate increases , though less directly . this is because if they have to move and sell their house , there may be no buyers who can afford higher interest payments , unless the home &apos;s price also falls .
by contrast , sophisticated investors , such as big stock market players , are unlikely to fall prey to this trap . but homebuyers are not as savvy , so they may not see the change coming or they may fail to plan for it .
as psychologists have shown , people are susceptible to &quot; wishful thinking bias , &quot; wishing away possible future problems that they would rather not think about . they may overemphasize the likelihood of economic success ( &quot; I will be making a lot more money in a few years &quot; ) and underemphasize the commonplace problems that regularly challenge family budgets ( &quot; I will be losing my job or getting a divorce &quot; ) .
they only made it easier for people , in those areas of the world where there is a half-believable story about a fabulous future economy , to indulge their fantasies . interest rate increases will deliver a fresh dose of reality : the interest expense of owning a home is going to claim a larger share of family budgets , a hard fact that will eventually sink into our thinking .
but declines in home prices will not occur quickly when central banks begin to raise interest rates . after two years of rate increases , Australia &apos;s home price boom only recently shows signs of abating .
will Success Spoil Brazil ?
Rio DE JANEIRO – Brazil has been making international headlines of late , but not for traditional stories about urban violence , natural catastrophes , political corruption , or deforestation in the Amazon .
at the G-20 Summit in London last April , for example , US President Barack Obama called for the world to pay heed to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , the “ most popular politician on earth , ” and shook hands with him , saying : “ My man right here . I love this guy . ”
in September , the ousted president of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya , reappeared in the country inside the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa after three months of exile . although his presence dramatically fuelled the situation for a time , Brazilian diplomats , working with the US , were able to reach agreement with Honduran authorities to allow Manuel Zelaya to return to office .
then came the news that Brazil will host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games – this coming on top of hosting the 2014 World Cup .
as for the global – and fortunately now abating – economic crisis , Brazil has shined throughout , recording a fast and strong recovery . and , as if this good news were not enough , Brazil ’ s giant state oil company , Petrobrás , is already at work developing two huge deep-water oil fields discovered in the sea off the coast of Rio de Janeiro .
Brazilian democracy , at long last , is working well , following many years of military government , and its economy seems more robust than ever . as a result , many people are enthusiastically pointing to an increased international role for Brazil in the future .
but two connected and major challenges lie ahead for Brazil and its government : the need to build a far more equal society and to resist the temptation to use nationalism to mask whatever domestic failures may manifest themselves .
Brazil ’ s current success is rooted not only in Lula ’ s two terms , which must end in 2010 . the economic stabilization program enacted by Fernando Henrique Cardoso since 1994 ( the Real Plan ) , first as finance minister and then as president for two terms , solidified a structure that made it possible for Lula ’ s tenure to be so prosperous .
his presidency has guaranteed political stability and strengthened social cohesion . indeed , by managing the political process to make the government work for Brazil ’ s people , Lula ’ s administration has made Brazil a truly stable and consensual democracy .
there is nothing modest about that achievement , given Brazil ’ s traditional institutional instability and the series of major corruption scandals that engulfed Lula ’ s government in 2005 and 2006 . Lula survived those scandals and did not move to amend the constitution in order to seek a third term , though some in Brazil pressed him to do so .
this vast transformation has not only generated a virtuous circle that strengthened institutional stability and social capital . it has also differentiated Brazil from other countries in Latin America , putting the country in the forefront in the region in terms of dealing with traditional social and economic injustices in a democratic way .
yet the remaining challenges are huge , for Brazil remains the seventh most unequal society in the world – and severe violence persists . Sixty-four percent of Brazilian homes lack electricity and sanitation , and only 22 % have electricity , a telephone , a computer , a refrigerator , a television , and a washing machine .
America wants to conclude as many free-trade agreements in the region as it can , while Brazil favors expanding its custom union , Mercosul / Mercosur . the entrance of Venezuela into the Brazilian bloc , Brazilian leadership at the United Nations mission in Haiti , and Brazil ’ s role in the Honduran affair are all part of this emerging competition .
if Brazil is to remain on its prosperous path , it must continue to give higher priority to its social and economic programs than to foreign adventures . the construction of a major egalitarian , free , and democratic society that respects and works with the international institutions is the best thing that Brazil can give to the world right now .
will Technology Kill Convergence ?
there is certainly reason for concern – beginning in China . after decades of nearly double-digit growth , China appears to be experiencing a marked slowdown – one that some argue is actually worse than official statistics indicate .
as China ’ s growth slows , so does its demand for oil and commodities , with severe effects for other emerging economies that depend on commodity exports . moreover , the benefits of lower commodity prices do not seem to have materialized among net importers , except perhaps India ; if they have , they have been far from adequate to offset other growth-damaging forces .
as a result , the differential between growth in the emerging and advanced economies – aggregated from IMF data , and including Hong Kong , Singapore , South Korea , and Taiwan in the emerging group – has declined considerably . indeed , after averaging three percentage points for two decades and rising to 4.8 percentage points in 2010 , the percentage-point differential fell to 2.5 last year and is expected to amount to just 1.5 this year .
the question , then , is whether the growth differential will remain as low at it is today . those who believe that it will , typically rely on three arguments , all of which require some qualification .
in a sense , it is actually more the product of the modern services sector than of manufacturing . and there are plenty of untapped opportunities for technological catch-up in , say , health , education , and financial services .
second , emerging-market bears point out that these economies have gained major productivity benefits from the migration of surplus rural labor to urban areas , a surplus that will soon be exhausted . this , too , is true .
the pessimists ’ third argument is that emerging economies are not implementing fast enough the structural reforms needed to support long-term growth . again , there is some truth to this argument : structural reforms are needed everywhere .
but there may be a fourth mechanism at work , related to the changing – and seriously disruptive – nature of new technologies . a major driver of past catch-up , if only in terms of incremental growth , was the shift of many activities in both the services and manufacturing sectors from advanced economies to developing countries with lower wages .
and coding-supported products often have lower costs per unit of output than even very cheap labor can provide . so , whereas call centers , for example , used to be mostly staffed in low-wage countries , now the computer-robot that does most of the talking can be located in New York .
that observation should not , however , overshadow fundamental economic insights – specifically , that trade and the location of production are determined by comparative , not absolute , advantage . a country will always have a comparative advantage in something ; but that something changes .
many advanced countries , for example , now have a comparative advantage in high-value-added activities . in other words , thanks to their highly skilled labor forces , they are better equipped than their developing-country counterparts for activities like the production of made-to-measure specialized goods or , indeed , anything that requires a highly trained team to work in close proximity .
but the technology-induced shifts that are underway could portend big disruptions in global value chains – disruptions affecting both developed and developing countries . in fact , we may have entered a period of fundamental change that could weaken growth everywhere , as the “ old ” shrinks before the “ new ” can occupy sufficient space .
to be sure , the creative destruction that is taking place seems to be affecting developing-economy growth proportionately more than advanced-economy growth , largely because the new technologies are being put to work where they were invented , and developing countries have not yet managed sufficient imitation . but I am not convinced that “ catch-up ” opportunities will remain diminished – not least because it will always be easier to imitate than to invent .
in fact , it could be argued that new “ leap-frogging ” may become possible . as experience in the telecommunications sector shows , the ability to adopt new technologies without first having to dismantle old systems can enable rapid progress .
the key to enabling continued convergence – even at a fairly rapid pace – is good political governance . developing-country governments must implement policies aimed at managing the impending transformation , while maintaining social solidarity and cohesion .
will the Euro Dethrone the Dollar ?
but American spending habits have undermined the dollar ’ s reputation , with the excess supply of dollars on world markets depressing its price . this spring , the euro ’ s exchange rate against the dollar reached an all-time high , and central banks have increased the euro share of their international reserves .
history suggests otherwise , despite a vulnerable dollar .
American financial supremacy in the twenty-first century resembles Britain ’ s position in world finance a century ago . before the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , the pound sterling served as the currency of choice for international transactions , just as the dollar does today , and the world ’ s borrowers visited the City of London to raise capital .
the British economist John Maynard Keynes worried that countries would not use sterling to settle trading balances with each other if the pound were not viewed as a reliable store of value . the “ future position of the City of London , ” according to Keynes , depended on the pound sterling continuing to serve the business world as the equivalent of gold .
the biggest gold outflow in a generation imperiled America ’ s ability to repay its debts abroad . fear that the US would abandon the gold standard sent the dollar plummeting on world markets .
but Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo secured American financial honor in August 1914 by remaining true to gold while everyone else , except for the British , abandoned their obligations . despite the dollar ’ s instant credibility , however , it took more than a decade for America ’ s currency to match Britain ’ s as an international medium of exchange .
Britain ’ s transformation from international creditor to international debtor during the Great War gave the dollar a second wind in its battle with sterling . the British were forced to abandon gold convertibility in April 1919 – a tactical withdrawal intended to pave the way for Britain ’ s return to the former $ 4.8665 parity with the American dollar .
the experience of 1914 implies that a credible alternative can replace an entrenched world currency , especially after an unfavorable balance of trade has weakened it . but even then , dethroning the reigning king of international exchange takes time .
thirteen countries in the European Union use the euro as money . but the commitment of these independent political entities to the euro cannot match the history of America ’ s commitment to the dollar .
it cannot hitch a ride on gold , the way America did a century ago . so the euro must earn its reputation crisis by crisis to confront the dollar ’ s dominance as the currency of choice for international transactions .
meanwhile , the fraction of international reserves held in euros grew from 18 % to 24 % , and the dollar ’ s share dropped from 71 % to 66 % . in short , the euro has clearly made some headway during this period of US balance of payment deficits , but this reflects an evolutionary decline in the dollar ’ s dominance , not a revolutionary regime shift .
while a broad and abrupt sell-off by major foreign holders of dollars – for example , China – appears unlikely , a cataclysmic event , similar to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914 , could prompt a search for a new international medium of exchange . in the modern era of automated payments , the upheaval might come from a terrorist attack that undermines the computerized transfer facilities of the world ’ s banking system .
but exactly what would replace the dollar under such circumstances remains an open question . after all , a loss of computer records would make the euro equally suspect .
will the Euro Survive the Current Crisis ?
Cambridge – The European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) and the euro are about to celebrate their tenth anniversary . the euro was introduced without serious problems and has since functioned well , with the European Central Bank delivering the low inflation that is its sole mandate .
but the current economic crisis may provide a severe test of the euro ’ s ability to survive in more troubled times . while the crisis could strengthen the institutions provided by the EMU , it could also create multiple risks , of which member countries need to be aware if they want to avoid them .
the current differences in the interest rates of euro-zone government bonds show that the financial markets regard a break-up as a real possibility . ten-year government bonds in Greece and Ireland , for example , now pay nearly a full percentage point above the rate on comparable German bonds , and Italy ’ s rate is almost as high .
there have , of course , been many examples in history in which currency unions or single-currency states have broken up . although there are technical and legal reasons why such a split would be harder for an EMU country , there seems little doubt that a country could withdraw if it really wanted to .
the most obvious reason that a country might choose to withdraw is to escape from the one-size-fits-all monetary policy imposed by the single currency . a country that finds its economy very depressed during the next few years , and fears that this will be chronic , might be tempted to leave the EMU in order to ease monetary conditions and devalue its currency .
in a serious downturn , a country may wish to pursue a traditional Keynesian policy through large-scale , deficit-financed fiscal stimulus . although the Stability and Growth Pact may be elastic enough to permit some deficit stimulus , a country may feel constrained from acting as aggressively as it wants .
it remains to be seen how willing the ECB will be to provide national central banks with the volume of euros needed to play this role fully . if a country sees its banks failing because its national bank cannot lend them enough , it may chose to leave the EMU so that its central bank can provide whatever amount of local currency it deems necessary .
moreover , the current economic crisis has led to renewed talk about the need for the European Union to have taxing authority . whatever the logic of that proposition , it would open the door to much greater income redistribution .
even if officials do not want to abandon the euro , they may come to do so as a result of a strategy of trying to get other countries to agree to a policy change . a country that believes that monetary or fiscal policy is too tight may threaten to leave if policy is not changed .
but even if it is one of the smaller countries , it might be a serious threat because it could be seen as the beginning of the end . so either type of country could make the threat in the hope that it would be enough to cause their EMU colleagues to agree to their desired change in policy .
none of these risks implies that the monetary union will inevitably be a victim of this severe economic downturn . but the downturn will be a more severe test for the euro than any that it faced during its first ten years .
will the IMF Stand Up to Europe ?
new Managing Director Christine Lagarde ’ s recent call for forced recapitalization of Europe ’ s bankrupt banking system is a good start . European officials ’ incensed reaction – the banks are fine , they insist , and need only liquidity support – should serve to buttress the Fund ’ s determination to be sensible about Europe .
until now , the Fund has sycophantically supported each new European initiative to rescue the over-indebted eurozone periphery , committing more than $ 100 billion to Greece , Portugal , and Ireland so far . unfortunately , the IMF is risking not only its members ’ money , but , ultimately , its own institutional credibility .
only a year ago , at the IMF ’ s annual meeting in Washington , DC , senior staff were telling anyone who would listen that the whole European sovereign-debt panic was a tempest in a teapot . using slick PowerPoint presentations with titles like “ Default in Today ’ s Advanced Economies : unnecessary , Undesirable , and Unlikely , ” the Fund tried to convince investors that eurozone debt was solid as a rock .
even for Greece , the IMF argued , debt dynamics were not a serious concern , thanks to anticipated growth and reforms . never mind the obvious flaw in the Fund ’ s logic , namely that countries such as Greece and Portugal face policy and implementation risks far more akin to emerging markets than to truly advanced economies such as Germany and the United States .
as the situation deteriorated , one might have guessed that the IMF would mark its beliefs to market , as it were , and adopt a more cautious tone . instead , at the IMF ’ s April 2011 interim meeting , a senior official declared that the Fund now considers troubled Spain to be a core eurozone country like Germany , rather than a peripheral country like Greece , Portugal , or Ireland .
evidently , investors were supposed to infer that for all practical purposes they should think of Spanish and German debt as identical – the old hubris of the eurozone . my own sarcastic reaction was to think , “ Oh , now the IMF thinks that some of the core eurozone countries are a default risk . ”
having served as the IMF ’ s chief economist from 2001 to 2003 , I am familiar with the Fund ’ s need to walk a tightrope between building investor confidence and shaking up complacent policymakers . but it is one thing to be circumspect in the midst of a crisis ; it is quite another to spew nonsense .
what European leaders may want most from the Fund are easy loans and strong rhetorical support . but what Europe really needs is the kind of honest assessment and tough love that the Fund has traditionally offered to its other , less politically influential , clients .
it also stems from an “ us ” and “ them ” mentality that similarly permeates research at the top Wall Street investment houses . analysts who have worked their entire lives only on advanced economies have learned to bet on things going well , because for the couple of decades prior to the crisis , things mostly did go well – very well .
that is why , for example , so many keep assuming that a normal rapid recovery is just around the corner . but the financial crisis should have reminded everyone that the distinction between advanced economies and emerging markets is not a bright red line .
in his recent speech in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke forcefully complained that political paralysis has possibly become the principal impediment to recovery . but analysts accustomed to working on emerging markets understand that such paralysis is very difficult to avoid after a financial crisis .
rather than slavishly believing policymakers ’ assurances , emerging-market researchers have learned to be cynical about official promises . all too often , everything that can be done wrong will be done wrong .
the IMF needs to bring much more of this brand of skepticism to its assessment of eurozone debt dynamics , instead of constantly seeking strained assumptions that would make the debt appear sustainable . anyone looking closely at Europe ’ s complex options for extricating itself from its debt straightjacket should realize that political constraints will be a huge obstacle no matter which route Europe takes .
even outside Europe , the IMF has long given too much credence to sitting governments , rather than focusing on the long-term interests of the country and its people . the Fund is doing Europe ’ s people no favor by failing to push aggressively for a more realistic solution , including dramatic debt write-downs for peripheral eurozone countries and re-allocating core-country guarantees elsewhere .
now that the Fund has squarely acknowledged the huge capital holes in many European banks , it should start pressing forcefully for a comprehensive and credible solution to the eurozone debt crisis , a solution that will involve either partial breakup of the eurozone or fundamental constitutional reform . Europe ’ s future , not to mention the future of the IMF , depends on it .
will the Polluters Pay for Climate Change ?
I am writing this in New York in early August , when the mayor declared a “ heat emergency ” to prevent widespread electricity outages from the expected high use of air conditioners . city employees could face criminal charges if they set their thermostats below 78 degrees Fahrenheit ( 25.5 Celsius ) .
meanwhile California has emerged from its own record-breaking heat wave . for the United States as a whole , the first six months of 2006 were the hottest in more than a century .
the hot northern summer fits well with the release of An Inconvenient Truth , a documentary film featuring former US Vice-President Al Gore . using some remarkable graphs , images , and other information , the film makes a compelling case that our carbon dioxide emissions are causing global warming , or , at the very least , contributing to it , and that we must urgently address the issue .
I deal with the heat by using more energy , which leads to burning more fossil fuel , putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and heating up the planet more . it even happened when I watched An Inconvenient Truth : on a warm evening , the cinema was so chilly that I wished I had brought a jacket .
overwhelmingly , the dead will be those who lack the resources to adapt , to find alternative sources of food , and who do not have access to health care . even in rich countries , it usually isn ’ t the rich who die in natural disasters .
according to United Nations figures , in 2002 per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in the US were 16 times higher than in India , 60 times higher than in Bangladesh , and more than 200 times higher than in Ethiopia , Mali , or Chad . other developed nations with emissions close to those of the US include Australia , Canada , and Luxembourg .
for example , if a factory leaks toxic chemicals into a river that I use to irrigate my farm , killing my crops , I can sue the factory owner . if the rich nations pollute the atmosphere with carbon dioxide , causing my crops to fail because of changing rainfall patterns , or my fields are inundated by a rise in the sea level , shouldn ’ t I also be able to sue ?
Camilla Toulmin , who directs the International Institute for Environment and Development , a London-based NGO , was present at a lecture on climate change that Al Gore gave in June . she asked him what he thought about compensation for those who are hit hardest by climate change , but who have done the least to cause it .
will the Rumsfeld Revolution Continue ?
since 1997 , the United States Congress has required the Department of Defense to undertake a major defense review every four years . the department is currently developing the third such review and will release it later this year .
as a result , it gave only hints of the counterterrorism strategy to come . the 2005 review , by contrast , will represent several years of thinking by the Bush administration , and thus will serve as a key indicator of the future course of American defense policy .
focusing on terrorism , the strategy calls for strengthening the network of international partners seeking to eradicate transnational terrorism , and for direct action against terrorist organizations and their sponsors . ultimately , it seeks to address what President Bush considers the root causes of terrorism , particularly the absence of open political systems and economic opportunity .
today , however , the US military is more likely to be used to stabilize and rebuild failed states , assist partners in countering insurgency and terrorism , control nuclear weapons when regimes collapse , or directly eradicate terrorist organizations and their supporters . this requires a different type of force , and one capable of running a marathon rather than a sprint , sustaining major deployments for extended periods .
the goal is to keep most of the force stationed at home in the US , with a network of lightly-manned bases abroad that can serve as forward operating locations during a crisis or war . rather than being miniature Americas , many of these bases will be operated in conjunction with or by the host nation .
first , how much conventional war-fighting capability should the US military retain ? the goal is to maintain enough to deter aggressors , but not so much that it detracts from other , more likely missions .
second , what will America ’ s relationship with its traditional allies be ? will formal alliances such as NATO remain the centerpiece of American strategy , or will they be superseded by mission-specific coalitions ?
systems such as the F / A-22 Raptor aircraft and the Army ’ s Future Combat System are extraordinarily expensive . at a time when deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan are straining the defense budget and much of the military ’ s existing equipment needs repair or replacement , questions arise as to whether such programs are a good investment .
fourth , what is the appropriate size of the US military ? many defense intellectuals , former military leaders , and politicians believe that America ’ s military , particularly the ground forces , are too small to implement Bush ’ s grand strategy .
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , on the other hand , believes the size of the military is adequate if it is re-organized for maximum efficiency . he is also concerned that an increase in the size of the military will diminish funds available for advanced technology and systems .
the changes underway in American defense policy reflect planning assumptions . the strategy that emerges will be only as strong as these assumptions are accurate .
the upcoming defense review will mandate changes based on events of the past five years , focusing especially on Iraq , Afghanistan , and other aspects of the war on terror . the question is whether future American military missions will replicate those of the past five years .
one hopes that the 2005 Defense Review will address this issue , although it is certain to answer some strategic questions and leave others open to continued debate . in any case , the new review will serve as a roadmap for future US defense policy , thus affecting America ’ s partners and adversaries alike .
will the Sun Still Rise ?
Tokyo – The scale of the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March was far greater than even the authorities ’ worst scenarios foresaw . nearly six months later , the total damage remains difficult to estimate .
and now the country has absorbed another huge blow : another downgrade of its bond ratings . both Moody ’ s and Standard &amp; amp ;
so what policies should be implemented in response to these economic blows ?
last year , Japan ’ s economy grew at a relatively healthy 3 % annual rate , higher than in the United States or the European Union , owing mainly to the fiscal expansion undertaken after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 . but growth in 2011 had been predicted to slow even before the earthquake .
now , with so much fixed capital and infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami , the economy ’ s productive capacity has fallen by an estimated 2 % of GDP . but that may not be a bad thing : prior to the earthquake , Japan had a demand-supply gap of approximately 5 % of GDP .
the Hanshin earthquake in 1995 destroyed capital stock worth 2 % of GDP . this time , the loss is estimated at 3.4 % of GDP , implying a larger increase in domestic demand if the right public policies are pursued .
on the downside , confidence among consumers and investors alike has taken a hit , mainly owing to fears about radiation leakages and power shortages . according to the Japan Center for Economic Research , power-supply disruptions could negatively affect the Japanese economy for the next three years .
I think this view is too optimistic , because I suspect that the government wants to finance its new expenditure with a tax hike . moreover , the extremely sharp contraction in first-quarter GDP may indicate that the disaster ’ s negative impact on the economy was more significant than expected .
indeed , the economy is expected to have shrunk by another 2.6 % year on year in the second quarter , with growth set to resume only in July-September . and , contrary to the government ’ s outlook , the start of economic recovery could be delayed until the end of this year , with medium-term annual growth reaching 1.5- 2 % .
according to Japan ’ s Ministry of Economy , Trade , and Industry , which surveyed firms roughly a month after the earthquake , more than 60 % of production sites in affected areas had already recovered as of April 15 . almost 30 % expected to recover by the summer , and the remaining 10 % foresaw normal operations after the autumn .
but the impact of even a small number of disruptions to supply chains can be highly significant , particularly for the Asia-Pacific region . consider Renesas Electronics , a medium-size company , with ¥ 150 billion ( $ 1.9 billion ) in annual sales , which accounts for more than half of worldwide production of essential micro-computing components for automobiles .
likewise , the chemical manufacturer Kureha ( ¥ 130 billion in annual sales ) has a 70 % share of the global market for adhesive materials for lithium-ion batteries – a small but essential component of cell phones . Nokia in Finland , for example , imports 12 % of its cell-phone components from Japan , and thus could be indirectly affected by the disaster .
indeed , “ BCP ” is set to become a key term in the region ’ s economic discourse . using BCPs to determine alternative producers means that regional economies will be integrated in a new form , with companies establishing cooperative relationships even with their competitors .
the disaster confirmed the traditional view of Japan as a country that combines a dynamic private sector with an anemic public sector and central administration . the government ’ s mistakes in so-called “ risk communication ” regarding the Fukushima nuclear plant , and its slowness in getting necessary aid to people displaced by the disaster , have once again put the stereotype on full display .
in terms of international relations , however , the disaster could improve Japan ’ s bilateral ties with influential countries . for example , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak met with outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan in Fukushima , near the damaged plant – &amp; nbsp ; helping to ease neighboring countries ’ concerns about radiation leakage .
Japan ’ s Self-Defense Forces played an important role in rescue and restoration activities , with about half of its 200,000 personnel dispatched to the damaged area . while this severely weakened Japan ’ s defenses , the US ensured East Asia ’ s security by deploying an aircraft carrier and cruisers , and American forces also searched for missing victims together with the JSDF .
but Japan ’ s neighbors expect rapid reconstruction and normalization , and for that , stronger political leadership is needed . the earthquake and tsunami have confronted Japan with a profound crisis – but also with a rare opportunity to undertake the comprehensive reforms that the country has postponed for far too long .
will the US-Japan Alliance Survive ?
Cambridge – Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the United States-Japan Security Treaty , a central feature of stability in East Asia for half a century . but now , with the Japanese experiencing a period of domestic political uncertainty , and North Korea ’ s nuclear tests and missile launches increasing their anxiety , will Japan reverse its long-standing decision not to seek a national nuclear-deterrent capability ?
in the early 1990 ’ s , many Americans regarded Japan as an economic threat . some people – in both countries – viewed the security alliance as a Cold War relic to be discarded .
in 1996 , the Clinton-Hashimoto Declaration stated that the US-Japan security alliance was the foundation for stability that would allow growing prosperity in post-Cold War East Asia . that approach has continued on a bipartisan basis in the US , and polls show that it retains broad acceptance in Japan .
one is North Korea , whose recent behavior has been clever and deceptive . the North Koreans have violated their agreements , knowing that China , the country with the greatest potential leverage , is most concerned about regime collapse in North Korea , and thus the threat of chaos on its borders .
Japan officially endorses the objective of a non-nuclear world , but it relies on America ’ s extended nuclear deterrent , and wants to avoid being subject to nuclear blackmail from North Korea ( or China ) . the Japanese fear that the credibility of American extended deterrence will be weakened if the US decreases its nuclear forces to parity with China .
rather , it depends on a combination of capability and credibility . during the Cold War , the US was able to defend Berlin because our promise to do so was made credible by the NATO alliance and the presence of American troops , whose lives would be on the line in the event of a Soviet attack .
indeed , the best guarantee of American extended deterrence over Japan remains the presence of nearly 50,000 American troops ( which Japan helps to maintain with generous host-nation support ) . credibility is also enhanced by joint projects such as the development of regional ballistic missile defense .
equally important are American actions that show the high priority that the US gives to the alliance , and its guarantees not to engage in what Japan fears will be “ Japan-passing ” in its relations with Asia . that is why it was so important that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s first trip was to Asia , and her first stop in Japan .
although an important trade partner , China ’ s growing power makes Japan nervous . when re-negotiating the US-Japan security alliance in the 1990 ’ s , Japanese leaders sometimes privately asked me if the US would desert Japan in favor of China .
I responded then ( and today ) that there is little prospect of such a reversal , for two reasons . first , China poses a potential threat , whereas Japan does not .
while Chinese are more free today than at any time in their history , China ’ s political evolution has lagged behind its economic progress . unlike India , China has not solved the problem of political participation .
that is why the strategy of integration , plus a hedge against uncertainty , makes sense for both the US and Japan . indeed , there are strong grounds for the US , Japan , and China to engage in areas of trilateral and other regional cooperation .
third , the US-Japan alliance will have to face a new set of transnational challenges to our vital interests , such as pandemics , terrorism , and human outflows from failed states . chief among these challenges is the threat posed by global warming , with China having surpassed the US as the leading producer of carbon-dioxide emissions ( though not in per capita terms ) .
fortunately , this is an area that plays to Japan ’ s strengths . although some Japanese complain about the unequal nature of the alliance ’ s security components , owing to the limits that Japan has accepted on the use of force , in these new areas , Japan is a stronger partner .
given today ’ s agenda , there is enormous potential for an equal partnership , working with others , in the provision of global public goods that will benefit the US , Japan , and the rest of the world . that is why I remain optimistic about the future of the US-Japan alliance .
renminbi Rising ?
Shanghai – China is increasingly debating whether or not the renminbi should be internationalized , possibly joining the US dollar and the euro as an international vehicle currency ( IVC ) – that is , a currency that other countries use to denominate the prices of their traded goods and international loans . related to this is a debate about whether Shanghai can become a first-tier international financial center ( 1-IFC ) like London and New York .
first , a city can become a 1-IFC only if its national currency is an IVC . but , as London ’ s status shows , a longtime 1-IFC can retain its position in the international financial system even if its currency is no longer an IVC .
second , the transaction cost of using a foreign currency as a medium of exchange is inversely proportional to the extent to which that currency is used globally . similar economies of scale characterize foreign investors ’ use of a particular international financial center .
third , a country ’ s financial sector must be both open , with no capital-flow restrictions , and sophisticated , with a wide range of instruments and institutions . it must also be safe , with a central bank maintaining economic stability , prudential regulators keeping fraud and speculation in check , macro-prudential authorities displaying adequate financial fire-fighting capabilities , and a legal system that is predictable , transparent , and fair .
last – and most important – successful convergence to IVC and 1-IFC status requires the national economy to be strong relative to other economies for a substantial period of time . the United Kingdom occupied a position of global economic leadership for more than a century .
relative economic strength explains why the Japanese yen failed to develop into an IVC , and why Tokyo – whose financial markets satisfied the relevant requirements – failed to become a 1-IFC . with its GDP reaching only about 60 % of America ’ s at its peak in 1991 , Japan never attained the critical mass required to induce foreigners to use the yen to lower transaction costs .
determining the future international status of the renminbi and Shanghai must begin with a calculation of China ’ s expected relative economic strength vis-à-vis the US under two plausible scenarios .
in the first scenario , China becomes caught in a middle-income trap , with per capita GDP stuck at 30 % of America ’ s – an outcome that has characterized Latin America ’ s five largest economies since at least 1960 , and Malaysia since 1994 . this would put China ’ s economic strength relative to the US at 1.1 – well below the necessary ratio .
in the second , more favorable scenario , China ’ s per capita GDP would reach 80 % of America ’ s – higher than the 70 % average rate for the five largest Western European countries since 1960 – and its economic strength relative to the US would amount to roughly 2.8 . this would make the renminbi eligible for IVC status and enable Shanghai to choose whether to become a 1-IFC .
given this , the Chinese government would have to implement decisive measures to encourage international traders and creditors to price their transactions in renminbi . specifically , China would have to use its market power to promote pricing in renminbi for relevant manufactured exports and raw-material imports , and encourage renminbi denomination of foreign financial assets that China purchases ( which the country ’ s status as a net creditor should facilitate ) .
but there are serious pitfalls to avoid in this process . as the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 demonstrated , capital-account liberalization could lead to financial meltdowns – a danger that opponents of internationalizing the renminbi often cite .
on the contrary , developing and enacting financial regulation must be a gradual process , shaped by both existing knowledge and firsthand experience . after all , no financial market is either completely open or completely closed forever ; the degree of openness at a given moment depends on policy choices .
the recent establishment of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone will allow for the emergence of an offshore international financial center that offers real-world training to China ’ s regulators . this will give them the tools they need to recognize the signs of a developing crisis , defuse the threat , and efficiently handle the recapitalization and reorganization of failed financial institutions .
China ’ s pursuit of an IVC and a 1-IFC city would serve not only its own interests . allowing the renminbi to help meet global demand for international reserves and risk diversification would also strengthen global financial stability .
there is little time to waste in internationalizing the renminbi . given the limited number of currencies that can serve as IVCs , the failure of the renminbi to achieve IVC status before , say , the Indian rupee , the Russian ruble , or the Brazilian real could mean that the renminbi is denied IVC status – and that Shanghai fails to achieve 1-IFC status – for generations , if not forever .
winners and Losers in the Post-9 / 11 Era
just as the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9 , 1989 , signified the Cold War ’ s end , al-Qaeda ’ s attack on the United States opened a new epoch . a non-governmental group killed more Americans that day than the government of Japan did with its surprise attack on another transformative date , December 7 , 1941 .
extremists kill innocent people in order to dramatize their message in a way that shocks and horrifies their intended audience . they also rely on what Clark McCauley and others have called “ jujitsu politics , ” in which a smaller fighter uses the strength of the larger opponent to defeat him .
in that sense , bin Laden hoped that the US would be lured into a bloody war in Afghanistan , similar to the Soviet intervention two decades earlier , which had created such a fertile recruiting ground for jihadists . but the Americans used a modest amount of force to remove the Taliban government , avoided disproportionate civilian casualties , and were able to create an indigenous political framework .
while far from perfect , the first round in the fight went to the US . al-Qaeda lost the sanctuaries from which it planned its attacks ; many of its leaders were killed or captured ; and its central communications were severely disrupted .
then the Bush administration succumbed to hubris and made the colossal mistake of invading Iraq without broad international support . Iraq provided the symbols , civilian casualties , and recruiting ground that the jihadi extremists had sought in Afghanistan .
with the help of the Internet , its symbols and training materials became easily available around the world . whether al-Qaeda had a direct role in the Madrid and London bombings , or the recent plot to blow up airliners over the Atlantic , is less important than the way it has been transformed into a powerful “ brand . ”
that will require more use of the soft power of attraction rather than relying so heavily on hard military power , as the Bush administration has done . for the struggle is not a clash of Islam vs. the West , but a civil war within Islam between a minority of terrorists and a larger mainstream of non-violent believers .
jihadi extremism cannot be defeated unless the mainstream wins . military force , intelligence , and international police cooperation needs to be used against hardcore terrorists affiliated with or inspired by al-Qaeda , but soft power is essential to attracting the mainstream and drying up support for the extremists .
US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld once said that the measure of success in this war is whether the number of terrorists we are killing and deterring is larger than the number that the terrorists are recruiting . by this standard , we are doing badly .
we are also failing in the application of soft power . according to Caslen , “ We in the Pentagon are behind our adversaries in the use of communication – either to recruit or train . ”
when Israel launched a lengthy bombing campaign in Lebanon last month , it created so many civilian casualties that the early criticisms of Hezbollah by Egypt , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia became untenable in Arab politics . when terrorist excesses killed innocent Muslim civilians such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad did in 1993 or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi did in Amman in 2005 , they undercut their own soft power and lost support .
the most important lesson five years after 9 / 11 is that failure to combine hard and soft power effectively in the struggle against jihadi terrorism will lead us into the trap set by those who want a clash of civilizations . Muslims , including Islamists , have a diversity of views , so we need to be wary of strategies that help our enemies by uniting disparate forces behind one banner .
the Middle East ’ s Lost Decade
Berlin – The United States has waged three wars since Al Qaeda ’ s terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 : against Al Qaeda , in Afghanistan , and in Iraq . the first two were forced upon the US , but the third was the result of a willful , deliberate decision by former President George W. Bush , taken on ideological grounds and , most likely , for personal reasons as well .
had Bush , former Vice President Dick Cheney , former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , and their neocon allies been forthright about their intentions – to bring down Saddam Hussein by means of war , thereby creating a new , pro-Western Middle East – they never would have received the support of Congress and the American public . their vision was both naive and reckless .
so a threat – Iraqi weapons of mass destruction – had to be created . as we now know , the threat was based on lies ( aluminum tubes for a nuclear-weapons program , for example , meetings between the 9 / 11 plot leader , Mohamed Atta , and Iraqi officials in Prague , and even glaring forgeries like supposed Iraqi orders for yellowcake uranium from Niger ) .
such were the justifications for a war that was to claim the lives of almost 5,000 US soldiers and more than 100,000 Iraqis . add to that the millions more who were injured and displaced from their homes , as well as the destruction of one of the world ’ s oldest Christian communities .
Bush ’ s war against Saddam did radically change the Middle East , though not as he envisaged . for starters , if the US had set out to destabilize Iraq , its efforts could hardly have been more successful : ten years later , the country ’ s viability as a single state has never been in greater doubt .
with Saddam gone , Iraq ’ s Shia majority assumed power after a horrendous civil war , leaving Iraq ’ s defeated Sunnis longing for revenge and waiting for an opportunity to regain their ascendancy . the Kurds in the north cleverly and adeptly used the window of opportunity that opened before them to seize de facto independence , though the key question of control over the northern city of Kirkuk remains a ticking time bomb .
taking stock of “ Operation Iraqi Freedom ” a decade later , the Financial Times concluded that the US won the war , Iran won the peace , and Turkey won the contracts . I can only agree .
in political terms , Iran is the big winner of Bush ’ s war . its number-one enemy , Saddam , was dispatched by its number-two enemy , the United States , which presented Iran with a golden opportunity to extend its influence beyond its western border for the first time since 1746 .
Bush ’ s war , with its poor strategic vision and worse planning , increased Iran ’ s regional standing in a way that the country was unlikely ever to have achieved on its own . the war enabled Iran to assert itself as the dominant power in the Gulf and the wider region , and its nuclear program serves precisely these ambitions .
the losers in the region are also clear : Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states , which feel existentially threatened , and have come to regard their own Shia minorities as an Iranian fifth column . they have a point : with the Shia in power in Iraq , Iran will seek suitable opportunities to use local Shia populations as proxies to assert its hegemonic claims .
leaving aside the lies , fictions , and questions of morality and personal responsibility , the critical mistake of America ’ s war against Iraq was the absence of either a viable plan or the necessary strength to enforce a Pax Americana in the Middle East . America was powerful enough to destabilize the existing regional order , but not powerful enough to establish a new one .
the Iraq war also marked the beginning of America ’ s subsequent relative decline . Bush squandered a large part of America ’ s military strength in Mesopotamia for an ideological fiction – strength that is sorely missed in the region ten years later .
while there is no causal link between the Iraq war and the Arab revolutions that began in December 2010 , their implications have combined in a malign manner . since the war , the bitter enmities between Al Qaeda and other Salafist and Sunni Arab nationalist groups have given way to cooperation or even mergers .
and the regional destabilization triggered by the Arab revolutions is increasingly converging on Iraq , mainly via Syria and Iran . indeed , the gravest current danger to the region is a process of national disintegration emanating from the Syrian civil war , which is threatening to spread not only to Iraq , but also to Lebanon and Jordan .
what makes Syria ’ s civil war so dangerous is that the players on the ground are no longer its driving forces . rather , the war has become a struggle for regional dominance between Iran on one side and Saudi Arabia , Qatar , and Turkey on the other .
winning the Confidence Game
new HAVEN – On April 2 , the G-20 will hold a summit in London to discuss what we may hope will be an internationally coordinated plan to address the world economic crisis . but can such a plan really work ?
a contemporary observer , Winthrop Case , explained it all in 1938 : economic revival depended “ on the willingness of individual and corporate buyers to make purchases that necessarily tie up their resources for a considerable length of time . for the individual , this implies confidence in the job , and in the end comes equally back to the confidence of industry leaders . ”
if the leaders meeting in London are to succeed where governments failed in the 1930 ’ s , they must commit themselves to a fiscal target that is sufficient to restore full employment under normal credit conditions . they must also commit themselves to a credit target that will restore lending to normal .
people need to believe that the money represents something more lasting than stimulus measures , which may eventually end in failure . after all , the Great Depression did not end simply because of the massive stimulus of war-related expenditures .
to be sure , World War II reduced the unemployment rate in the United States dramatically , from 15 % in 1940 to 1 % in 1944 , and had a similar effect in other countries . but this was not because of a revival in business confidence .
the real recovery of confidence did not occur until after World War II , when the world did not sink back into depression . the US Council of Economic Advisors warned of this possibility in 1949 , and it was not alone .
first , there was a general perception of “ pent-up demand . ” After years of privation ( and in many countries the physical destruction of war ) , people just wanted to live normally – to rebuild , own a home , a car , and other consumer goods .
the widespread impression that there was such pent-up demand also led people to believe that there could not be another depression . the perception of pent-up demand was like a powerful economic stimulus package , and it had the advantage that people believed it would be long-lasting .
according to some contemporary observers , however , “ pent-up demand ” was only part of the story . during the brief but deep recession of 1949 , the financial commentator Silvia Porter reflected on the attitudes that led to the 1929 crash : “ We saw nothing wrong – in fact , we saw everything right – with the wild speculative boom and credit inflation that … culminated in the now almost unbelievable gambling orgy of 1929 . ”
but now , Porter wrote , after the depression and war , “ We began to listen to the idea that a hundred million citizens , acting through a central government , could achieve much more than a hundred million acting as separate selfish units . we developed , in short , a new attitude toward the responsibilities of government . ”
the US gave billions of dollars of aid to rebuild war-ravaged countries in Europe . the plan was widely viewed as reflecting a new kind of enlightenment , a recognition of the importance of supporting people who needed help .
after the war , Keynesian economic theory , which was generally not accepted or understood during the Great Depression , became the basis of a new social compact . it was a theory that was perfectly suited to a generation that had just endured exceptional sacrifices , for it reaffirmed a belief in our responsibility for each other .
the countries represented must show a generous spirit and make the world economy work for all people . seemingly peripheral issues , like aid to the developing world and the poor , who suffer the most from a crisis like this one , will be part of the primary story of the renewal of confidence , just as the Marshall Plan was part of that story after World War II .
winning the European Confidence Game
Chicago – If any solution to the European crisis proposed over the next few days is to restore confidence to the sovereign-bond markets , it will have to be both economically viable and politically palatable to rescuers and rescued alike . this means paying attention not just to the plan ’ s technical details , but also to appearances .
first , Italy and Spain will have to come up with credible medium-term plans that will not just restore their fiscal health , but also improve their ability to grow their way out of trouble . while any plan will involve pain for citizens , the markets must deem the pain politically tolerable , at least relative to the alternatives .
it is important that these plans be seen as domestically devised ( though voters will have no illusions about the external and market pressures that have forced their governments to act ) . at the same time , an external agency such as the International Monetary Fund could render the plan more credible by evaluating it for consistency with the country ’ s goals and monitoring its implementation .
but there is an important caveat , which has largely been ignored in public discussions : if this funding is senior to private debt ( as IMF funding typically is ) , it will be harder for these countries to regain access to markets . after all , the more a country borrows in the short term from official sources , the further back in line it pushes private creditors .
in other words , private markets need to be convinced both that there is a low probability of default ( hence the importance of credible plans ) , and that there is some additional loss-bearing capacity in the new funding , so that , if there is a default , outstanding or rolled-over private debt does not have to bear the full brunt .
in an ideal world , distressed countries would default as soon as private markets stopped funding them , and they would impose the losses on private bondholders . in the real world , however , if Italy and Spain are viewed as being solvent , or too big to fail , official funding should be structured so that it gives these countries their best chance to regain market confidence .
this does not mean that official funding should be junior to private debt in any restructuring , for that would require substantially more loss-bearing capacity from the official sector – capacity that is probably not available . indeed , if official funding were junior , it would be providing a larger cushion to private creditors – and thus bailing them out to an even greater extent .
the simplest solution is to treat official funding no differently from private debt – best achieved if official lenders buy sovereign bonds as they are issued ( possibly at a predetermined yield ) and agree to be treated on par with private creditors in a restructuring . as the country regains market confidence , the official funding can be reduced , and eventually the bonds can be sold back to the markets .
if the funding is channeled through the IMF , and is to be treated on par with private debt , the Fund will need a guarantee from the EFSF or strong eurozone countries that it will be indemnified in any restructuring . of course , the IMF ’ s member states might be willing to accept some burden sharing if a sufficient buffer provided by the eurozone were eroded , but that cannot be taken for granted .
once the first two elements of the plan are in place , there should be little need for the third – bond purchases by the ECB in the secondary market in order to narrow interest-rate spreads and provide further confidence . indeed , if the ECB intends to claim preferred-creditor status for any bonds that it buys , it is probably best that it buy very few .
not all banks voluntarily loaded up on distressed government bonds – some were pressured by supervisors , others by governments – but many have made unwise bets . if they are seen as profiting unduly from the rescue , even as they return to their bad old ways of paying for non-performance , they will undermine political support for the rescue – and perhaps even for capitalism .
winning the Peace
Afghanistan ’ s future hangs in the balance as its weak national government struggles to maintain support and legitimacy in the face of a widening insurgency , warlords , the heroin trade , and a disappointed populace . across an arc extending from Afghanistan to East Africa , violence now also surges in Iraq , Lebanon , Somalia , and beyond , to Sudan ’ s Darfur region .
everywhere , politicians , generals , and even diplomats talk of military strategies and maneuvers , but everywhere something utterly different is needed . stability will come only when economic opportunities exist , when a bulging generation of young men can find jobs and support families , rather than seeking their fortune in violence .
we are seeing again and again that a foreign army , whether NATO ’ s in Afghanistan , America ’ s in Iraq , Israel ’ s in occupied Palestine , or Ethiopia ’ s in Somalia , may win a battle , or even a war , but never the peace . peace is about dignity and hope for the future .
repeatedly , a fragile peace has broken down because of the lack of economic follow-up . despite grand promises of foreign aid , economic reconstruction , and development in Afghanistan , Iraq , Lebanon , and elsewhere , the actual record of international assistance to post-war reconstruction is gravely deficient .
pledges of billions of dollars are announced . a smiling new head of state graciously thanks the international community , including the occupying power .
but actual reconstruction and recovery is delayed , perhaps for years . crony businesses from the US and Europe , which are utterly unfamiliar with local conditions , squander time , aid funds , and opportunities .
many factors contribute to this disarray , beginning with the shocking inability of the US , Europe , and the international organizations to understand things from the perspective of poor and displaced people . their lack of empathy is deplorable , but there are conceptual problems as well .
in the second phase , at the war ’ s end , aid remains mainly humanitarian relief , but now directed towards displaced people returning home , and to decommissioned soldiers . in the third phase , lasting three to five years , aid supports the first phase of post-war economic development , including restoration of schools , clinics , farms , factories , and ports .
there is often a lag of years before moving from humanitarian relief to real economic development . by the time such help actually arrives , it is often too late : war has been re-ignited .
impoverished farmers should receive a free package of seeds , fertilizers , and low-cost equipment ( such as pumps for irrigation ) . when such aid is made available quickly , former soldiers will return to their farms , and can establish a livelihood by the beginning of the first growing season following the end of hostilities .
small rural clinics can be built or rebuilt very quickly , within the first year of peace . solar panels and wind turbines can provide off-grid power in isolated rural areas .
these and similar efforts can mean the difference between famine and food security , epidemic disease and health , income and utter poverty , and , most importantly , hope and despair . yet the window of opportunity closes quickly .
Quick-impact economic development is exactly what is needed now to help end the horrific violence and suffering in Darfur . sanctions , threats , and peacekeepers are only short-term measures , whereas real progress there against extreme poverty is not only achievable , but also is something that the government and rebels can agree on .
but the window of opportunity closes quickly in these and other post-conflict regions . only by taking quick , meaningful action to fight hunger , poverty , and disease can there be a chance of creating conditions for long-term peace .
winning the Transition
although Egypt and Tunisia ’ s pro-democracy movements achieved rapid regime change , uncertainties remain in those countries , too . after a brief period of hope , many observers now wonder whether the region is capable of producing viable , and economically vibrant , democracies .
bridging the vast gap between high expectations and the reality of limited budgets and capabilities is a test in itself . redressing past injustice and building an economy that offers opportunity to all are major challenges as well , fraught with volatility , uncertainty , and the dangers of political opportunism .
in the 1990 ’ s , I was among those Indonesians who demanded and celebrated the departure of our own autocrat , Suharto , and I joined the new government when he left . many observers predicted that Indonesia , the world ’ s most populous Muslim country , would be unable to sustain democracy and would ultimately decline into chaos .
perhaps most importantly , we learned that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for democratization . each of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa will face unique challenges , which will have to be addressed on their own terms .
change must be formally manifested , with new laws that are widely publicized . legislation that empowers citizens with freedom of expression , free and independent elections , and freedom of association is crucial , and it must be made clear to the public that no one is above the law .
transparency and accountability are powerful ideas with near-universal support , which means that new leaders should not give up when the fight becomes difficult . civil-society organizations , local communities , representatives of the poor and vulnerable , and women play a vital role in this regard , and they should be included at every level of decision-making .
in Indonesia , we signed a hundred laws in less than 18 months , covering everything from media freedom to elections , corruption , decentralization , and anti-trust rules . we ratified new public-finance legislation and ensured the independence of the country ’ s central bank .
in post-revolutionary times , expectations are high , and the obstacles to meeting them are enormous . I know from personal experience that we did not always have the luxury of getting the best outcomes .
nationalistic sentiment is strong , and politicians and interest groups can exploit it . often , the security forces are holdovers from the old regime , and there is no independent judicial system .
for example , we appointed an independent judge to take over the bankruptcy and corruption courts , because career judges were too tainted . likewise , when we started cash-for-work programs as part of our pro-poor agenda , we asked communities to run these initiatives .
it is important to restore economic activity and create a favorable environment for entrepreneurs , particularly small and medium-size businesses , which constitute the main engine of job creation . the recent revolutions , it should be recalled , started with the self-immolation of a Tunisian fruit vendor , who was harassed and insulted by the authorities .
but economic success without accountability and social inclusion is not sustainable , and new governments often must face tough choices in order to protect the poor and vulnerable . they might have to abolish mis-targeted subsidies to free up resources for more targeted and efficient anti-poverty and job-creation programs .
in Indonesia , we had to draw a line between the very poor and the near-poor . we could not afford to raise salaries or provide subsidies for everybody .
finally , countries in transition need support – not only money , but also technical know-how to implement highly complex reforms . when I became Indonesia ’ s finance minister , I had 64,000 employees .
yes , we needed external assistance , but we never surrendered “ ownership ” of the reform process ; we made it work for us . if we Indonesians had not been in charge of our own transition , it could easily have failed .
winning with Opium in Afghanistan
despite considerable effort by the international community in Afghanistan since 2001 to eliminate the Taliban and al Qaeda , the insurgency in the south of the country has gathered momentum at breakneck speed in recent months . our field research shows that we are not winning the campaign for the hearts and minds of the Afghan people – the Taliban are .
the aggressive United States-led counter-narcotics policy of crop eradication has failed to win the support of Afghans , because it has triggered a chain reaction of poverty and violence in which poor farmers , with their only livelihood destroyed , are unable to feed their families . this has been exacerbated by the failure to provide even the most basic aid and development in the country ’ s poorest areas .
at the same time , communities have been torn apart as a result of bombing campaigns , which have destroyed the very homes we came to protect . this , in addition to four years of drought , has forced entire families to leave their villages for makeshift internal refugee camps .
you do not win people over by bombing them , but by helping them .
the Taliban have exploited the failures of the international community in extremely effective anti-Western propaganda that has fueled significant doubt in the minds of the public concerning the reasons justifying the international presence in Afghanistan . sadly , our troops are often the first to pay the price – sometimes with their lives .
it is not too late to win back the hearts and minds of the Afghan people . international troops are excelling in an exceptionally hostile environment , but this is not a war that will be won by military means alone .
but a successful strategy – one that responds to Afghanistan ’ s extreme poverty crisis – requires that the international community reverse course on crop eradication . in fact , the eradication of poppy crops not only damage local communities and undermines the international community ’ s goals , but it is also failing : opium production last year was at an all-time high .
eradication will never be successful in Afghanistan , because it destroys the single crop that will grow in the south ’ s harsh climate – and thus serves as the main source of income to millions of people . so a new , long-term , economically sustainable solution is urgently needed – one that directly engages with the communities that are suffering most – in order to achieve the support of the deeply impoverished rural population .
not only would poppy licensing address the poverty and hunger crises that have engulfed the south of Afghanistan ; it also would stabilize existing local structures , giving communities a reason to support President Hamid Karzai ’ s government and the international community . farmers would gain a sense of ownership in counter-narcotics efforts , in sharp contrast to the current idealistic – and evidently un-achievable – policy of crop eradication .
we must have the backing of the Afghan people if we are to defeat the Taliban . by endorsing such an initiative , the international community would demonstrate that it is in Afghanistan for the good of the local population , which would help farmers sever ties with the insurgency .
according to the World Food Program , 70 % of the population lack food security . an immediate injection of emergency food and medical aid is urgently needed to break the vicious circle of suffering and violence .
only then could a new , long-term development strategy in Afghanistan – one that admits that the international community is not winning the war , and that the status quo is unacceptable – be implemented . licensing the opium crop would be a realistic and pragmatic cornerstone of that strategy ’ s success .
Wolfowitz and the World Bank at Bay
will World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz ’ s troubles finally catalyze real change at the World Bank ? will there finally be an end to the archaic practice by which the President of the United States unilaterally appoints the head of the world ’ s most important development agency ?
facing an extraordinary rebuke from the Bank ’ s ministerial oversight committee and open revolt from his professional staff , Wolfowitz has faint hope of limping through the last three years of his term . the immediate uproar is over the exceedingly generous pay and promotion package that Wolfowitz awarded in 2005 to his girlfriend as compensation for leaving the Bank to pave the way for his arrival .
instead , his claim to fame was his role as architect of America ’ s failed war in Iraq . by all accounts , Wolfowitz is brilliant , but it seems inconceivable that an open , transparent , and multilateral selection process would have chosen him to head the World Bank .
I have long advocated shifting the Bank ’ s center of gravity from lending to outright grants , a policy that the Bush administration strongly endorses . but choosing someone with no obvious background or experience in economic development was not the way to make progress on this front .
if Wolfowitz were otherwise overwhelmingly the most qualified candidate , the selection committee may have found a way to finesse the issue , openly and transparently . but , given his questionable fit for the job in the first place , the girlfriend issue might have been disqualifying .
it is a sorry tale of poor global governance . Europe does not get in America ’ s way because it wants to maintain Europe ’ s equally out-dated privilege of appointing the head of the International Monetary Fund , the Bank ’ s sister institution .
Asia has little choice but to defer to the US and Europe ’ s shenanigans because it is grossly under-represented in both organizations . as for Africa , its leaders are loath to do or say anything that might interrupt the flow of World Bank largesse .
many people , including myself , have long complained about the leadership selection process at the World Bank and the IMF . how can the Bank and the Fund continue to go around lecturing developing economies on good governance and transparency but fail to allow change in their own houses ?
to be fair , the IMF ’ s leadership is making a determined effort to give dynamic emerging economies , particularly in Asia , a bigger say in Fund governance . if carried far enough , this process would ultimately catalyze the necessary changes .
unfortunately , the IMF ’ s rebalancing efforts are proceeding at a glacial pace . at the World Bank , nothing seems to be happening at all .
perhaps when Gordon Brown becomes the UK ’ s next prime minister , he will be able to convince the G7 group of rich countries to lead the charge for change . as head of the Fund ’ s ministerial oversight committee , Brown understands the issues as well as anyone .
there are plenty of great potential non-American candidates . South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has ably served as head of the World Bank ’ s oversight committee and would make a brilliant World Bank president .
one way or the other , the Bank and the IMF leadership selection process urgently needs to be revamped . what the Wolfowitz debacle tells us most clearly is that the time for patience with the status quo is over .
women for Integration
Copenhagen – The past decade has proven again and again that empowering women worldwide holds the key to solving many seemingly intractable issues that have otherwise stymied policymakers . poverty in the developing world seemed ineradicable until micro-lenders saw millions of low-income , destitute women as potential entrepreneurs .
could the tensions and conflicts surrounding the issue of immigration in Europe be yet another issue for which the empowerment of women holds a solution ?
in a recent visit to Copenhagen to commemorate International Women ’ s Day , I took part in many conversations that duplicate others throughout Europe : citizens from across the political spectrum were struggling with the issue of non-European immigration and the cultural tensions that have ensued . what does it mean to be Danish , German , or French in the presence of these millions of newcomers , most of whom come from non-democratic societies ?
what would “ integration ” mean , and how is it achieved without the loss of cherished civil-society values ? these are not necessarily xenophobic questions : a post-enlightenment civil society , with a free press and due process , is a precious thing , and those values should not be sacrificed to politically correct moral relativism .
this issue has been given new urgency by the arrests in Ireland of alleged jihadists from several countries who are accused of plotting to murder a Swedish cartoonist who drew an image of the prophet Mohammed as a dog . across Europe , the discussions are growing more intense as anti-immigration platforms gain supporters in otherwise liberal countries , from Germany to France to traditionally inclusive and tolerant Denmark itself .
one of its many innovative programs is already showing results in terms of genuinely integrating immigrant families into Danish society . by addressing immigrant women – and by viewing them as potential leaders , rather than as quiescent potential maids or service workers – KVINFO is enabling their families to witness the benefits of an open civil society in their own lives .
by 2010 , it had 5,000 participants , had won awards and international acclaim for best integrative practices , and is being replicated throughout Denmark – and observers are exploring programs or partnerships modeled upon it in Canada , Spain , Portugal , and Norway . the program pairs refugee and immigrant women in a one-to-one mentoring relationship with women who are established leaders at all levels of Danish society .
a careful matchmaking process unites the interests and goals of the women on both sides , and already has paid amazing dividends . women who were journalists , engineers , or scientists in their countries of origin – and who could not get jobs as checkout cashiers in Denmark – have been paired with Danish counterparts and are now back in school , or working in research .
as they enter the workforce , their language skills improve , their household income soars , and their children see firsthand a woman in a respected , economically valued role . their loved ones thus learn how to thrive in a European context – occasionally coming to KVINFO events and benefiting from their mothers ’ expanding network of contacts .
I am often struck by the way many Europeans use arms-length euphemisms when talking about immigrants : they want immigrants to feel “ welcome ” or “ comfortable . ” I always wonder , “ But do you want them to feel French , or German , or Norwegian ? ”
to be fully integrated , Muslim and other newcomers to European countries must be welcomed not as perpetual visitors – even if , ideally , as nicely treated visitors – but rather as family members , as the American model does ( or aspires to do ) . as Møller Jensen put it , “ I want these children to feel Danish . ”
Arab Women ’ s Unfinished Revolution
FEZ – Though women across the Middle East participated actively in the Arab Spring protests that began in late 2010 , they remain second-class citizens , even where popular uprisings managed to topple autocratic regimes . indeed , the Islamist governments now in power in several countries seem more determined than the despots that they replaced to keep women out of politics .
they see economic disintegration all around them , raising the possibility of a further increase in violence . as social bonds fray , they feel increasingly vulnerable .
female representation in parliaments and government cabinets after the Arab Spring has been either absent or meager , and women activists worry that Islamist parties will implement reactionary policies that discriminate on the basis of gender . in Egypt , for example , the Freedom and Justice Party , which dominates the parliament , claims that a woman cannot become President .
in Morocco , while there were eightwomen in the previous cabinet , today there is only one in the Islamist-led government . in January , the Islamist-dominated parliament adopted a decree lowering the age of marriage for girls from 18 to 16 , a major setback .
women hold less than 1 % of seats in the current Egyptian parliament ; previously , they held 12 % . in Libya , a first draft of the electoral law reserved 10 % of seats in the constituent assembly for women , but the quota was later abandoned .
but 42 of these women are members of Ennahda , which regards Sharia ( Islamic law ) as the source of legislation . long-time Tunisian activists fear that Ennahda , which dominates the assembly , will use the presence of women MPs to restrict women ’ s rights .
the recent assassination of the secular Tunisian opposition leader Chokri Belaid has raised the stakes for women there . Belaid was a voice on behalf of women ’ s rights , and the threat of increased political violence will focus on those who advocate secular equality for all Tunisians , including women .
in Tunisia , the most Westernized of the Arab countries , women have been attacked at universities and schools , and are being forced to wear the hijab . a woman who was allegedly raped by two policemen in September 2012 was charged with public indecency when she filed a complaint .
across the Middle East , Islamist militias have harassed , arrested , raped , and tortured women pro-democracy activists . the model of Iran ’ s Islamic Revolution in 1979 , which imposed second-class citizenship on women , is frequently cited as a threat in Arab countries now ruled by Islamist parties .
women make up half of the Middle East ’ s population , and any hope of political and economic development must account for that fact . organizations like the United Nations Development Program have repeatedly issued reports demonstrating the connection between economic decline and oppression of women .
in her Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in 2011 , Yemeni political activist Tawakkol Karman , made the point clearly : “ The solution to women ’ s issues can only be achieved in a free and democratic society in which human energy is liberated , the energy of both women and men together . ”
Middle Eastern countries should protect and consolidate women ’ s rights as a way to reinforce democratic ideas and habits . they must institute the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international laws and agreements in order to eradicate gender-based discrimination and violence .
women on Top ?
indeed , in the United States and France , there are even alternative female candidates for the presidency ( Condoleezza Rice in America , Michelle Alliot-Marie in France ) . will this mean a new style of both domestic politics and international relations ?
all three were powerful prime ministers of their countries , though perhaps not the epitome of what might be regarded as feminine values . they all outdid men at their own game and had little time for what came to be called feminism .
indeed , another trend may be more significant as far as political leadership is concerned . when it comes to the formation of governments , women have managed to break out of the prison of their traditional domains , such as education and social affairs .
while opponents of globalization still fight “ neo-liberal ” policies , political discourse has taken a new turn . words like “ justice ” are back in fashion ; there is concern about globalization ’ s losers and the “ underclass . ”
Yuliya Tymoshenko was clearly the most stouthearted among the leaders of Ukraine ’ s Orange Revolution , and no one has ever described Hillary Clinton as particularly “ soft . ” On the contrary , her possible Republican opponent in 2009 , Senator John McCain , while a war hero , is also a man who represents to many Americans the new soft values .
Merkel had a difficult time in the run-up to her recent party conference , because Jürgen Rüttgers , the minister-president of the largest German state , North-Rhine Westphalia , reminded the Christian Democrats of their historical support for strong social-welfare policies . only Royal may be said to represent softer lines against the hard-liner of the governing party , Nicolas Sarkozy .
it took decades to become real , and there are still countries that have a long way to go . despite Tymoshenko ’ s leading role in Ukraine , it would be surprising to see Russian President Vladimir Putin replaced by a woman , and , while there is a female vice-president in China , there is no sign of a woman becoming Japanese prime minister soon .
not infrequently this has been helped by explicit policies . David Cameron prides himself on a successful campaign to make 40 % of all Conservative parliamentary candidates in Britain are women .
rather , it is a more general trend , helped along by open-minded leaders of both sexes , that has changed the political climate in countries . no one , man or woman , can today aspire to setting the tone of public discourse without recognizing that politics is no longer only a man ’ s game .
worker Protests In China : plentiful But Preempted
the last annualized figure for labor protests that Beijing was willing to announce publicly was 100,000 for the year 1999 . but a 2001 internal report from the Ministry of Public Security disclosed that the numbers &quot; began a rise like a violent wind &quot; from 1997 , the year of the Communist Party &apos;s Fifteenth Congress , which pressed for factory firings in the name of &quot; efficiency . &quot;
while the government is determined to keep news of all disturbances out of the media--or at least downplay their size and disruptiveness--it has been possible to collect information on nearly 200 separate events occurring between 1994 and 2004 , some from news sources in Hong Kong , some from the Western media , and a few from Chinese publications .
they all exhibit the same , unchanging pattern : the government , whether in Beijing or the localities , tolerates the low-decibel , smaller-scale , relatively non-disruptive marches and sit-ins by demonstrators bearing petitions and posters , especially if they appear to be spontaneous , un-organized , localized and leaderless .
the incidents loom substantially more dangerous to the political elite if they seem to have been mobilized by dissidents , are marked by some measure of violence , threaten to spread , or entail the obstruction of major transport trunklines . indeed , the episodes that make it into the media beyond the Mainland are usually such protests .
job losses in the range of 60 million have suddenly rendered nearly an eighth of the urban populace indigent . often without a dependable channel for airing their grievances , hordes of laid-off workers and retired folk have filled the avenues over the past decade or so .
doesn &apos;t the government mind if so much of its urban populace is sinking into poverty and becoming disaffected ? why is this stability-obsessed regime allowing so much instability ?
but there is also a compensatory effort that has absorbed much of the energy of the bureaucracies for labor and social security , and for civil affairs . for 2004 , the central government allocated some 78 billion yuan for laid-off workers and the poor , with localities also upping their outlays .
additionally , there have been attempts to create new posts , develop labor-intensive industries and small and medium sized firms , promote the private sector , and encourage service jobs , plus offering occupational training : the government allocated an additional 4.7 billion yuan expressly for job creation in 2004 . these policies mitigate the pain of job loss for their recipients .
as workers &apos; consciousness of their rights increases , they are gradually more and more apt to appeal grievances to the courts : from 1995 to 2001 , adjudicated labor disputes rose from 28,000 to 101,000 . offering workers legal redress has turned their attention temporarily from the streets to mediation and may well have reduced the number of street demonstrations .
other initiatives are a program of allowances , training and placement for the laid-off ; unemployment insurance ( which , unfortunately , depends on the economic health of the firm to which a worker was once attached ) ; and pension reform--having similar problems . there is also a scheme to supply a &quot; minimum livelihood guarantee &quot; to the desperately poor .
workers ’ Paradise ?
or will their growing strength serve to make globalization more sustainable by fostering great equality and fairness ? one way or the other , unions stand as a major wild card for the evolution of our economic system in 2008 and beyond .
unions ’ rising influence is evident in many recent events : German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s controversial deal to raise minimum wages for postal employees ; several American presidential candidates ’ open misgivings about trade and immigration ; and the Chinese leadership ’ s nascent concerns about labor standards .
along with their political clout , unions ’ intellectual respectability is also experiencing a renaissance . after decades of vilification by economists for raising unemployment and strangling growth , the union movement is now receiving backing from thought leaders such as Paul Krugman , who argues that stronger unions are needed to counter globalization ’ s worst excesses .
the sudden emergence of unions as a political force is particularly surprising in the United States , where private-sector union membership has fallen from 25 % in 1975 to 8 % today . from high-tech Google to mass retailer Wal-Mart , US companies have found ways to keep their shops union-free .
for a relatively poor country like China , real unions could help balance employers ’ power , bringing quality-of-life benefits that outweigh the growth costs . factory conditions in parts of China are all too reminiscent of the early twentieth-century , pre-union US .
but , for the US and rich countries in Europe , the argument that stronger unions would bring more benefits than costs is far more dubious . nowadays , most workers already have legal and statutory rights that cover the basic protections that unions originally fought for a century ago .
instead , union influence today all too often serves to promulgate inflexible work practices and flat salary structures that do not adequately reward work effort and skill . it is no surprise that the public sector , where productivity is low and fiscal constraints soft , typically has the greatest union concentration .
before the modern globalization era , unions could thrive by organizing on a national scale , giving them enormous bargaining power vis-à-vis both employers and consumers . now , after the explosive post-war expansion of global trade , most unions have seen their monopoly power eroded , if not shattered .
some of the issues that unions are promoting , such as human rights and environmental quality , are unassailable . when they try to connect these issues with trade , however , their motives become questionable .
a case in point is union lobbying against the US-Colombia free-trade agreement , ratification of which would greatly advance US-Latin American relations . legitimate questions about how the Colombian government conducted its epic civil war with drug-financed rebels do not trump broader issues .
unfortunately , this play is being re-enacted across a host of trade issues , including many involving China .
for rich countries , income redistribution is much better handled through taxes and benefits system , rather than by government edicts to strengthen unions . the rich today pay so little in taxes in many countries , that it would be a big improvement simply to move to a flat tax , with a very high exemption level so that lower-income families pay nothing .
for middle-income countries , it is a tougher call . but here , too , increasing workers ’ legal and statutory rights , while allowing most unions to fade away , seems like the right approach .
unfortunately , we are far more likely to see unions ’ growing political influence become a major destabilizing force in trade and growth , with highly uncertain consequences . when we see political leaders in many rich countries pander to unions by bashing each other on free trade and immigration , there is every reason to worry about trouble ahead .
the Evolution of Work
Cambridge – In mid-December , the United Nations will launch the latest of its annual landmark Human Development Reports . this year ’ s report focuses on the nature of work : how the way we earn a living is being transformed by economic globalization , new technologies , and innovations in social organization .
historically , doing lots of backbreaking work is how countries have become rich . and being rich is how some people get the chance to do more pleasant work .
thanks to the Industrial Revolution , new technologies in cotton textiles , iron and steel , and transportation delivered steadily rising levels of labor productivity for the first time in history . first in Britain in the mid-eighteenth century , and then in Western Europe and North America , men and women flocked from the countryside to towns to satisfy factories ’ growing demand for labor .
they worked long hours in stifling conditions , lived in overcrowded and unsanitary housing , and experienced little growth in earnings . some indicators , such as workers ’ average height , suggest that standards of living may have even declined for a while .
eventually , capitalism transformed itself and its gains began to be shared more widely . this was partly because wages naturally began to rise as the surplus of rural workers dried up .
employment conditions improved as state-mandated or negotiated arrangements led to reduced working hours , greater safety , and family , health , and other benefits . public investment in education and training made workers both more productive and freer to exercise choice .
as a result , labor ’ s share of the enterprise surplus rose . while factory jobs never became pleasant , blue-collar occupations now enabled a middle-class standard of living , with all its consumption possibilities and lifestyle opportunities .
labor productivity in manufacturing industries rose much faster than in the rest of the economy : the same or higher quantity of steel , cars , and electronics could be produced with far fewer workers . so the “ excess ” workers moved to service industries – education , health , finance , entertainment , and public administration , for example .
for those with the skills , capital , and savvy to prosper in the post-industrial age , services offered inordinate opportunities . bankers , consultants , and engineers earned much higher wages than their industrial-age forebears .
notwithstanding long hours ( perhaps longer than in factory jobs ) , service professionals enjoyed much greater control over their daily lives and workplace decisions . teachers , nurses , and waiters were not paid nearly as well , but they , too , were released from the humdrum mechanical drudgery of the shop floor .
for less skilled workers , however , service-sector jobs meant giving up the negotiated benefits of industrial capitalism . the transition to a service economy often went hand in hand with the decline of unions , employment protections , and norms of pay equity , greatly weakening workers ’ bargaining power and job security .
inequality , exclusion , and duality became more marked in countries where skills were poorly distributed and many services approximated the textbook “ ideal ” of spot markets . the United States , where many workers are forced to hold multiple jobs in order to make an adequate living , remains the canonical example of this model .
the vast majority of workers still live in low- and middle-income countries and have yet to go through these transformations . there are two reasons to believe that their future path will ( or need ) not unfold in quite the same way .
first , there is no reason that safe working conditions , freedom of association , and collective bargaining cannot be introduced at earlier stages of development than has occurred historically . just as political democracy need not wait for incomes to rise , strong labor standards need not lag behind economic development .
could premature de-industrialization be a blessing in disguise , enabling workers in the developing world to bypass the drudgery of manufacturing ?
a society in which most workers are self-proprietors – shopkeepers , independent professionals , or artists – and set their own terms of employment while making an adequate living is feasible only when economy-wide productivity is already very high . high-productivity services – such as IT or finance – require well-trained workers , not the unskilled kind that poor countries have in abundance .
at the same time , the traditional engine of economic development – industrialization – is likely to operate at much lower capacity . the resulting combination of high public expectations and low income-producing capacity will be a major challenge for developing economies everywhere .

the Return of Currency Wars
new YORK – The recent decision by the Bank of Japan to increase the scope of its quantitative easing is a signal that another round of currency wars may be under way . the BOJ ’ s effort to weaken the yen is a beggar-thy-neighbor approach that is inducing policy reactions throughout Asia and around the world .
central banks in China , South Korea , Taiwan , Singapore , and Thailand , fearful of losing competitiveness relative to Japan , are easing their own monetary policies – or will soon ease more . the European Central Bank and the central banks of Switzerland , Sweden , Norway , and a few Central European countries are likely to embrace quantitative easing or use other unconventional policies to prevent their currencies from appreciating .
all of this will lead to a strengthening of the US dollar , as growth in the United States is picking up and the Federal Reserve has signaled that it will begin raising interest rates next year . but , if global growth remains weak and the dollar becomes too strong , even the Fed may decide to raise interest rates later and more slowly to avoid excessive dollar appreciation .
the cause of the latest currency turmoil is clear : in an environment of private and public deleveraging from high debts , monetary policy has become the only available tool to boost demand and growth . fiscal austerity has exacerbated the impact of deleveraging by exerting a direct and indirect drag on growth .
in the eurozone , a sudden stop of capital flows to the periphery and the fiscal restraints imposed , with Germany ’ s backing , by the European Union , the International Monetary Fund , and the ECB have been a massive impediment to growth . in Japan , an excessively front-loaded consumption-tax increase killed the recovery achieved this year .
not surprisingly , their trade deficits have been shrinking . but most countries that were over-saving and under-spending have not saved less and spent more ; their current-account surpluses have been growing , aggravating the weakness of global demand and thus undermining growth .
as fiscal austerity and asymmetric adjustment have taken their toll on economic performance , monetary policy has borne the burden of supporting faltering growth via weaker currencies and higher net exports . but the resulting currency wars are partly a zero-sum game : if one currency is weaker , another currency must be stronger ; and if one country ’ s trade balance improves , another ’ s must worsen .
easing can boost growth by lifting asset prices ( equities and housing ) , reducing private and public borrowing costs , and limiting the risk of a fall in actual and expected inflation . given fiscal drag and private deleveraging , lack of sufficient monetary easing in recent years would have led to double and triple dip recession ( as occurred , for example , in the eurozone ) .
but the overall policy mix has been sub-optimal , with too much front-loaded fiscal consolidation and too much unconventional monetary policy ( which has become less effective over time ) . a better approach in advanced economies would have comprised less fiscal consolidation in the short run and more investment in productive infrastructure , combined with a more credible commitment to medium- and long-term fiscal adjustment – and less aggressive monetary easing .
you can lead a horse to liquidity , but you can ’ t make it drink . in a world where private aggregate demand is weak and unconventional monetary policy eventually becomes like pushing on a string , the case for slower fiscal consolidation and productive public infrastructure spending is compelling .
moreover , public investment works on both the demand and supply sides . it not only boosts aggregate demand directly ; it also expands potential output by increasing the stock of productivity-boosting capital .
the right policies – less fiscal austerity in the short run , more public investment spending , and less reliance on monetary easing – are the opposite of those that have been pursued by the world ’ s major economies . no wonder global growth keeps on disappointing .
Homesick Politics
Madrid – World order – or the lack thereof – is a hot topic these days . our fixation with the future of global structures and systems is evident everywhere – in the news and at conferences , on bestseller lists , even in popular television shows .
the world seems to be undergoing fundamental change : new actors are emerging on the world stage , previously sacrosanct rules of international behavior are being openly defied , and a new wave of technological progress is disrupting entire industries and economic sectors . in our quest for structure and predictability – a natural impulse in times of rapid change – we are desperate for hints about how the world , and our role in it , will develop .
it is of course vital in such situations that we identify the best , or at least the most feasible , way forward ; predictability provides a foundation for cost-benefit analysis and strategic thinking . the problem arises when our yearning for certainty overwhelms rational thinking , taking our ideas and actions in an unproductive – or even dangerous – direction .
the current trend toward rose-colored retrospection is a case in point . faced with political , economic , geostrategic , and social uncertainty , policymakers have increasingly succumbed to the allure of nostalgia , promising a return to what they portray as the familiar and complete rules and practices of the past .
in Russia , President Vladimir Putin has been operating according to a nineteenth-century worldview , in which great powers dominate their spheres of influence unchallenged . as he noted at last October ’ s meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club , “ The bear will not even bother to ask permission .
the Islamic State is attempting to return to an even more distant past . its adherents espouse a medieval ninth-century doctrine to justify their effort to reestablish the caliphate , in which “ the legality of all emirates , groups , states , and organizations becomes null ” and summary execution and slavery are mandatory .
throughout Europe , populist parties – from the right-wing United Kingdom Independence Party to the far-left Syriza in Greece – seek a return to the ostensibly simpler and happier times of national control and closed borders . in the US , a prominent strain of jurisprudence defends the “ original intent ” of the Constitution ’ s framers , while Republicans are shifting toward isolationism and Democrats are denouncing free-trade agreements .
looking backward gets us no closer to what we want ; on the contrary , it is a surefire way to miss the challenges – and miss out on the opportunities – that lie before us . trying to advance one ’ s interests based on the rules of the past is like trying to solve today ’ s crossword puzzle using yesterday ’ s clues .
let ’ s face it : the halcyon world to which many people are so eager to return – before , say , the European Union or the United Nations or even the nation-state – never really existed . as Marcel Proust noted : “ Remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were . ”
but the word – a combination of the Greek nostos ( homecoming ) and algos ( pain ) – was coined to describe the disease of “ acute homesickness . ” Perhaps it would be beneficial to return to that definition of nostalgia , at least in its political manifestation , as something more akin to an illness : a condition that distorts reality and impedes the formulation of effective solutions for real-world challenges .
no worldview rooted in the nineteenth century – much less in the ninth century – is adequate to the complexities of today ’ s globalized world . likewise , the rise of new powers and non-state actors means that rule making ( and breaking ) can no longer be restricted to a small Western club .
flimsy ideas thrive in the absence of a viable alternative . that is why a period of reflection on world order is so important .
managing a World of Great Powers
Madrid – Today , great-power competition is a fact : the United States now competes with an increasingly active Russia and a rising China . the Middle East , the South China Sea , and Ukraine are just three theaters where this new reality is playing out .
upon rereading former US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott ’ s book The Great Experiment , I was left with the impression that the seeds of some of the dynamics at play today were sown some time ago . the book describes a conversation that took place in December 2000 between President Bill Clinton and President-elect George W. Bush .
these issues were put on hold when tragedy unexpectedly struck , in the form of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the US , which brought a period of international cooperation during which solidarity against terrorism reigned . it was a time when we were all Americans , and when Bush described Putin as “ very straightforward and trustworthy . ”
the winds began to change that December , when the US announced that it was withdrawing from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty , in order to build an antimissile defense system to protect itself from a potentially nuclearized Iran . this did not go unnoticed in Russia .
Russia ’ s military actions in Georgia – in the midst of the Games – showed the world that the concept of spheres of influence was still alive and well in the Kremlin . and the collapse the following month of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers , which unleashed a global financial crisis from which the world economy has yet to recover fully , underscored the advanced economies ’ vulnerabilities , while largely sparing China .
with a new sense of confidence in its great-power status , China seemed to qualify the concept of a “ peaceful rise ” that its leaders have invoked since the era of Deng Xiaoping , adopting a more muscular foreign-policy approach within its neighborhood . drawing on alleged historical rights , China began to expand its territorial claims , along with its military presence , in the South and East China Seas .
many of the countries affected by China ’ s actions in the South and East China Seas have security treaties with the US , which has been the major maritime power in the Pacific region since World War II . China ’ s ADIZ declaration was therefore viewed by the US as a provocation .
it has taken the international institutions some time to catch up to the changing world order . the 2010 G-20 summit in Seoul produced an agreement to increase the emerging countries ’ quotas in the International Monetary Fund by 2014 .
fragmentation of the international institutions seemed imminent – that is , until European countries decided to join the AIIB . though the US resisted at first , and has still refused to join , that decision was lent some nuance in a later conversation between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama .
by violating the Helsinki Final Act in the spring of 2014 , Putin placed Russian foreign policy in direct opposition to that of the US and Europe . this position was reaffirmed in September , when Putin decided to intervene in the Syrian conflict , securing for Russia a role in any attempt to bring peace to the country .
today , the world is very different from what some might have imagined at the end of the last century , a decade after the Berlin Wall came down . historically speaking , 15 years can seem long or short , depending on the intensity of change .
but confrontation is not the whole story . promising steps have been made in two critical areas : nuclear non-proliferation , especially through the nuclear deal with Iran , and the fight against climate change , exemplified in the encouraging preparations for the current climate summit in Paris .
if there is one lesson to be learned from all of this , it is that well-executed , tenacious diplomacy still holds extraordinary power to resolve conflicts . it remains the best instrument to produce those cooperative outcomes that confrontation effectively impedes .
worlds Apart
as surveyed in the United Nations report The Inequality Predicament , few countries , rich or poor , have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality , or to its consequences for education , health , and social welfare .
but inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to resentment and social instability , threatening security . excluded and facing bleak life prospects , young people , in particular , often experience anomie and may turn to anti-social behavior , including violence .
clearly , however , poverty arises from various complex conditions , and its amelioration requires a multidimensional approach . it is hard to imagine , for example , how to “ make poverty history ” without also generating enough decent work , educational opportunities , and healthcare for all .
access to education for girls has improved , and some gender gaps have been reduced . despite AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis , life expectancy has increased in much of the world due to improved public health systems .
the most important determinant of income inequality today is wealth inequality , with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years principally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries . meanwhile , growing unemployment , widening skill and productivity gaps , and the “ informalization ” or “ casualization ” of labor markets have exacerbated income inequalities worldwide , as the number of “ working poor ” and the incidence of “ jobless growth ” has spread .
nor have stabilization and structural adjustment programs , imposed since the 1980 ’ s , delivered on their promise of achieving higher economic growth . growth in much of the world during the past quarter-century has been slower than in the previous 25 years , despite more rapid growth in East Asia , India , and a few other countries .
but inequalities at the national level have deepened in most countries in recent years , largely due to economic liberalization at both the national and international levels . indeed , in much of the world , such economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the progressive role of government , while otherwise increasing overall inequalities .
the few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions . but they are exceptions : the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has been greater inequality in most developed and developing countries , with rising unemployment , greater earnings disparities , reduced social protection , and environmental degradation .
international financial liberalization , for example , has undermined the use of more inclusive and targeted developmental credit to promote desired economic activities . in addition , contrary to the promises of its proponents , financial liberalization has actually resulted in net capital flows from the capital-poor to the capital-rich over the long term , while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity .
meanwhile , free-trade negotiations seem to ignore historical trends . developing countries ’ international terms of trade have worsened : prices of primary commodities have declined in relation to manufactures , as have tropical agriculture prices against temperate agriculture , and prices of generic manufactures have fallen relative to output protected by intellectual property rights .
as a result , trade liberalization of manufactures has resulted in de-industrialization and greater unemployment in much of the world , as in the case of garments this year . and , while agricultural trade liberalization may enhance export earnings for some poor countries , the main beneficiaries will be the more well-to-do agricultural exporters .
the “ retreat of the state ” in much of the developing world in recent decades has involved a generally reduced role for government , including the capacity to lead and sustain development , as well as its progressive social interventions in areas such as public education , health , housing , and utilities .
the economic liberalization carried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a flawed policy from the start , and its consequences have become glaringly obvious . unless the world refocuses economic policies to address the adverse impact of economic inequality on growth and poverty reduction , the poor and the privileged will continue to live worlds apart .
Putin on Parade
new YORK – This May ’ s parade in Moscow to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II promises to be the greatest Victory Day celebration since the Soviet Union ’ s collapse . some 16,000 soldiers , 200 armored vehicles , and 150 planes and helicopters are set to pass through and over Red Square .
yet , though Russia ’ s WWII allies were from Europe and North America , no Western leaders will attend the commemoration – a reflection of the West ’ s disapproval of Putin ’ s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea . instead , Russian President Vladimir Putin ’ s high-profile guests will include the leaders of China , India , and North Korea , underscoring just how few friends Russia has these days .
indeed , watching Russia nowadays is like watching the last installment of the X-Men film franchise , “ Days of Future Past . ” Just as the X-Men in that film join forces with their younger selves to save mankind ’ s future , today ’ s Kremlin is harking back to Russia ’ s Soviet past in what it sees as a contemporary fight for the country ’ s survival .
critical to this strategy is propaganda conflating the West today with the Germans who invaded Russia in 1941 , while painting Ukrainian government officials as “ fascists ” and “ neo-Nazis . ” The Kremlin has relied on such claims , together with the supposed need to defend Russians abroad , to justify its aggression against Ukraine .
a month later , Putin reinforced this image of Russians as the morally superior victims of a cruel and uncompromising West . “ We are less pragmatic than other people , less calculating , ” he asserted , before adding that Russia ’ s “ greatness ” and “ vast size ” means “ we have a more generous heart . ”
at the time , the military parade in Red Square – featuring almost 35,000 troops , up to 1,900 pieces of military equipment , and a 1,400-man orchestra – was a well-deserved pageant . the Soviet leadership spared no cost in staging its military displays , which , in the absence of an external military threat , became an important vehicle for rallying national unity .
after the Soviet Union ’ s collapse , Russia , no longer a superpower , put its military spectacles on ice . but in 2005 , to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII , Putin held a major parade – one that Western leaders , believing that Russia might have a European future , did attend .
how can one celebrate the end of a war at a time when the descendants of those who fought it ( undoubtedly driven by the hope that future generations would live in peace ) are killing one another in a brutal little war in eastern Ukraine ? what is the point of grandiose fireworks displays amid the firing of real howitzers and rockets ?
Putin views himself as a new czar . his KGB background dictates his leadership style , which includes the abolition of free and fair elections , the persecution of opponents , and the promotion of conservative values that he , like Pétain before him , juxtaposes with the corrupting influence of an “ immoral ” and “ decadent ” West .
relying on this approach , Putin has built alliances with the likes of Syria ’ s President Bashar al-Assad and Egypt ’ s military ruler Abdel Fattah el-Sisi . China , the world ’ s second largest economy , is a useful addition to this collection of friendly anti-democratic states , as it has its own strategic grievances with the West .
Putin may try to portray his actions in Ukraine as a fight against fascism . but it is really a fight for relevance – a fight he will never win .
China ’ s Dream World
in functioning democracies , government leaders can be held accountable for their promises : the press can scrutinize their policies , opposition parties are motivated to show that the party in power lies and cheats . as a result , incumbents are frequently forced to carry out at least some of their promises .
press censorship , repression of dissent , and the absence of organized opposition allow rulers the luxury of promising whatever they want , with no political consequences for failing to deliver . the result is government of the sloganeers , by the sloganeers , and for the sloganeers .
China appears to have perfected this form of government over the last decade . the ruling Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) , in response to rising public demand for social justice , has devised numerous slogans , such as “ governing for the people , ” “ building a harmonious society , ” “ balanced development , ” “ scientific development , ” and so on .
whenever the top leadership in Beijing uttered such slogans , they became the rallying cry of the bureaucracy . the party ’ s massive propaganda machine went into overdrive and blanketed the country with a publicity blitz that would make the most extravagant Madison Avenue advertising campaign look like child ’ s play .
in the last decade , GDP growth soared , but most indices of social justice , governance performance , and public welfare deteriorated . macroeconomic imbalances worsened as economic growth became excessively dependent on investment and exports .
without missing a beat , Xi , like his predecessors , rolled out a new slogan to inspire popular confidence in his leadership . as a catchphrase for his administration ’ s objective , “ the great renaissance of the Chinese nation ” is bit long , but it has lately morphed into the simpler “ China Dream . ”
the substance of the China Dream remains difficult to determine . when Xi first unveiled his slogan after being selected as the CCP ’ s new general secretary , he defined it in simple , accessible , but nonetheless generic terms : the “ Chinese people dream of living the same good life as all other people in the world . ”
China ’ s ever-zealous propaganda officials , evidently fearful of not demonstrating sufficient loyalty and respect for the new party chief , quickly hijacked the slogan ; the China Dream has replaced the “ China Model ” in official political branding . whatever the new administration does is touted as part of its ambitious effort to make the “ China Dream ” come true .
unfortunately , China propagandists , who double as censors , have a perverse ability to discredit anything that they try to brand . the China Dream is no exception .
he has risen to the top by winning friends and allies inside the CCP . now that he is the leader of a dynamic , diverse , and increasingly demanding society , he must gain popular support and confidence to maintain his credibility and become an effective politician .
the first thing that Xi should do is to articulate a clearer , more specific , and inspiring version of the China Dream , and stop letting the CCP ’ s propaganda officials define it for him . the China Dream may include all of the economic benefits and material comfort that ordinary Chinese desire , but it will not be complete without the human rights and dignity that citizens in civilized societies take for granted .
the second thing that Xi and his colleagues need to do is to follow up with specific policies and actions that can bolster the credibility of their declared goals . political slogans , however high-sounding , become stale when their purveyors fail to make good on their promises .
Xi may still be enjoying a honeymoon with the Chinese public , but it is likely to be a short one . his predecessors had ten years to carry out real reforms and accomplished little , leaving the Chinese in no mood to endure another decade of government by shibboleth .
when Xi Meets Obama
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA – As Chinese President Xi Jinping begins his trip to the United States in Seattle , home to many of the world ’ s leading technology firms , most observers are looking ahead to his subsequent meeting with President Barack Obama . can the summit reverse the downward spiral in US-China relations that began with Xi ’ s accession to power in 2013 ?
from the US perspective , China ’ s reckless behavior in the South China Sea , unrestrained cyber attacks against American targets , protectionist economic policies , and escalating political repression at home have demolished the belief that a globally integrated China would be a responsible and cooperative partner . indeed , recent Chinese actions directly challenge vital American interests and core values .
Chinese leaders , for their part , view America ’ s strategic “ pivot to Asia ” as a thinly veiled step to tighten its geopolitical containment of China . moreover , they have become obsessed with US dominance in international finance and technology and , most important , America ’ s ideological commitment to liberal democracy , which they regard as an existential threat to the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) .
the toxic mix of mutual mistrust and tit-for-tat behavior has brought Sino-American ties to their lowest point since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 . there is now widespread concern that the US and China may be headed for a new cold war .
to maintain his domestic image as a strong leader , he must stick to his nationalist rhetoric and policies . but he also needs to stabilize the all-important relationship with the US .
judging by recent moves by China and the US , we can expect modest success in a few contentious areas . while such improvements , on their own , will not change the relationship ’ s adversarial dynamic , they may halt the deterioration in bilateral ties , at least for now .
the US extradited a low-level Chinese official to face corruption charges . the Obama administration also decided not to announce sanctions against Chinese entities and individuals allegedly involved in cyber attacks on American companies and government agencies .
in fact , the two sides are reportedly negotiating a landmark deal that would prohibit cyber attacks against each other ’ s vital infrastructure . an agreement on the issue could be the most important outcome of the summit , although other types of cyber attacks are unlikely to be covered by it .
for China , the biggest prize is a bilateral investment treaty ( BIT ) . in practical terms , a US-China BIT would make it easier for Chinese entities to invest and operate in the US and increase American firms ’ access to Chinese markets .
the US Congress is deeply skeptical , and the American business community needs convincing as well . both have been bitterly disappointed by China ’ s mercantilist trading policies after its accession to the World Trade Organization .
China has staked its national prestige and its leadership ’ s nationalist credentials on this issue , which means that Xi is likely to rebuff US demands that China cease all activities seen as militarizing its new artificial islands in disputed waters . the most that can be realistically expected is an insipid statement of the two sides ’ agreement to disagree .
but the most politically sensitive topic for China has little to do with cyber security or the South China Sea . it is China ’ s ongoing crackdown on civil liberties and human rights .
facing enormous domestic pressure , Obama has announced that human rights will be on the agenda of his summit with Xi . but Xi is unlikely to make any concessions , because doing so could damage his political standing within the CCP and undermine a central component of his political vision : the reassertion of political control over a dynamic society .
to be sure , trying is better than doing nothing . but what really matters is whether , after the summit , China takes concrete actions that reflect a genuine shift from the policies that have fueled the deterioration in bilateral ties .
why Work at Work ?
that may not be so surprising : she is a woman , and she allegedly has a nursery for her baby next door to her office . above all , people seemed to react to the categorical nature of her decision ( why everyone ? ) and to the irony that Yahoo ! is a tech company ( don ’ t they know about Skype ? ) .
but , until now , the “ right ” to work at home was sacrosanct at Yahoo ! , something that an employee ’ s manager could not overrule . and , by all accounts , enough people at Yahoo ! were not working , either from home or from more interesting places , that it had become a serious problem .
to be sure , it seems contradictory to some people that Yahoo ! , an online business , requires its employees to be physically present in the company ’ s offices . but most of the money and talent in this industry already seem to concentrate physically in one small part of the United States , between San Francisco and San Jose .
being physically present at work means direct contact with other sharp and creative minds . and the benefits of human contact and interaction are why salespeople still call on customers instead of using Skype , and why Meetup ( which supports organizers of face-to-face meetings ;
so , yes , online work can make a lot of sense in many situations , but when you are trying to fix a broken corporate culture , you need the commitment , human engagement , and creative interaction that happen most consistently in a physical workplace . in the end , it is up to good managers to decide who can work where , and to make meetings short and useful .
indeed , the whole point of having managers is that they are supposed to exercise judgment . otherwise , computers and the Internet would allow us not just to work from home , but to report to a software program rather than to a person .
as an independent angel investor with no real day job , I don ’ t have an office to report to every day . but I would miss the companionship of people working around me – even if they do not necessarily work with me .
I travel a lot , but I work from a desk at Meetup whenever I am at “ home ” in New York City . true , I don ’ t have to go to the company ’ s meetings , but I like being surrounded by busy people ;
Yankee Bases Go Home
Unasur or UNASUL ( depending on whether one speaks Spanish or Portuguese ) was established by the twelve presidents in Brasília in May 2008 with the aim of furthering economic and political integration . instead , Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez hijacked the Quito meeting to propagate his Bolivarian Revolution and expound his own ideas for the continent ’ s future as independent of the United States .
to no one ’ s surprise , Chávez dominated the criticism of the pact . he claimed that the “ Winds of war are blowing , ” and that the announcement of the military agreement “ can transform itself into a tragedy . ”
unfortunately , Colombian President Álvaro Uribe was absent from the meeting . Colombia and Ecuador broke diplomatic relations in March 2008 , after Colombia ’ s army pursued FARC guerillas , who have been fighting Colombia ’ s government for decades , into Ecuadorean territory .
in a continent where anti-Americanism remains both very popular and an effective way to consolidate national cohesion and political power , Chávez ’ s attacks found a ready audience . in addition , Uribe ’ s absence allowed Chávez to avoid responding to Colombia ’ s accusations that Venezuela and its ally Ecuador support the narco-Marxist FARC .
one week after the summit , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to calm the continent ’ s fears about the US-Colombia agreement , explaining that it is merely a minor revision of the Bill Clinton-era Plan Colombia , an American program to support the government against the drug cartels . but her words did little soothing .
nor did it seem to help that even most local military analysts say that the agreement does not represent any major change in the US military position on the continent . the simple fact is that the timing of the announcement of the pact was terrible , and gave a platform for Bolivarian rants that will not be without consequences .
recently , Brazil had been differentiating itself from the rest of the continent through its stable economy and vibrant democratic political system , both of which were helping the country ’ s poor . so the spread and strengthening of Chávez ’ s so-called Bolivarian Revolution was not in Brazil ’ s interests , even though some of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ’ s officials appear to be fans of Chávez and his administration .
the terrible timing of the US-Colombia military agreement also gave Chávez and his allies a reason to build up their armies against the “ evil imperialist ianque . ” After all , one must remember , the Bolivarian Revolution ’ s supposed “ enemy ” is the US , and no one else .
another unexpected consequence of the US-Colombia military agreement may be a further heightening of tensions between Venezuela and Colombia . the radical polarization of the Andean region between those two countries will create difficulties in building regional consensus and security problems in the Amazon , as well as weakening the Brazilian project for South American political and economic integration .
finally , another major consequence of the US-Colombia deal are the doubts that it has created in Latin America about President Barack Obama ’ s administration , and about the future of relations between the US and South America , especially Brazil , the main regional power . the agreement revived the perception that US diplomacy lacks sensitivity where the region is concerned .
if Obama wants to encourage moderate and democratic politics in South America , and to bolster Brazil ’ s efforts to foster stability and economic progress against the region ’ s radical and undemocratic forces , it must take greater care in not appearing to undermine those the US claims to support . for Chávez is showing that the old cry of “ Yankee go home ” still resonates .
China ’ s Singapore Swing
Beijing – The Chinese Communist Party has released the final document of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee . in the CCP ’ s history , the third plenum has traditionally been the occasion for the party to announce its major policies for the next 5-10 years .
small cities and towns will allow migrants to apply for the local hukou with no strings attached , and medium-size cities will do the same , with some restrictions . although large cities will remain as closed as ever , the new policy will dramatically weaken the institutional foundation of China ’ s long history of urban-rural and regional divides .
the new policy recommends that provinces allow couples to have two children if either parent is a single child . while this will affect only around 10 million couples – a small number in a country of more than 1.3 billion people – the reform represents a gigantic step toward ending the one-child rule .
farmers , moreover , will be granted the right to sell their residential land on the open market and will be much more likely to be compensated at market rates when their land is taken by the government . state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , meanwhile , are expected to surrender more of their profits to the government – up to 30 % by 2020 .
indeed , from now on , the central government will take over social-security expenditure , establishing nationally unified pension and health-insurance systems , while the retirement age will be raised gradually . currently , women can retire at the age of 50 , and men at 55 – ridiculously low by global standards and clearly unsustainable , given China ’ s rapidly aging population .
SOEs ’ power will be curtailed in other ways . their ability to stifle innovation will be weakened by a drastic reduction in the government ’ s power to restrict the entry of new competitors into all areas of the economy , as well as a major effort to reduce bureaucratic red tape .
financial liberalization , too , will be deepened , which will help startups and private firms most of all . in addition to pledging to liberalize exchange and interest rates , the final document also calls for allowing domestic private capital to form small and medium-size banks .
and , in an effort to bring coherence to commercial courts ’ rulings , the court system will be directly financed by the central government , rather than by the corresponding local government . this promises to strengthen the independence of the court system at the local level .
but the third plenum also provided surprises , including the creation of a leading group within the CCP to steer reform . China used to have a reform commission within the executive branch ; the establishment of the leading group indicates the CCP ’ s commitment , and that of President Xi Jinping , to comprehensive reform .
in the past , government direction was emphasized , despite an acknowledgement of the market ’ s positive role . now , for the first time , the CCP is officially calling for “ allowing the market to take a central role in resource allocation . ”
a final surprise is that the document sets a timeframe to complete all of the reforms ; by 2020 , China is supposed to become a full-fledged market economy . this is the first time in recent history that the CCP has set a specific deadline for policymaking .
for example , there was no clear mention of further SOE reform . likewise , though the document calls for strengthening local legislatures , it proposes no concrete plan to curb local governments ’ role in economic activities , which is one of the sources of distortions in the Chinese economy .
this is related to the final document ’ s most significant lacuna : political reform . in fact , a Singapore-style approach – combining a freewheeling market economy and an authoritarian regime – has clearly emerged from the plenum .
Singapore is a city-state of five million people – roughly the population of the Haidian district of Beijing . given China ’ s much greater size and complexity , the Chinese government ’ s pursuit of the Singaporean model , with its suppression of any and all social disorder , would ultimately undermine economic dynamism .
to build the innovative economy envisioned by the third plenum , the CCP ’ s leadership needs to find a new governance model that fosters a vibrant society . sooner rather than later , the crucially important economic reforms that have just been unveiled will not be enough .
China ’ s Real-Estate Wrongs
Beijing – China ’ s real-estate sector has been a source of serious concern for several years , with soaring property prices raising fears of overheating in the housing market . but , with price growth easing , it seems that the government ’ s campaign to rein in property risk is finally taking hold .
this flawed approach allowed China ’ s housing prices to continue to rise steadily , fueling major housing bubbles , especially in first-tier cities . the average Beijing resident would have to save all of his or her income for 34 years before to be able to purchase an apartment outright .
the expectation that this trend will continue has driven homeowners to retain possession of their properties , even though rental rates amount to less than 2 % of a property ’ s market value . but , with the real-estate sector finally facing a downturn , the time to rethink this investment strategy has arrived .
in the first four months of 2014 , housing sales dropped by nearly 7 % year on year , with construction of new floor area falling by more than 22 % . as a result , downward pressure on property prices is mounting .
but , at a time of weakening economic performance , China cannot afford an implosion of the real-estate sector , which accounts for at least 30 % of overall growth . indeed , though China ’ s government has expressed its willingness to sacrifice some growth in its pursuit of structural reform and rebalancing , the impact of a housing-market collapse on the financial sector would cause growth to slow beyond the acceptable limit .
instead of taking a direct approach – lifting the interest-rate cap imposed on banks – liberalization has been achieved by allowing shadow banking to flourish . as a result , a large number of nonbank financial institutions – such as wealth-management companies and online financial-services providers – are now using promises of high returns to attract small investors .
many remain convinced that China ’ s government – which wields with the world ’ s largest foreign-exchange reserves and virtually unchecked authority – would be able to prevent a major financial crisis . but the financial crisis in the fast-growing city of Wenzhou , triggered by bad loans , suggests otherwise – not least because the economy has yet to recover fully .
to avoid such an outcome , China ’ s leaders must urgently adopt counter-cyclical measures . they should begin by eliminating non-market-based restrictions on the real-estate sector , which have generated serious distortions not only to the economy , but also to people ’ s lives , with couples divorcing temporarily to gain the right to purchase an additional apartment .
when it comes to the real-estate sector , China ’ s government has consistently had the right objective and the wrong strategy . it is time to align intention with action .
in Praise of China ’ s New Normal
Beijing – China ’ s economy is , at long last , undergoing a rebalancing , with growth rates having declined from more than 10 % before 2008 to roughly 7.5 % today . is this China ’ s “ new normal , ” or should the country anticipate even slower growth in the coming decade ?
China ’ s rebalancing is apparent , first and foremost , in the export sector . export growth has slowed from its 2001-2008 average of 29 % annually to below 10 % , making foreign demand a far less critical engine of growth .
in fact , in the first half of this year , services accounted for more than half of total economic growth . it is no surprise , then , that China ’ s current-account surplus has shrunk rapidly , from its 2007 peak of more than 10 % of GDP to about 2 % of GDP today .
this rebalancing has helped to improve China ’ s income distribution . indeed , in recent years , labor ’ s share of national income has been on the rise – a direct reflection of the decline in manufacturing and expansion in services .
the first is the decline in global demand in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis , which has forced China to adjust its growth model sooner than anticipated . the second is China ’ s ongoing demographic transformation .
at the same time , China is undergoing rapid urbanization , with some 200 million people having left the agricultural sector in 2001-2008 to seek urban manufacturing jobs . more recently , however , the pace of migration has slowed substantially , with rural areas retaining 35 % of China ’ s total labor force .
for starters , it is likely that the contribution to output growth of the rising ratio of working-age people prior to 2010 was overestimated . that makes the subsequent decline in the ratio an inaccurate measure with which to determine the negative impact on economic performance .
moreover , this approach neglects the educational dividends that China will enjoy over the next 20 years , as the younger generation replaces older workers . as it stands , the rate of return-adjusted educational attainment for Chinese aged 50-60 is half that of those aged 20-25 .
by 2020 , the share of those aged 18-22 who are pursuing a college education will reach 40 % , compared to 32 % today . this improvement in human capital is bound to offset , to some extent , the net loss of labor .
furthermore , China ’ s low retirement age – 50 for women and 60 for men – provides policymakers with considerable room to maneuver . increasing the retirement age by just a half-year for each of the next ten years would more than compensate for the annual decline in the labor force , which is projected to be 2.5 million workers during this period .
though investment is likely to decline as a share of GDP , it will probably take a decade for it to dip below 40 % – still robust by international standards . meanwhile , the capital stock can maintain a reasonable growth rate .
finally , China ’ s capacity for innovation is improving steadily , owing to rapidly increasing human capital and rising investment in research and development . by next year , Chinese R &amp; amp ; D expenditure , at 2.2 % of GDP , will be closing in on advanced-country levels .
based on these trends – and assuming a constant labor-participation rate – China ’ s potential growth rate over the next decade is likely to hover around 6.9-7.6 % , averaging 7.27 % . this may be much lower than the 9.4 % average growth rate in 1988-2013 , but it is more than adequate by global standards .
China ’ s Shadow Menace
Beijing – The US Federal Reserve ’ s decision to exit from so-called “ quantitative easing ” – its massive monthly purchases of long-term assets – is stoking fears of a hard economic landing in China . but China ’ s strong economic fundamentals mean that policymakers have the space to avoid such an outcome – as long as they bring the country ’ s shadow banking system under control .
as it stands , Chinese consumption and investment growth is expected to remain at roughly last year ’ s levels . meanwhile , economic recovery in the advanced economies , especially the United States and Europe , is reinvigorating external demand , leading analysts to project annual Chinese export growth of more than 10 % this year – 3-4 percentage points higher than in 2013 .
worse , restricting commercial banks ’ role as financial intermediaries and encouraging the growth of unregulated shadow banking has generated even more risks for China ’ s economy . clearly , a new approach is needed – one that is based on a deeper understanding of the dangers inherent in China ’ s banking system .
with small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) – by far the economy ’ s most important growth engine – unable to acquire sufficient funding from the formal financial sector , they have been forced to turn to informal channels . as shadow banking has become the primary source of finance for SMEs – which tend to be higher-risk borrowers – the financial risks in China ’ s economy have grown exponentially .
exacerbating matters , the central bank ’ s repeated efforts to tighten the money supply raises the cost of capital . last June , the annualized interbank lending rate surged to more than 10 % – a level that it almost matched in December .
in just a few months , it received ¥ 400 billion from 85 million small investors . Tencent , China ’ s largest Internet company , is now using the same strategy to compete with Alibaba , with both companies offering high rates of return – often 6-7 % annually – to attract as many investors as possible .
the problem is that most of this investment is in the interbank market , meaning that SMEs ultimately face interest rates of more than 10 % – and that does not include the added 3 % for SMEs ’ loan guarantees . these unsustainable high rates are transmitting major risks to the real economy .
Liquidity-thirsty developers , unable to acquire financing through the formal banking sector , have been taking out massive loans at extremely high interest rates . but , in many cases , housing demand has not grown as expected , raising the risk of default – the effects of which would be transmitted to the entire financial sector .
the fact is that China has never been closer to a major financial crisis than it is today . yet China ’ s monetary authorities do not seem to understand the scale of the risk – or its root causes .
the Chinese economy may well need to be deleveraged . but , instead of blindly tightening the credit supply , policymakers must pursue deep financial-sector reform to liberalize the deposit rate , eliminate quantitative controls , and , most important , allow for the establishment of domestic private financial institutions .
pursuing this agenda is essential to China ’ s long-term financial and economic health . but doing so presupposes a major shift in Chinese monetary authorities ’ mindset .
did US Drone Strikes Lose Yemen ?
new YORK – Recent revelations that the US killed an innocent American in a drone strike in Pakistan confirm what a new study , “ Death by Drone , ” of civilian harm caused by US drone strikes in Yemen shows – that claims about the precision of drone strikes are overstated . the revelations also underscore the stark asymmetry between how the US treats drone strikes that kill its own citizens and those that kill others .
in Yemen , the US has been conducting drone strikes since at least 2002 , with estimates of the total number of strikes ranging from 91 to 203 . while the American and Yemeni governments have lauded the drones ’ precise targeting , they have refused to meaningfully disclose key details about the strikes , including how many have been conducted , who has been targeted , or , crucially , the number and identities of civilians killed .
“ Death by Drone , ” which includes first-hand testimony from eyewitnesses and survivors of drone strikes in Yemen , tells a different story . the nine case studies documented in the report , four of which cover attacks that came after the 2013 speech , provide credible evidence that US drone strikes have killed and injured Yemeni civilians , suggesting that the “ near-certainty ” standard is not being effectively implemented .
the report also casts doubt on Obama ’ s other claims , with evidence indicating that targets of drone strikes , though perhaps posing a threat to Yemen , may not have posed a direct threat to the US , and that their capture may have been possible . in other words , Yemeni civilians have suffered and died from drone strikes that may not have been necessary .
more generally , the report provides a window into the experiences of Yemeni civilians directly affected by US drone strikes . the testimonies of these individuals , vital for assessing the US drone program , are all too easy to overlook because these individuals are poor and have no political influence , and because the strikes are conducted in secret , far away from the US .
as Yaslem Saeed bin Ishaq , whose son was killed in a US drone strike in Wadi Sir on August 1 , 2013 , observed , “ They just kill . they do not know what havoc their missiles have caused .
the US ’ refusal to acknowledge drone strikes that kill foreigners is sending a damaging message in Yemen and beyond . as Moqbel Abdullah Ali al-Jarraah , a villager from Silat al-Jarraah , put it : “ I believe that America is testing its lethal inventions in our poor villages , because &#91; it &#93; cannot afford to do so at any place where human life has value .
in every incident recorded in this report , the families of Yemeni civilians killed in US strikes want to know why they were targeted . as the father of Nasser Mohammed Nasser , one of four innocent civilians killed in a US drone strike on April 19 , 2014 , lamented : “ My son and those who were with him had nothing to do with Al Qaeda .
but the US has given Nasser no answers . it has not even acknowledged that it killed his son .
in February 2013 , then-White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan testified at his Senate confirmation hearing to become CIA Director that , “ in the interest of transparency , ” the US must acknowledge mistaken killings publicly . later that month , he recognized that the US government “ should make public the overall numbers of civilian deaths resulting from US strikes targeting Al Qaeda . ”
it should come as no surprise , then , that civilians like Nasser , who have lost mothers , fathers , sons , and daughters in US strikes , are outraged not only at the US , but also at the Yemeni government , which consented to the attacks . they believe that instead of making Yemen and the US safer , drone strikes only strengthen support for Al Qaeda .
but , as “ Death by Drone ” shows , the US drone program is fundamentally flawed and should not be perpetuated . the Obama administration ’ s recent admissions that its drone strikes killed its own citizens only underscore this fact .
can Yemen Be Saved ?
Sana &apos;A – Yemen is no stranger to crisis . exposed to a regional proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia , plagued by an entrenched Al Qaeda affiliate , and divided by tribal disputes and a secession movement , the country has become a poster child for everything that can go wrong in the Arab world .
Yemen has demonstrated remarkable resiliency in the past . to ensure that the recent overthrow of its government by the Shia Houthi rebel movement does not deal Yemen the lethal blow that it has avoided so far , the international community must not abandon the country in what may be its hour of greatest need .
the origins of the Houthi movement date to 1991 , when it was created to protect Zaydism , a moderate form of Shi &apos;ism , from the encroachment of Sunni Islamists . after the attacks on New York and Washington , DC , on September 11 , 2001 , the group &apos;s battle took on a geopolitical dimension , as its fighters objected to Yemen &apos;s decision to collaborate with the United States and enhance bilateral intelligence cooperation .
yet it never managed to expand its reach beyond its stronghold in the north of the country . that changed in 2011 , when the popular protests and political chaos stemming from the Arab Spring led to widespread institutional paralysis , allowing the Houthis to march past a military that largely refused to fight it .
the group &apos;s power grab has frightened its adversaries , leading them to seek new alliances that could imperil the state &apos;s security . in the central region of Marib , home to the oil and gas facilities that Yemen relies on for foreign currency , several tribes have vowed to fight the Houthis .
the situation is no less precarious in the southern provinces , where a secession movement has been active since 2007 . southerners are up in arms because the Houthi rebellion halted plans for the adoption of a federal system , which would have given the region greater autonomy .
many in the region worry that the Houthis will discriminate against them further . AQAP is firmly rooted in this region as well , implying the possibility that local residents will seek its help in defending against an expected Houthi onslaught .
meanwhile , Yemen continues to serve as a battleground in a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia . Iran has armed and trained the Houthis , and , though the rebels &apos; brand of Shi &apos;ism shares little with that practiced in Tehran , they have praised the Islamic Republic &apos;s founder , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , and held up Iran &apos;s Lebanese proxy , Hezbollah , as a model to be emulated .
decreased earnings led Yemen to forecast a $ 3.2 billion budget deficit last year . if the turmoil is not curtailed and the Saudis do not resume the payments that have long ensured the country &apos;s ability to function , Yemen may not be able to cover its expenditures .
Yemen &apos;s military is largely intact , having remained in its barracks as the Houthis marched to the capital , and there is little evidence that the units that work with the Americans are loyal to the new rebel government . suspending cooperation risks giving AQAP free rein in a country where it was able to wreak havoc even when bridled .
Yemen is mired in crises that it cannot solve alone . unless its international allies throw it a lifeline , it risks being swallowed by a sea of disorder that could imperil the entire region .
Yemen ’ s Regime Change Gets Personal
SANAA – When Yemen ’ s President Ali Abdullah Saleh ordered his military on March 18 to fire on peaceful protesters calling for his resignation , he sealed his fate . a wave of military , government , and diplomatic defections , led by his long-time ally First Armored Brigade Commander General Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar , rocked his regime .
but , although al-Ahmar announced that he was appalled by the use of force and vowed to defend the constitution , his decision was anything but altruistic . the disgruntled general , who has long-standing ties to the type of jihadists that the United States is battling in Yemen , merely sought to settle a score with the president ’ s family .
the relationship between al-Ahmar and Saleh extends to their youth , with Saleh ’ s mother having had a second marriage to al-Ahmar ’ s uncle . though they are not half-brothers , this frequent , if mistaken reference , indicates their closeness .
but , as Saleh prepared the way for his son Ahmad – the head of the Presidential Guard – to succeed him , he began to marginalize al-Ahmar . in 2009 , Saleh sacked al-Ahmar ’ s key backers , including Central Command Chief General al-Thahiri al-Shadadi and Lieutenant General Haydar al-Sanhani , from power .
al-Ahmar has also not benefited from the military aid that the US lavished on Yemen in the wake of al-Qaeda ’ s failed Christmas Day plot in 2009 to down an American airliner . while the Central Security Service , led by Saleh ’ s nephew Yahya , has received millions of dollars to fight al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , al-Ahmar has been left out of the economic bonanza .
at the same time , al-Ahmar ’ s dismal performance in spearheading the war against the Houthi-led sectarian rebellion in the north made him a convenient scapegoat for the regime ’ s failures . the regime ’ s desire to get al-Ahmar out of the picture became clear during the last round of fighting aginst the Houthis in 2009-2010 , when Saudi Arabia began bombing the rebels .
so his decision to abandon Saleh stemmed less from his love of the constitution and democracy than from his desire to even the score with the president and his son Ahmad Saleh , with whom he has long clashed . their units skirmished during the Houthi campaign , and the two engaged in a power struggle over defense of the radio and television stations .
he is married to the sister of Tariq al-Fadhli , a Yemeni who fought alongside al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladin in Afghanistan . when more than 4,000 Arabs returned from fighting the Soviets there , al-Ahmar organized them into units and deployed them in the 1994 civil war .
one jihadist who trained in al-Qaeda ’ s camps , and met bin Ladin , told me that upon his return from Afghanistan , he was invited to meet al-Ahmar ’ s associates and was given a monthly stipend . during a 1999 trial of Yemenis convicted of kidnapping 16 Europeans , it emerged that the group ’ s ringleader called al-Ahmar during the ordeal .
of Yemen ’ s four regional commanders , only Southern Command Chief General Mahdi Maqwala still backs him . lesser lieutenant generals have deserted the president in droves .
his forces have already clashed with rival units in Mukalla and surrounded the presidential palace in Aden . if the Salehs retain control of the air force , which remains under the control of Saleh ’ s half-brother , employing it against defecting military divisions would likely lead to a bloodbath .
nevertheless , the doomsday scenarios predicting anarchy and chaos in the post-Saleh era are most likely exaggerated . unlike in Egypt , the vacuum resulting from Saleh ’ s departure can be quickly filled , so the country need not fall back on a military oligarchy .
and , unlike in Egypt , where the ruling party was detested and out of touch with the masses , Yemen ’ s General People ’ s Congress has some following in society . if Saleh leaves peacefully and represses the urge to unleash the last remaining loyal army units against protesters and defecting soldiers , the country can avert Libya-like mayhem .
with the sun quickly setting on the Saleh era , the president is out of options . the only decision before him and his thinning ranks of allies is whether to leave peacefully or go down fighting .

Asia ’ s Military Revolution
Seoul – A vast revolution in military affairs is taking place across East Asia . the latest signs are Chinese President Xi Jinping ’ s purge of General Xu Caihou , an ex-Politburo member and former vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission , on charges of corruption , and Japan ’ s “ reinterpretation ” of Article 9 of its constitution to permit the country to provide military aid to its allies .
despite the rising regional tensions that inspired these moves , China ’ s relations with its neighbors and the United States are not fated to lead to direct confrontation . but the relentless march of new initiatives to meet the perceived “ China threat ” will require the region ’ s political leaders , including the Chinese , to address their disputes in new and more creative ways if that outcome is to be avoided .
in general , there are three ways to foster international peace : deepening economic interdependence , promoting democracy , and building international institutions . unfortunately , because East Asia ’ s political leaders have failed to pursue the latter objective , they now find themselves playing dangerous balance-of-power games reminiscent of Europe a century ago .
the region ’ s business leaders have been unable to prevent deteriorating foreign relations from harming their interests . by contrast , military lobbying now deeply influences foreign and defense policies – witness China ’ s double-digit increase in defense spending and rising US arms sales in the region .
international-relations theorists since Immanuel Kant have held that democracies rarely ( if ever ) fight one another ; as a result , political leaders , such as US President Woodrow Wilson , have tried to promote democracy as a means to spread peace . until recently , the US seemed to have assumed that China ’ s engagement with Western democracies would bolster peaceful ties .
but , since the 2008 financial crisis , China ’ s confidence in its authoritarian development model has grown stronger . its leaders now increasingly appear to believe that a new “ Beijing Consensus ” of mercantilism and state intervention has replaced the old “ Washington Consensus ” of free trade and deregulation .
in the late nineteenth century , a rising US was able to cooperate with a declining Britain , owing to their shared culture and values . China ’ s leaders , however , tend to suspect that the US is deliberately trying to undermine their country ’ s political stability by questioning its record on human rights and political freedoms .
it is this ideological divide that is undermining the development in East Asia of institutions that establish principles , rules , and decision-making procedures for the region . while much of the West is bound together by institutions like the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe and NATO , East Asia ’ s main body , the ASEAN Regional Forum , is too weak to play an analogous role , leaving the region beset with unregulated rivalries .
so far , US and East Asian leaders have done little beyond offering rhetorical support for the creation of multilateral security institutions . with the exception of the almost defunct six-party talks aimed at eliminating the nuclear threat posed by North Korea , Asia ’ s powers refuse to be constrained by international rules or norms .
instead , East Asia ’ s leaders resort to realpolitik . unfortunately , unlike Europe ’ s nineteenth-century political masterminds – figures like Talleyrand , Metternich , Bismarck , and Disraeli – who crafted durable international alliances , Asia lacks leaders willing and able to look beyond their narrow national interests .
for example , China ’ s leaders seem to believe that the 2008 economic crisis and the high costs of two foreign wars have left the US in no position to exercise international leadership . that may explain China ’ s recent foreign-policy assertiveness , particularly in its dispute with Japan over control of the Senkaku / Diaoyu Islands , which could be intended to probe the strength of the US-Japan alliance .
its interests in East Asia date back to the late nineteenth century . just as Britain refused to concede naval supremacy to Germany a century ago , the US will not easily accept any Chinese challenge to its strategic position in the western Pacific , especially given that so many East Asian states are pleading for US protection .
China and the US need to talk . despite their economic interdependence and some 90 inter-governmental channels for bilateral dialogue , the two superpowers are caught in a perilous tug-of-war over interests in the East and South China Seas and the western Pacific .
Sino-Japanese relations are particularly fraught , with two decades of economic stagnation in Japan and rapid growth in China fueling nationalist overreaction on both sides . having become accustomed to outsourcing its security to the US , and despite having the world ’ s third-largest economy , Japan neglected to develop its own constructive diplomatic vision .
it does not help that the US wants Japan to shoulder more of the burden of maintaining Asia ’ s security , a position that may make sense strategically and financially , but that betrays a lack of understanding of the political context . the US seems to underestimate regional concerns over Japan ’ s potential remilitarization .
serious efforts and far-reaching compromises are needed to begin the process of building institutions for regional security cooperation . otherwise , the much-heralded “ Asian century , ” far from bringing economic prosperity and peace , will be an age of suspicion and peril .
a Prisoner ’ s Reflections on Nelson Mandela
as a prisoner , I have been forced to focus on what is essential about myself , my political beliefs , and my country . so I can almost feel the presence of the brave women and men , old and young , who have gathered in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities to defend their dreams of a democratic and European future .
I am sure that Nelson Mandela would have understood my feelings and agreed . the South African apartheid regime may have locked him away for almost three decades , but in the great Soweto protests and the other demonstrations for freedom and equality , courageous young South Africans invariably looked to his example and felt his presence .
around the world , most people now rightly celebrate the gentle dignity with which Mandela led South Africa out of the political wilderness . even here , behind prison bars and 24-hour surveillance of the type that he experienced for so long , I can conjure the warmth of his broad smile , merry eyes , and those colorful Hawaiian-style shirts that he wore with such panache .
and I can admire his unyielding – and , yes , sometimes wily – commitment to reconciliation , which saved his country from the race war that those who refused to accept the end of white-minority rule saw as inevitable . how wrong they were , and how miraculous was Mandela ’ s achievement in making even his most implacable enemies feel at home in post-apartheid South Africa .
all that Mandela demanded was that the truth about the past be revealed . through the unique innovation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission , Mandela found the only viable bridge between his country ’ s racist legacy and its multi-racial present and future – a combination of political genius and humane wisdom that only the greatest of leaders possess .
Mandela was able to guide South Africa to freedom , because he was able to see its future more clearly than those who lived through the apartheid years outside of prison . indeed , he possessed that rare clarity of moral vision that prison – perhaps like no other environment – can nurture .
“ Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states , nor between classes , nor between political parties , either – but right through every human heart – and through all human hearts , ” he wrote in The Gulag Archipelago . “ This line shifts … .And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil , one small bridgehead of good is retained .
the ability to begin to see more clearly than most the inner workings of the human soul is one of the few gifts that imprisonment can bestow . forced to reckon with your own vulnerability , isolation , and losses ( and seemingly lost cause ) , you learn to look more carefully into the human heart – yours and that of your jailers .
Mandela epitomized this rare gift . how else could he have personally invited one of his Robben Island jailers to attend his inauguration as South Africa ’ s first democratically elected president ?
and he bore the anguish of the suffering imposed on his family . and yet he neither broke nor surrendered to the rage that would have consumed most people .
as usual , Mandela ’ s own words about his day of personal liberation show how well he understood this : “ As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom , I knew if I didn ’ t leave my bitterness and hatred behind , I ’ d still be in prison . ”

sweet Caroline in Tokyo
Tokyo – Fifty years have passed since the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy , with official ceremonies held in Washington , DC , and Dallas to commemorate the anniversary . but JFK ’ s eldest daughter , Caroline Kennedy , was not present at either event ; she had just taken up her post in Tokyo as the 29th US Ambassador to Japan .
on November 19 , thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of Kennedy as she made her way from Tokyo Station to the Imperial Palace , around a kilometer away , by horse-drawn carriage to present her credentials to the emperor . waving to the onlookers , she looked like Snow White .
November 22 , 1963 , was also the day satellite broadcasting from the United States to Japan began , and many Japanese got up early to watch a speech by JFK in Dallas that began at 5 : 30 a.m. But , rather than airing the speech , the broadcast brought the shocking news of the assassination .
the image of young Caroline – the inspiration for Neil Diamond ’ s famous song – solemnly standing beside her three-year-old brother as he saluted his father ’ s coffin is deeply engrained in the hearts of Japan ’ s people . so there probably is not a single Japanese who would not welcome her as US Ambassador .
there have been academic experts on Japan , like the acclaimed scholar Edwin Reischauer . there have also been political heavyweights , such as Michael Mansfield , a long-time Democratic majority leader of the US Senate , former Vice President Walter Mondale , former Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas Foley , and Senator Howard Baker , who also served as President Ronald Reagan ’ s chief of staff .
clearly , Caroline Kennedy , an important early supporter of President Barack Obama , is in this category . indeed , her backing for Obama in the Democratic Party primaries in 2008 , when he was still a relatively unknown senator from Illinois , gave his campaign credibility among party insiders who remain loyal to her family ’ s legacy .
Kennedy ’ s address to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during her confirmation hearing elicited bipartisan support – a rare occurrence nowadays , given America ’ s highly polarized national politics – and she received unanimous approval . although she lacks formal political or diplomatic experience , her personal connections , particularly to Obama , will have great significance for US-Japan relations .
for example , there are security questions related to strengthening the alliance between Japan and the US , including the relocation of the Futenma Air Station , the base of operations for the US Marine Corps on Okinawa . there are also issues related to economic cooperation , such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , the proposed mega-regional free-trade treaty covering Pacific Rim economies .
if this roadblock cannot be overcome and the agreement stalls , the Abe government ’ s approval ratings will suffer , despite progress in the negotiations . given the unanimity with which Kennedy was confirmed , she may be able to use her own political capital to help sell fast-track authority in Congress .
who Lost Thailand ?
that indifference is not only foolish ; it is dangerous . Asia ’ s democracies now risk confronting the same harsh question that the United States faced when Mao Zedong marched into Beijing , and again when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ousted the Shah in Iran .
much of the world is wondering how such a successful economy could allow its politics to spin out of control . what accounts for the armies of protesters – distinguished , gang-like , by the color of their shirts – whose mutual antipathy often borders on nihilistic rage ?
the roots of the current unrest extend back more than a decade , to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra ’ s first electoral victory in 2001 . Thaksin ’ s triumph did not represent the normal alternation in power that one finds in a democracy .
yet Thaksin ’ s supporters did not abandon him . when Thailand ’ s military returned to their barracks , many Thai citizens voted for Thaksin at one remove , with his sister – Yingluck Shinawatra , a long-time executive at Thaksin ’ s communications firm – becoming Prime Minister , supported by a powerful parliamentary majority .
she proposed an amnesty law that would have not only pardoned opposition leaders , including Abhisit Vejjajiva , her predecessor as prime minister ( who faces murder charges ) , but allowed her brother to return to the country . and , in defiance of a Supreme Court ruling , she sought a constitutional amendment that would make the Senate , whose members are appointed , an elected body .
the opposition , sensing that its moment had arrived , launched a wave of street protests . Yingluck , in an effort to defuse the situation , called for a parliamentary election in February .
so , in essence , what is happening in Thailand is an attempted nullification of democracy by the opposition and the country ’ s entrenched elite . unable to compete successfully with Thaksin for votes , they now want to dilute Thai democracy in order to prevent the electorate from ever again choosing a government that goes against their will .
but Thailand is Southeast Asia ’ s lynchpin economy . it is a key partner for Myanmar ( Burma ) as it makes its own political and economic transition , and it is a hub for trade with neighboring Cambodia , Laos , and Vietnam .
likewise , Japan and India have long regarded Thailand as a democratic bulwark in a neighborhood where some regimes – Cambodia and Laos – are firmly under China ’ s hegemonic sway . indeed , its government has proved to be a strong supporter of Myanmar ’ s president , Thein Sein , as he seeks to free his country from China ’ s tight embrace .
by standing aside as Thailand ’ s opposition and traditional elite seek to undermine the country ’ s democracy in the name of a permanent right to rule , Asia ’ s democracies risk driving some elements of the Thaksin camp into the arms of China , which would happily accept the role of patron to so potent a political force .
Thailand ’ s military has long and respectful ties not only with the US military , but with officers in Japan as well . Thailand ’ s opposition politicians , many of whom were educated at top Western universities , may also be open to quiet advice that they are pushing things too far , not only putting Thailand ’ s stability at risk , but also jeopardizing regional security .
just as , a decade ago , the West objected to the efforts of Turkey ’ s entrenched secular elite to rob Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ’ s mildly Islamist AKP party of its democratic victory , it needs to speak clearly today in defense of Thai democracy . the opposition ’ s claim that it is acting in the interests of the world ’ s democracies needs to be rebutted .
Thaksin may be no saint , and some constitutional reform will be needed if political reconciliation is to come about . but Thaksin ’ s governments , like that of his sister , have kept China at one remove from influence .
should Yingluck be ousted in a coup , or should the country ’ s democracy be hollowed out to preclude her return to power , the Shinawatras may be left with no choice but to seek support from Thailand ’ s giant neighbor to the north . if that happens , we will all know who lost Thailand .
equality or Estrangement
Tokyo – Those whom the gods would destroy , they grant their wishes . will that bit of ancient wisdom now hold for the United States and Japan ?
for a half-century , the US , which wrote Japan ’ s postwar “ peace ” constitution , has pressed the Japanese to play a greater role in maintaining Asian and global stability . but now that Japan finally has a leader who agrees , the US is getting nervous , with Secretary of State John Kerry supposedly calling Japan under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe “ unpredictable . ”
these strains in the US-Japan relationship – surely the foundation stone of Asian stability – first became noticeable in December , when Abe visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo , which houses the “ souls ” of ( among others ) Class A war criminals from the Pacific War . the US has always criticized Japanese officials ’ visits to the shrine , but through diplomatic channels .
such suspicions were sharpened after China declared its new Air Defense Identification Zone , which overlaps Japanese sovereign territory . the US tried to have it both ways : though the Obama administration sent US bombers through the new ADIZ to demonstrate its refusal to recognize China ’ s move , it also told US commercial airliners to acknowledge the zone and report their flight plans to the Chinese authorities .
likewise , US acquiescence in China ’ s de facto ouster of the Philippines from the Scarborough Shoal ( a disputed outcropping in the South China Sea ) raised questions in Japan about the two countries ’ supposed harmony of interests . in fact , although the US extols the virtues of its partnership with Japan , successive American presidents have been vague about the details .
Abe ’ s conception of the US-Japan partnership presupposes much greater equality . after all , a society like Japan , trying to escape two decades of economic malaise , cannot feel completely comfortable outsourcing its national-security strategy , even to an ally that is as respected and reliable as the US .
far from being based on chest-thumping nationalism , Abe ’ s national-security strategy reflects , above all , a deep awareness of how a lost generation of economic growth has affected the Japanese . his bravura diplomatic performances sometimes give the impression that a self-confident Japan has been a normal feature of the global landscape .
indeed , Abe has succeeded so well in returning Japan to the world stage that his US and Asian critics act as if the only problem now is to moderate Japanese self-confidence – a notion that would have been laughable just two years ago . but the fact remains that one of Abe ’ s primary worries is the spiritual malaise that accompanied Japan ’ s long economic stagnation .
the US , however , regards Abe ’ s worries about Japan ’ s spirit as peripheral to its efforts to forge a lasting relationship with China and overhaul its strategic presence in the Pacific . for example , the US views the Trans-Pacific Partnership – the huge trade agreement involving it , Japan , and 10 other leading Pacific Rim countries – as a technical scheme that will bring economic benefits through greater trade .
both generally view China as having embarked on a probing strategy in search of weak spots where it can expand its geopolitical reach . and both believe that only when China is convinced that such probes will yield no lasting benefit can serious negotiations about a comprehensive security structure for Asia take place .
the US , convinced of the importance of intentions in the conduct of foreign policy , believes that once China recognizes the limits to its power , a structure of peace will follow naturally . Abe , by contrast , believes that only a favorable balance of power can be relied upon , and he is determined that Japan play its part in constructing that balance .
although Abe has lifted Japan ’ s sights and self-confidence , he recognizes that Japan faces real limits . the US , too , should recognize that there are limits to the extent of the subordination that it can ask of an ally .
securing Japan
that policy , almost instantly dubbed “ Abenomics , ” comprises what have been called the three “ arrows ” : bold monetary policy , an expansionary fiscal stance , and structural reforms to stimulate private investment . hosting the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2020 has added a fourth arrow to this quiver in the form of increased infrastructure investment and tourism revenue in the years leading up to the Games .
to be sure , after 15 years of deflationary recession , revitalization of the Japanese economy remains far from complete . nonetheless , the effects of Abe ’ s reforms are becoming visible in areas such as equity prices and exchange rates .
indeed , he confronted many of the same issues during his first administration seven years ago . his efforts back then were halted by his own resignation , and he is now making a second attempt to establish a national-security governance system to meet Japan ’ s needs – and those of its allies – in twenty-first-century Asia .
the bill that Abe has submitted aims to establish a Japanese National Security Council , based on lessons from the successes and failures of similar institutions in other countries , such as the NSC in the United States . the Security Council of Japan – something of a stopgap measure created to provide advice from relevant cabinet members to the prime minister in times of crisis – will now be reorganized as a formal institution .
the new NSC ’ s membership will be limited to the prime minister , the cabinet secretary , and the foreign and defense ministers , with relevant ministers added on an ad hoc basis . a permanent National Security Secretariat , headed by a person with abundant diplomatic experience , will be established in the prime minister ’ s office , with 60 security specialists from various fields laying the policy groundwork for medium- and long-term national security strategy .
Japan , like other countries , has faced jurisdictional disputes among foreign-policy , defense , and police agencies that have hindered the aggregation and analysis of intelligence information . but , with the creation of the NSC , each ministry and agency will report important national-security information to the new secretariat , which will then carry out integrated analysis and issue reports to the prime minister and others .
as we can already see , it will not be easy to overcome the obstacles posed by vertically integrated ministries and agencies . institutionalization will take time – and the importance of its success cannot be understated .
for example , the new NSC will be responsible for sharing intelligence with other countries , including the US , Japan ’ s most important ally . as a result , ensuring the protection of information will be a key issue , particularly given the old habit of leaking security information to the press .
moreover , the long decades of peace since 1945 have served to lower awareness among politicians of the need for confidentiality . for example , Japanese newspapers always report when , where , and with whom the Prime Minister met for dinner in the following day ’ s editions .
yet the goals of national security and crisis management are the same in both systems – indeed , one of British Prime Minister David Cameron ’ s first acts when he came to power was to establish an NSC to improve coordination of policymaking . although the establishment of the Japanese NSC is long overdue , it is not too late for Japan to benefit from the improvement in policy direction and coherence that it seems certain to bring .
how to End an Insurgency
the MILF was not deterred by the popular overthrow of Marcos ’ s 20-year dictatorship in 1986 , following the assassination of the opposition leader Benigno Aquino , Jr . nor did the establishment of democracy – now deeply entrenched – inspire the group ’ s leaders to reconsider their approach .
Aquino ’ s approach to the negotiations reflected his recognition that the MILF had twice used peace talks – once brokered by Libya ’ s Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi – as a cynical ploy to buy time to regroup and raise funds ( including from Al Qaeda ) . with freshly restocked arsenals , they would relaunch their campaign to seize Mindanao by force .
but , over time , the effort gained credibility . though questions about the peace agreement ’ s durability remain , with full disarmament yet to take place , the political autonomy granted to the country ’ s Muslim areas seems to have persuaded most MILF fighters that the time has come to end the carnage .
in the few short months since the peace deal was reached , Filipino and foreign investment has been flowing into the island . with nearly half of Mindanao ’ s population living below the poverty line , these funds could not be more critical .
but the benefits of Aquino ’ s leadership are not limited to Mindanao . his entire presidency , which began in 2010 , has been characterized by the creativity and doggedness that made peace with the MILF possible .
Aquino ’ s efforts to fight corruption and rebuild his country ’ s economic foundations has enabled the Philippines – at long last – to become Southeast Asia ’ s fastest-growing economy , with annual GDP growth of 7.2 % last year . while growth is expected to slow slightly this year , to 6.5 % , the Philippines can now be counted among Asia ’ s “ tiger ” economies .
some ten million Filipinos – one-quarter of the workforce ­ – ­ are compelled to seek employment overseas , owing to inadequate opportunities at home . if the Philippines is to attract enough investment to achieve living standards comparable to Malaysia and Thailand , Aquino must remain persistent in his efforts to open the economy and curtail corruption .
nowhere is this more apparent than in his willingness to stand up to China ’ s territorial claims in the South China Sea . indeed , the Philippines is challenging China ’ s claims in the International Court of Arbitration , using provisions from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .
Aquino ’ s stern criticism of China ’ s expansionist policies has certainly not endeared him to the Chinese . but regional powers like the United States and Japan have supported his stance , with Japan promising to deliver enhanced equipment for the Philippine Coast Guard .
Japan ’ s Russian Dilemma
Tokyo – For Japanese leaders and citizens , President Vladimir Putin ’ s brutal annexation of Crimea was an unsurprising return to the normal paradigm of Russian history . indeed , most Japanese regard the move as having been determined by some expansionist gene in Russia ’ s political DNA , rather than by Putin himself or the specifics of the Ukraine crisis .
Japan is particularly concerned with Russian expansionism , because it is the only G-7 country that currently has a territorial dispute with Russia , which has occupied its Northern Territories since the waning days of World War II .
concerned that America ’ s development and use of atomic weapons against Japan would deprive the Soviet Union of any territorial gains in the east , Stalin ordered the Red Army to invade . but Japan , having already endured the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , had accepted the Potsdam Declaration on August 14 , meaning that the war was already over when the Red Army marched in .
since then , these islands have been controlled by either the Soviet Union or its successor state , Russia . and , as elsewhere in Russia , their residents have been impoverished by consistently incompetent and corrupt government , whether run by Communists or today ’ s crony capitalists .
after coming to power at the end of 2012 , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had sought to improve relations with Putin in the hope of beginning serious talks on the Northern Territories . but now that Putin has made his project of imperial restoration crystal clear , those hopes are stillborn .
recognizing this , Abe condemned the annexation of Crimea , calling it “ a violation of Ukraine ’ s integrity and the integrity of its sovereignty and territory . ” Abe added that “ attempts to change the status quo by force cannot be overlooked , ” and that Japan would consider further economic sanctions against Russia in cooperation with the G-7 .
needless to say , these remarks underscored the fact that Japanese territory and territorial waters are being threatened “ by force ” in the East China Sea by China . the lesson now being drawn is that , where territorial disputes are concerned , Japan must not kowtow to “ attempts to change the status quo backed by force . ”
but when Putin invaded Ukraine , China showed the hollowness of its adherence to this principle . instead of condemning Russia for invading and annexing Crimea , it abstained at the United Nations Security Council , and has offered more criticism of Ukraine ’ s new popular government than it has of Putin ’ s thuggish behavior .
in the immediate future , Japan will work with the G-7 to ensure that Putin ’ s reckless ambitions do not endanger other parts of Ukraine . already , Japan has decided to provide ¥ 150 billion ( $ 1.5 billion ) in economic aid for Ukraine , the largest pledge by any individual country , including the US , thus far .
before the Crimea invasion , territorial negotiations between Japan and Russia showed signs of progress . moreover , several bilateral economic cooperation efforts , such as projects involving liquefied natural gas , were moving forward .
more important , Japan understands that business as usual with an aggressive Russia that undermines the international order could embolden others closer to home to embrace Putin ’ s lawless tactics . the days of an inward looking Japan are over .
Abenomics ’ Women Problem
Tokyo – When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addressed the United Nations General Assembly last week , he emphasized his determination to build a society in which women shine . indeed , creating opportunities for women in the workforce is an essential pillar of the government ’ s reform program , so-called “ Abenomics . ”
according to an analysis by researchers at Goldman Sachs , closing the gender gap could boost GDP by 9 % in the United States and nearly 13 % in Japan . during his stay in New York , Abe also discussed “ womenomics ” with Hillary Clinton , who had made empowering women in the economy a key policy goal during her tenure as US Secretary of State .
Abe , strange to say , is the first Japanese leader to grasp that the underutilization of women ’ s skills has been holding back Japan ’ s economy . Japan ranked 105th out of 136 countries in the World Economic Forum ’ s “ Global Gender Gap Report 2013 , ” down from 101st place in 2012 .
in his cabinet reshuffle earlier this month , five female ministers were appointed , but in the face of strong opposition from male MPs . more important , the appointments amounted to painting over the cracks : only 39 of the 480 members of the Japanese Diet ’ s lower house , or 7.9 % , are women .
things are just as bad at lower levels of government , where women account for a mere 13.1 % of representatives in local parliaments , more than 40 % of which have no female members at all . as the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party , Abe should instruct local party branches to choose more female candidates to run in next April ’ s local elections .
it is also worrying that some of the women Abe has selected for his cabinet and for key party posts are arch-conservatives who advocate that women stay at home and take care of children . given this , one cannot help feeling uncertain about the credibility of his womenomics initiatives .
that is especially true when one considers the lack of women in corporate management positions . everyone at the meeting of the Keidanren , the Federation of Economic Organizations , to welcome US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy were men in dark suits .
in 2003 , Norway revised its corporation law to state that companies that failed to place women in 40 % of management positions could face delisting . if the same law were applied to Japan today , every company would be delisted .
women currently hold an estimated 9 % of senior management positions in Japan , compared to 40 % in the Philippines , 24 % in France , and 22 % in the United States . one reason that Japan ’ s consumer electronics manufacturers are no longer world-beaters is that they have not fully used their female employees in managerial positions , despite their varied experiences .
though there is no proof that the former caused the latter , Matsumoto ’ s commitment to lead in this area suggests that corporate dynamism may well increase with a more prominent role for women . likewise , Daiwa Securities CEO Shigeharu Suzuki has appointed women as executive officers to improve sales capabilities , with promising results .
although the employment rate of women in Japan reached 69.5 % in 2013 , more than 60 % of women leave the workplace prematurely , mostly owing to childbirth . this pattern results from institutional impediments to achieving a viable work-family balance – impediments that embody the harsh view of male superiors and colleagues toward working mothers .
changing this view is not easy , because the Confucian belief that women belong in the home remains embedded in Japanese and some other Asian societies . moreover , most of the people participating in forums or workshops focused on womenomics are women ; too often , these events simply turn into platforms for women to complain among themselves .
tipping Points to Asia ’ s Future
Tokyo – A week , it is said , is a long time in politics . but events in Asia over the past week may define the region for decades to come .
Thailand , one of Asia ’ s most prosperous countries , seems determined to render itself a basket case . a military coup , imposed following the Thai constitutional court ’ s ouster of an elected government on spurious legal grounds , can lead only to an artificial peace .
to Thailand ’ s east , Vietnam is the latest Asian country to feel pinched by China ’ s policy of creating facts on the ground , or in this case at sea , to enhance its sovereignty claims on disputed territory . Vietnam ’ s government reacted vigorously to China ’ s placement of a huge , exploratory oilrig near the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea .
renewed protests over China ’ s mining investments in Myanmar this week confirmed this trend , one that China ’ s leaders seem either to dismiss as trivial , or to regard as somehow unrelated to their bullying . indeed , like Russian President Vladimir Putin , who faces widespread public antipathy in Ukraine , China ’ s leaders appear to believe that popular protests against them can only be the product of an American plot .
yet , despite their shared contempt for expressions of the popular will , China ’ s President Xi Jinping and Putin struggled , during Putin ’ s two-day visit to Shanghai , to agree on a new gas deal that the Kremlin desperately needs . Putin had viewed China as his backup option should the West seek to isolate Russia following its annexation of Crimea .
Xi ’ s self-confidence reflected not only the Chinese leadership ’ s contempt for Putin ’ s mismanagement of the Russian economy , but also the fact that China ’ s energy worries have lessened considerably of late . successful deployment of hydraulic fracturing ( “ fracking ” ) technology in Xinjiang suggests that China , like America , will soon be able to draw on its own reserves of shale energy .
China ’ s hard bargaining with Russia has exposed the limits of the two countries ’ bilateral cooperation , which has important geo-strategic consequences for Asia and the world . China , it now seems , is happy to see Putin poke his finger in the West ’ s eye and challenge America ’ s global leadership .
but the most epochal events of the last week took place in two of Asia ’ s great democracies : India and Japan . Narendra Modi ’ s landslide victory in India ’ s general election was not only a huge personal triumph for the son of a tea seller , but may well mark a decisive break with India ’ s traditional inward-looking policies .
quietly , a panel appointed by Abe ’ s government this week offered a reinterpretation of a key element of Article 9 of Japan ’ s constitution . for the first time since the Pacific War ’ s end in 1945 , Japan ’ s Self-Defense Forces would be able to participate in “ collective self-defense ” – meaning that Japan could come to the aid of its allies should they come under attack .
but the new interpretation of Article 9 augurs just the opposite : it embeds Japan ’ s military within an alliance system that has been , and will remain , the backbone of Asia ’ s prevailing structure of peace . Abe will make this clear when he delivers the keynote address in Singapore at this year ’ s Shangri La Dialogue , the annual meeting of Asian military and civilian military leaders .
clear-sighted Chinese must already see that , short of a victorious war , such dominance is impossible . now is the moment for China to anchor its rise within a stable and mutually acceptable Asian regional order .
the Pyongyang Purge
Tokyo – During the Cold War , the term “ Kremlinology ” referred to efforts to understand what was taking place at the commanding heights of the Soviet Union – indeed , behind the entire Iron Curtain . Kremlinologists monitored ( in whatever way possible ) who was up and who was down among the core Soviet leadership .
all of that was grammar-school stuff compared to efforts to decipher the regime in North Korea , where the truth is far more opaque .
Jang Song-thaek had been seen as a kind of regent to Kim Jong-un , the young successor to the Kim family dynasty , and was thought to be number two in the regime . but he owed his position to his wife , Kim Kyong-hui , the only sister of Kim Jong-il , Kim Jong-un ’ s deceased father .
Jang ’ s tact , as well as his usefulness as an interlocutor with China , enabled him to keep his position , despite his long-term separation from his wife . but in North Korea , blood is paramount : everything , including ideology and the national interest , is subservient to the maintenance of the Kim dynasty .
I have long believed that the true holder of power since Kim Jong-il ’ s death has been his sister , Kim Kyong-hui , and no one else . North Korean culture would suggest that women do not take positions of leadership , but it appears that she was the only family member whom Kim Jong-il could trust .
it has even been suggested that she made the decision to purge her husband . though it cannot be known whether she also proposed killing him , it is not surprising that she believed that , with her own health failing , she could not leave the family dynasty to her husband ’ s care .
elsewhere in the communist world , such murderous purges were renounced long ago , first in the Soviet Union by Khrushchev , following his denunciation of Stalin , and then in China by Deng Xiaoping , following his rehabilitation and return to power in the late 1970 ’ s . this “ reform ” did not make these regimes any more beneficent or efficient , but it did bring a degree of stability and predictability to their behavior .
more disturbing is the question of whether China is going down a parallel path under President Xi Jinping . ever since Deng ’ s rule , there has been an understanding that members of the Chinese Communist Party ’ s Politburo are not to be touched , even in retirement .
China ’ s emphasis since Deng on rule by consensus may not have made the country any more democratic , but it at least prevented the re-emergence of a new cult of personality à la Mao Zedong . the question today is whether Xi ’ s flouting of this internal party convention is another step in re-creating one-man – and thus completely arbitrary – rule in China .
and now , with Jang purged , responsibility for economic failure in North Korea has been shifted to Choe . all officials and people related to him now live under the shadow of the executioner , for he is certain to bear the blame when the dynasty needs a scapegoat for its mounting problems .
while China lost a convenient point of contact with the Kim regime , North Korea may have lost the only channel by which to sustain itself . the economy cannot be revived so long as international sanctions are maintained , and the sanctions seem certain to remain in place so long as the regime continues with its nuclear brinkmanship .
so the day is fast approaching when Kim Jong-un and his clan will have to take responsibility for the country ’ s dire condition , and it may come soon after Kim Kyong-hui dies . if so , the Kim dynasty ’ s last chapter may have begun with the current spasm of executions , though the ending – for the Korean Peninsula and East Asia alike – remains very much in doubt .
the New Neutrality
Tokyo – Throughout the Cold War , the Soviet Union used every imaginable threat and inducement – including the ultimate prize of reunification – to bring about a neutral Germany . but German leaders of both the left and the right , from Konrad Adenauer to Willy Brandt , spurned every Soviet offer .
countries join alliances , or entities such as the European Union , because these groups make the benefits and obligations of membership as unambiguous as anything in international relations can be . for Germany and South Korea , however , relationships with historic allies – NATO and the United States , respectively – appear to be changing before our eyes .
China ’ s embrace of South Korea is part of a long-term strategy to turn it into a subordinate state in terms of foreign and national security policy ( much as Finland kowtowed to the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War ) . and yet , though courted by all sides in the struggle to maintain stability in Northeast Asia , South Korea now runs the risk of becoming isolated .
given its insecurity , a by-product of the Korean Peninsula ’ s long division , South Korea requires , above all , calm and steady partners . but frequent changes in US policy toward Northeast Asia in recent years have disoriented South Korean policymakers , while Chinese policy , though consistent , confronts South Korea ’ s leaders with choices that they appear unprepared to make .
as a result , South Korea ’ s elite appears to be splitting into pro-Chinese and pro-American factions that transcend party lines . over a period of time , the only beneficiaries are likely to be those who call for “ Finlandization ” of the Korean peninsula .
meanwhile , the impact on German foreign policy of the country ’ s deepening economic ties with Russia has been evident throughout the Ukraine crisis . though Merkel frequently admonished the Kremlin about its intervention in Ukraine , German public opinion – particularly that of the country ’ s business leaders – tied her hands .
in Libya in 2011 , Germany refused to offer even rudimentary material support to the military intervention staged by its British and French allies . Germany has also continuously failed to meet its commitment to spend 2 % of its GDP on defense , at the same time that it has insisted that troubled EU economies stick to austerity budgets that limit their deficits to a fixed proportion of their economic output .
and German leaders ’ obsession with maintaining their country ’ s “ golden decade ” of exports appears to have gagged them on topics like China ’ s human rights abuses and its aggressive behavior toward its Asian neighbors . that silence is being rewarded with the first-ever joint cabinet sessions between a democracy and a communist dictatorship , which will take place in Berlin this autumn .
in both Germany and South Korea , economic strength seems to have produced an illusion of policy independence that is opening a chasm between the two countries and their allies – a chasm that revelations of US spying , on Merkel in particular , have deepened . Germany and South Korea , however , will gain little , and risk much , if they downgrade their alliance ties in favor of commercially motivated , if unofficial , neutrality .
ending East Asia ’ s History Wars
Tokyo – Georges Clemenceau , who , as France ’ s prime minister , led his country to victory in World War I , famously said that “ war is too important to be left to the generals . ” Japan is now discovering that history is too important to be left to newspaper editors .
that retraction appears to be causing as much embarrassment – and diplomatic vitriol – in Japan and South Korea today as the original series did . but , at a time when both countries cannot afford to permit partisan or sloppy abuses of history to roil their bilateral relations , Asahi ’ s careless work has turned out to be more than abysmal journalism ; it has introduced a dangerous element into regional diplomacy .
reconciling in the first two decades following the Nazi Occupation of France , these countries ’ leaders understood that their security and economic ties were far too important to their citizens ’ wellbeing to allow the old hatreds to fester . they knew that the unimaginable violence of WWII was a direct result of the antagonisms that had festered since the Napoleonic Wars and that were allowed to persist after 1918 .
of course , given that Japan and Korea have not fought a series of wars against each other , their relationship is not the same as that between Germany and France . but it is clear that no one will benefit from a new round of heated historical debate .
a recent Japanese government white paper called South Korea the country “ that shares the closest relationship with Japan historically and in areas such as economy and culture . ” No doubt , many , if not most , South Korean foreign-policy experts and strategists share that sentiment .
for too long , intemperate historical debates – often driven by biased newspaper accounts – have poisoned bilateral relations . now , as another war of words heats up , Japanese and South Korean leaders need to step back , recognize where the real interests of their people lie , both today and in the future , and calmly begin to take the measures required to ensure durable reconciliation .
taming the China Bears
Beijing – The market is always in search of a story , and investors , it seems , think they have found a new one this year in China . the country ’ s growth slowdown and mounting financial risks have spurred a growing wave of pessimism , with economists worldwide warning of an impending crash .
but dire predictions for China have abounded for the last 30 years , and not one has materialized . are today ’ s really so different ?
the short answer is no . like the predictions of the past , today ’ s warnings are based on historical precedents and universal indicators against which China , with its unique economic features , simply cannot be judged accurately .
the bottom line is that the complexity and distinctiveness of China ’ s economy mean that assessing its current state and performance requires a detail-oriented analysis that accounts for as many offsetting factors as possible . predictions are largely pointless , given that the assumptions underpinning them will invariably change .
consider China ’ s high leverage ratio , which many argue will be a key factor in causing a crisis . after all , they contend , developing countries that have experienced a large-scale credit boom have all ended up facing a credit crisis and a hard economic landing .
but several specific factors must be accounted for in assessing whether this is China ’ s fate . while China ’ s debt / GDP ratio is very high , the same is true in many successful East Asian economies , such as Taiwan , Singapore , South Korea , Thailand , and Malaysia .
in fact , China ’ s high debt / GDP ratio is , to a large extent , a result of its simultaneously high saving and investment rates . and , while the inability to repay loans can contribute to a high debt burden , the nonperforming-loan ( NPL ) ratio for China ’ s major banks stands at less than 1 % .
if , based on these considerations , one concludes that China ’ s debt / GDP ratio does constitute a substantial threat to its financial stability , there remains the question of whether a crisis is likely to occur . only when all of the specific linkages between a high debt burden and the onset of a financial crisis have been identified can one draw even a tentative conclusion about that .
China ’ s real-estate price bubble is often named as a likely catalyst for a crisis . but how such a downturn would unfold is far from certain .
given that property prices are unlikely to fall by such a large margin , the bubble ’ s collapse would not bring down China ’ s banks . even if real-estate prices fell by more than 50 % , commercial banks could survive – not least because mortgages account for only about 20 % of banks ’ total assets .
and China ’ s recently announced urbanization strategy should ensure that cities ’ demographic structure supports intrinsic demand . if that were not enough to ward off disaster , the government could purchase unsold properties and use them for social housing .
as a last resort , the government could step in , as it did in the late 1990 ’ s and early 2000 ’ s , to remove NPLs from banks ’ balance sheets . indeed , China has a massive war chest of foreign-exchange reserves that it would not hesitate to use to inject capital into commercial banks .
but the mismatch is less severe than some observers believe . in fact , the average term of deposits in China ’ s banks is about nine months , while medium- and long-term loans account for just over half of total outstanding credit .
if China eases restrictions on cross-border capital flows , an unexpected shock could trigger large-scale capital flight , bringing down the entire financial system . given this , it is vital that China maintains controls over short-term cross-border capital flows in the foreseeable future .
likewise , the Chinese government must address a fundamental contradiction . monetary interest rates have increased steadily , owing to rampant regulatory arbitrage ( whereby banks find loopholes that enable them to avoid unfavorable rules ) and the fragmentation of the credit market , while return on capital has fallen rapidly because of overcapacity .
if the Chinese government fails to reverse this trend , a financial crisis – in one form or another – will become inevitable . but , given the authorities ’ broad scope for policy intervention , the crash will not come anytime soon – if it comes at all .
the Long March from the Third Plenum
Beijing – Though China ’ s leadership succession was completed earlier this year , the policy agenda for the coming decade has only just been revealed . following Chinese political tradition , the country ’ s new leadership had to wait for the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party ’ s 18th Central Committee – held 3-4 quarters after the First Plenum , where the succession was sealed – to unveil its economic-policy priorities .
indeed , it was at the Third Plenum of the CCP ’ s 11th Central Committee that Deng Xiaoping launched the reforms that opened up the Chinese economy and triggered more than three decades of rapid economic growth . the Third Plenums of the CCP ’ s 14th and 16th Central Committees – held in 1993 and 2003 , respectively – also stand out .
the 60-point “ resolution ” produced at the most recent Third Plenum covers six areas : the economy , the political system , the environment , culture , society , and Party capacity-building . this represents a significant departure from the agendas produced at previous Third Plenums , which focused exclusively on economic reform .
but , when it comes to economic-reform objectives , the resolution is not overwhelmingly innovative . indeed , most of the goals that it includes – like reform of state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , development of private enterprise , reduction of government intervention , protection of property rights , and creation of a modern market system – can be found in the resolution of the Third Plenum of the CCP ’ s 16th Central Committee .
after all , the 2003 resolution had already defined the market as “ fundamental ” to resource allocation . given this , the latest resolution ’ s most important implication is that it has dispelled any doubt about the new leadership ’ s commitment to the market-oriented reform that Deng initiated in 1978 .
in line with tradition , the Third Plenum ’ s resolution did not discuss problems concerning growth and development , which one hopes the government will address in greater detail in the near future . that said , some of the resolution ’ s specific provisions for economic reform represent much-needed progress .
· SOEs will be required to deliver 30 % of their profits to the state , instead of keeping most – or even all – of their profits , as they have done for the last two decades .
· Farmers will be granted more property rights , allowing them , for example , to transfer and mortgage land-use rights , though the government understandably continues to exercise caution about rural-land privatization .
· A real-estate property tax will be introduced , in order to suppress skyrocketing housing prices and reduce the vacancy rate – a controversial but perhaps necessary move .
· The one-child policy will be eased , allowing a couple to have two children if one parent is an only child . ( whether this change will be enough to reverse problematic demographic trends remains a topic of heated debate . )
but emphasis seems to have shifted to encourage coordinated development between urban and rural areas . while rural migrant workers will be encouraged to settle in small and medium-size cities , migration to metropolises will remain tightly controlled – or even be more strictly regulated .
but the resolution ’ s genuinely groundbreaking objectives lie in other areas . for starters , the resolution includes two potentially game-changing legal reforms .
second , in order to strengthen judicial independence , the resolution includes a call “ to explore the establishment of judicial jurisdiction systems that are suitably separated from administrative areas . ” In other words , the courts should be able to make decisions independently of the local governments that finance them .
in the political realm , the resolution includes measures to strengthen China ’ s so-called “ consultative democracy . ” While the concept of enhancing the role of non-CCP forces in Chinese politics is not new , its prominence in the resolution reflects the Party ’ s willingness to adopt a more democratic political system – as long as it retains its dominant position , of course .
unfortunately , meritocracy has been eroded by a political culture of sycophancy and cynicism . designing a screening mechanism to minimize adverse selection in choosing bureaucrats and party officials has become one of the biggest challenges that China ’ s ruling elites confront .
although the resolution ’ s general message is encouraging , a shopping list of reform objectives is not a strategic analysis of the contradictions that are undermining China ’ s development , let alone an action plan for responding to these contradictions . indeed , for China ’ s new leadership , the successful completion of the Third Plenum is only the first step in a new long march toward a more stable , prosperous future .
China ’ s Trilemma
Beijing – The Nobel laureate economist Robert Mundell showed that an economy can maintain two – but only two – of three key features : monetary-policy independence , a fixed exchange rate , and free cross-border capital flows . but China is currently juggling all three – an act that is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain .
given that the People ’ s Bank of China ( PBOC ) has largely maintained its monetary-policy independence over the last three decades , and actively manages the renminbi ’ s exchange rate , it is natural to conclude that China imposes strict controls on capital flows . in fact , China liberalized inward foreign direct investment more than 20 years ago , and eased controls for much of the capital account thereafter .
in the early 2000s , short-term capital began to flow into China , with investors betting on the renminbi ’ s appreciation and , from 2004-2006 , on rising asset prices . since renminbi internationalization was launched in 2009 , exchange-rate arbitrage and the carry trade have surged .
certainly , China ’ s capital controls , though porous , increase the transaction costs of moving short-term capital to and from China , thereby reducing upward pressure on the renminbi ’ s exchange rate ; in extreme circumstances , this could play a decisive role in China ’ s financial security . but capital continues to flow – if not entirely freely – across China ’ s borders .
this raises an obvious question : how has China managed to defy the Mundell trilemma by maintaining all three policy objectives simultaneously ? the answer lies in China ’ s sterilization policy .
China has run a capital-account surplus for most of the last 30 years , and a trade surplus every year since 1993 . the PBOC keeps the exchange rate stable by intervening heavily in the foreign-exchange market , creating so much liquidity that the authorities must engage in massive sterilization to avoid overshooting the targeted increase in the monetary base .
in China , unlike in advanced countries , monetary and sterilization policy are often one in the same . the degree to which monetary policy is expansionary depends on the degree to which the liquidity created by currency-market intervention has been sterilized .
the most frequently used monetary instrument in sterilization is open-market operations . given China ’ s twin surpluses , the PBOC sold all of the government bonds that it had accumulated in 2003 , so it has been selling central-bank bills ever since , with CN ¥ 5 trillion ( $ 812 billion ) in such bills currently held by banks .
another important instrument for sterilization is the reserve-requirement ratio , which , when raised , locks a large amount of liquidity in the banking system . the ratio , which the PBOC has changed 42 times since 1998 , currently stands at 20 % – double the ratio for large banks in the United States .
for starters , by maintaining an undervalued real exchange rate , China has fallen into the so-called “ dollar trap , ” boosting the US dollar ’ s international importance at China ’ s own expense . as time passes , the senselessness of this policy will become increasingly apparent .
a less noticed form of resource misallocation stems from the fact that only sellers of foreign exchange gain liquidity , but the whole economy feels the effects . as a result , small and medium-size enterprises that produce non-tradable products are denied much-needed funds and suffer from sterilization ’ s negative externalities .
furthermore , the high reserve ratio and forced purchase of central-bank bills squeezes commercial banks ’ profits severely – a phenomenon that will be intensified by interest-rate liberalization . the quest for yield on available funds will drive banks to make riskier investments .
there are also quasi-fiscal costs involved . fortunately , despite the low returns on foreign assets , this is not yet a major problem for China , owing to the low costs of the corresponding PBOC liabilities .
China ’ s Investment Addiction
Beijing – China ’ s economy slowed unexpectedly in the second quarter of this year . just as unexpectedly , most data released since July suggest that China ’ s growth has stabilized .
currently , the most severe problem confronting Chinese authorities is overcapacity . for example , China ’ s annual production capacity for crude steel is one billion tons , but its total output in 2012 was 720 million tons – a capacity utilization rate of 72 % .
some say that today ’ s overcapacity is a result of China ’ s past overinvestment . others attribute it to a lack of effective demand .
on one hand , the authorities have ordered thousands of companies to reduce capacity . on the other hand , the government has introduced some “ mini-stimulus ” measures , ranging from exemptions for “ micro firms ” from business and sales taxes to pressure on banks to increase loans to exporters .
but not all Chinese economists agree . they argue that capital stock is the key factor for growth , and that China ’ s per capita capital stock is still low relative to developed countries , which implies considerable scope for further investment .
to be sure , capital accumulation is a driving force of economic growth , and catching up with developed-country income levels implies that China must increase its capital stock in the long run . but what is at issue is not the size of the capital stock , or even the level of investment ; the problem is the growth rate of investment , which has been significantly higher than that of GDP for decades .
given absorption constraints , capital efficiency has been falling steadily amid increasing deadweight . if environmental damage caused by breakneck investment growth were taken into account , China ’ s capital efficiency would be even lower .
if resource allocation is skewed toward physical capital at the expense of accumulating human capital – for which adequate consumption is indispensable – economic growth would be more likely to slow than rise . so China should reduce the growth rate of investment and increase that of consumption , allowing the investment rate to settle at a more sustainable level .
of course , it is not entirely untrue that China ’ s overcapacity reflects a shortfall of effective demand . but where can effective demand come from ?
despite China ’ s lack of a comparative advantage for steel production , it has built approximately one thousand mills , with output accounting for roughly half of the global total . as early as 2004 , China ’ s government tried to clamp down on overinvestment ; and yet output increased dramatically , from 300 million tons that year to a billion tons in 2012 , owing to strong demand generated by investment in infrastructure and real-estate development .
China ’ s investment consists of mainly three broad categories : manufacturing industry , infrastructure , and real estate . in late 2008 and 2009 , at the height of the global financial crisis , stimulus-fueled infrastructure investment sustained output growth .
but the pace of investment must take financial constraints fully into consideration . more important , China can and should invest more in social infrastructure such as schools , hospitals , retirement homes , and so on .
it is difficult to judge how serious China ’ s property bubble is and when it might burst . but one thing is certain : China has invested too much in real-estate development .
with per capita income at less than $ 6,000 , homeownership in China is roughly 90 % , compared to less than 70 % in the United States . average floor space per capita is 32.9 square meters , while median floor space per family in Hong Kong is just 48 square meters .
on one hand , China should not try to eliminate overcapacity by maintaining the high growth rate of real-estate investment . while investment in social housing should be welcomed , real-estate investment , currently running at 10-13 % of GDP , is already far too high .
this indicates that data on the growth rate of fixed-asset investment may have exaggerated the pace of capital-stock accumulation . hence , while the Chinese government should be firm on reducing the dependence of growth on investment , it must exercise utmost care when doing so .
China ’ s Fire Next Time
Beijing – Earlier this year , rumors of China ’ s impending financial doom – triggered by either a housing-market crash or local-government debt defaults – were rampant . but , in recent months , the economy has stabilized , leaving few doubts about China ’ s ability to grow by more than 7 % this year .
the fundamental problems that triggered alarm bells in the first place – including real-estate bubbles , local-government debt , rapid growth in shadow-banking activity , and rising corporate leverage ratios – remain unresolved . of these , the most immediate threat to China ’ s economic and financial stability is the combination of high borrowing costs , low profitability for nonfinancial corporations , and very high corporate leverage ratios .
according to a study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , the debt / GDP ratio for China ’ s nonfinancial corporations was 113 % by the end of 2012 . standard &amp; amp ;
poor ’ s found that , a year later , these firms ’ total debt amounted to $ 14.2 trillion , eclipsing the $ 13.1 trillion of outstanding debt in the United States and making China the world ’ s largest issuer of corporate debt .
there is no indication that the ratio will decline anytime soon , which is particularly worrisome , given the low profitability and high borrowing costs that China ’ s industrial enterprises face . indeed , Chinese firms ’ profitability amounted to just over 6 % last year , with 2012 profits for China ’ s 500 largest ( mostly state-owned ) corporations barely exceeding 2 % .
meanwhile , interest rates on bank loans to nonfinancial enterprises remain close to 7 % , despite having fallen slightly over the last year . and , in the second quarter of this year , the annualized interest rate on loans to small nonfinancial corporations surpassed 25 % .
with insufficient profits to use for investment , nonfinancial corporations will become increasingly dependent on external finance . as their leverage ratios increase , so will their risk premiums , causing their borrowing costs to rise and undermining their profitability further .
to be sure , China overcame a similar challenge in its public sector from 1998 to 2001 . it pursued growth-boosting investment in infrastructure and real-estate development to eliminate deflation , while maintaining artificially low interest rates to contain the rise of public debt .
in fact , the investment-led growth model that facilitated double-digit growth in the decade after 2001 has exacerbated structural weaknesses , which must now be addressed . indeed , China must stem the pace of real-estate investment , which accounted for more than 13 % of GDP in recent years – a move that will undoubtedly lead to slower economic growth and , in turn , reduce the profitability of China ’ s nonfinancial corporates further .
moreover , ongoing interest-rate liberalization – which has occurred both openly and surreptitiously – means that artificially low borrowing costs have become far more difficult to maintain . though the People ’ s Bank of China still officially caps interest rates on deposits , commercial banks – in cooperation with nonbank financial institutions , especially trust companies – are using wealth-management products to attract deposits with de facto free-market interest rates .
in 1996 , when Japan ’ s public debt / GDP ratio reached 80 % , many Japanese economists and officials worried about a looming crisis . almost two decades later , the ratio has surpassed 200 % – and still no crisis has erupted .
furthermore , China has not yet completed its market-orientated reforms , which could unleash major growth potential in many areas . given the role that institutional factors play in China ’ s corporate-debt problem , such reforms could go a long way toward resolving it .
China ’ s leaders should take advantage of this respite from instability and low confidence to redouble their reform efforts . otherwise , they can expect alarm bells to begin ringing again – and , next time , they may not have the tools they need to silence them .
the Enigma of European Defense
Paris – While Europe ’ s citizens largely support the establishment of a common security and defense policy , most European leaders have demonstrated a clear lack of interest in creating one – including at last month ’ s European Council meeting . what accounts for this paradox ?
in fact , it could be argued that such constraints should spur , not impede , the creation of a European defense structure . after all , member countries would then be able to pool their resources , harmonize programs , and rationalize costs , thereby reducing individual governments ’ financial burden .
another , far more credible explanation is that Europeans ’ interpretations of “ a more active and stronger security policy ” differ widely . indeed , current discussions in Europe concerning the use of force are dominated by three main perspectives , championed by France , the United Kingdom , and Germany .
France , which has once again intervened in Africa – this time to restore order in the Central African Republic – is the only European Union country that seems genuinely interested in satisfying popular demand for more robust European security structures . the French consider Europe to be a kind of superpower – a status that implies a corresponding military capacity .
while this view probably stems from France ’ s historical political and military prowess , it also reflects the country ’ s current interests . as Europe ’ s greatest military power ( despite the UK ’ s larger defense budget ) , France would play a key role in any wide-ranging European military operation .
it claims that its opposition to a European defense structure stems from its belief that NATO – and thus the United States – is critical to European defense . but , given that no other EU country has seriously considered excluding NATO , this argument seems to be little more than an excuse .
in the UK ’ s view , “ European ” operations should be limited to humanitarian and peacekeeping objectives . while it supported the fight against piracy off the Horn of Africa , that was more a policing operation than a military one , and it was guided by a shared interest in protecting trade routes from the Middle East and Asia .
unlike the UK , Germany supports a European security and defense policy , proudly highlighting its consistent military budget and major presence in European missions ( larger than that of the overstretched French ) . and , though Germany shares the UK ’ s belief that NATO bears primary responsibility for protecting Europe , its view of European engagement is even more restrictive .
in fact , a majority of Europe ’ s citizens prefer that European forces be deployed only for non-combat missions . and , so far , virtually all European military operations have been aimed at evacuating European nationals , delivering humanitarian aid , or maintaining peace in the aftermath of conflict .
these differing views explain the uncertainty surrounding France ’ s recent interventions in Africa . the French have lamented the miniscule support offered by the rest of Europe for its operations in Mali and the Central African Republic – exemplified by Germany ’ s refusal to create a fund for EU member-state operations .
but , given the urgency of the situations in Libya , Mali , and the Central African Republic , this lack of support has not undermined France ’ s efforts as much as prior consultation with European leaders would have done . had the Germans been consulted , they probably would have rejected the interventions anyway .
this conflict between the need for rapid response and the requirement for deliberation explains why the EU ’ s much-discussed “ battlegroups ” are unlikely ever to be deployed . the fact that most Europeans are satisfied with limited political and military involvement outside of Europe makes increased defense cooperation even less likely .
a pessimist would say that Europeans are unable – or at least unwilling – to rethink their defense policy , because the US ultimately ensures their security through NATO . according to this view , France ’ s efforts to encourage both transatlantic integration and autonomous political action are insufficient to change most Europeans ’ minds .
a more optimistic interpretation is that Europe needs defense structures that account for the role of member states – not just for that of the EU . from this perspective , Europe does have a significant military presence , whether in Afghanistan and Libya or Mali and the Central African Republic .
Zimbabwe \ u0027s Last Chance
as the world rooted for former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan in his recent efforts to end the violence in Kenya , many also found themselves wondering whether a weary Annan , or some other global leader , will be battling another fire by the end of this month : this time in Zimbabwe .
Zimbabwe ’ s upcoming elections , scheduled for March 29 , offer both fear and hope to the millions trapped in or trying to escape the country ’ s hellish conditions . even official data now put the inflation rate at more than 100,000 % , and the plight of ordinary Zimbabweans grows more desperate by the day .
torture is widespread . civil society groups report the arrests of opposition electoral candidates , the manipulation of food supplies for political purposes , and violent incidents of voter intimidation .
the Zimbabwe Election Support Network has also expressed concern about the country ’ s state of readiness for this complex election , which will combine presidential , parliamentary , senatorial , and local government contests . and this is to say nothing of the structural faults that continue to impede political progress – a defective constitution , censored media , and a partisan security and military establishment .
South African president Thabo Mbeki convened negotiations with Zimbabwe ’ s political groups ; but they have been so unfruitful that opposition leaders recently all but accused Mbeki of lying to the world about the progress of the talks . some African leaders – notably Ghana ’ s president , John Kufuor , and outgoing African Union head Alpha Konare – have tried to cajole Mugabe towards reform , to no avail .
perhaps more significantly , the international community ’ s failure to address Zimbabwe seriously shows , once again , that it lacks the political will to prevent foreseeable crises . last year , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour condemned the regime ’ s use of torture and its mistreatment of pro-democracy forces .
the UN would say it must be invited into a country before it can take certain forms of action , such as sending official election observers . but it is also true that with adequate political will , the UN Security Council could live up to its responsibility to Zimbabweans by responding to the crisis more aggressively .
the UN should have put Mugabe on the defensive with a forceful public offer to help Zimbabwe prepare for internationally supervised elections . instead , the UN continues to defer to Mugabe , who hides behind claims of sovereignty while jailing a defenseless populace .
with so many lives at stake , what can be done to avert an intensification of the Zimbabwe crisis ?
people of good will throughout the world , including those affiliated with multilateral organizations like the UN , should descend on Zimbabwe to observe this month ’ s elections . accredited or not , they should stand in solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe at this crucial moment , act as witnesses to the deteriorating pre-election environment , and serve as a bulwark against any escalation of state brutality during and after the vote .
Mugabe would prefer to limit the presence of international observers to those sent by neighboring states – the same allies that somehow managed to deem the violent and fraudulent elections of the past seven years “ legitimate . ” Zimbabwe ’ s neighbors also face a choice : they can use their proximity to halt Mugabe ’ s abuses , or to shield him from international scrutiny and rebuke .
the people of Zimbabwe will play their part on March 29 . as for the regional and world community , their actions today and in the coming weeks could make the difference between a reprise of the violence in Kenya and the first step towards a more stable and democratic future .
Zimbabwe ’ s Permanent Guantánamo
habeas corpus , Latin for “ you have the body , ” is an old English common law principle incorporated into the US Constitution to ensure freedom from unlawful detention by the state . it was and continues to be a critical check against the imprisonment of individuals without oversight by independent courts .
just hours before the US Supreme Court ruling , Tendai Biti , the Secretary-General of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , was arrested upon his return to Zimbabwe . despite immediate attempts by his lawyers to locate him , his whereabouts remained unknown for days .
in the most recent elections , Zimbabweans made their choice known , despite serious obstacles and widespread repression , with the MDC ’ s presidential candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , gaining more votes than Mugabe . but , according to the vote counts released by the government after a suspicious month-long delay , the MDC ’ s margin of victory – 48 % to 43 % – fell short of the 50 % required to avoid a run-off election .
over the past two years , police and government-supported paramilitaries have routinely jailed , beaten , and even killed MDC officials and suspected MDC members . last year , Biti was detained and beaten along with Tsvangirai and dozens of other MDC officials .
state-sponsored violence against the MDC and its supporters has escalated as the June 27 run-off vote draws near . just weeks ago , Biti described the discovery of the mutilated body of Tonderai Ndira , an MDC youth leader . Ndira had been taken by the police from his home .
here in our offices in Johannesburg , we have two Zimbabwean lawyers who fled their country after receiving death threats for their work defending human rights . at least five of their clients have been murdered in the past few weeks .
it is hard to imagine that a free and fair election can take place against the backdrop of such intense and systemic violence . indeed , even South African president Thabo Mbeki , who , despite an outcry from many of his citizens , has supported Mugabe , felt compelled to label it a “ cause for serious concern . ”
it is time for the international community to step in , call for an end to the detention and disappearance of MDC officials and perceived supporters , and push for a democratic transition in Zimbabwe . only then can the principles underlying the Supreme Court ’ s decision come within reach of ordinary Zimbabweans .
Zoellick to the Rescue ?
will newly anointed World Bank President Robert Zoellick be able to get the organization back on its feet after the catastrophic failed presidency of Paul Wolfowitz ? although hardly a megawatt star of the Bob Rubin category , he certainly brings some positive attributes to the job .
second , he is a firm believer in the power of markets and free trade , which have clearly done far more to alleviate poverty over the past half-century than any aid program . third , he seems to have been a consistent behind-the-scenes supporter of the Bank , whereas many of his Bush administration colleagues would be just as happy to see it shut down and its Washington headquarters turned into private condominiums and offices .
first and foremost , his appointment extends the embarrassingly outmoded practice of always installing an American in the job . with the Bank tirelessly preaching the merits of good governance , its failure to adopt democratic principles undercuts its own legitimacy .
the Bank ’ s most important role in development today is as a “ knowledge bank ” that helps aggregate , distill , and disseminate best practices from around the world . in this respect , the Bank ’ s technical assistance to governments is very similar to what private consultants offer to companies .
moreover , many of the World Bank president ’ s most important decisions involve economics in an essential way . wrong economic decisions , such as in the 1970 ’ s , when Robert McNamara pushed grandiose , but environmentally devastating , infrastructure projects , have haunted the Bank for decades .
reform number one , of course , is to ensure that the next World Bank President is not an American . Rodrigo de Rato , Zoellick ’ s counterpart at the European-dominated International Monetary Fund , has already suggested that his successor should be chosen in a more inclusive process .
second , Zoellick should ask why the Bank spends only 2.5 % of its budget on the “ knowledge bank ” research function that it trumpets so proudly in its external relations materials , while it spends three times that amount on maintaining its executive board .
third , Zoellick should use his formidable negotiating skills to cajole rich countries into greatly increasing the grant component of World Bank aid . the idea that a big government-guaranteed global bank is needed to fill holes in private capital markets is laughable nowadays .
a lot of technical advice falls on deaf ears , with countries listening only long enough to get their hands on Bank money . instead of merely pushing its agenda , the Bank should start charging for its technical advice on a graduated scale so that more of its engagements are client-driven .
last but not least , the Bank needs to play a much bigger role in environmental issues and , in general , in promoting good international citizenship by both rich and poor countries . ( some of us have been proposing this for almost two decades . )
of course , Zoellick could just attempt to fill the role symbolically and do little or nothing , as some of his predecessors have done . or , less likely , he could embrace some megalomaniacal and over-reaching vision of government intervention , as others have tried .
Zuma Rising
the anxiety over Jacob Zuma ’ s election as president of South Africa obscures a significant milestone : for the first time in decades , a sub-Saharan nation has at its helm a champion of ordinary people .
he ’ s secure enough to dance and sing in public . he speaks the language of populism , raising hopes for the vast majority of South Africans who daily endure the misery of poor housing , schools , and health care .
Zuma , who spent his youth herding cattle and only gained formal education while in the notorious Robben Island prison with Mandela , is refreshingly aware that Africa ’ s biggest problem is its inequalities , not its global marginalization . in Africa ’ s wealthiest nation – but also the nation where wealth is most unequally shared – a bold populist now holds ultimate power over government policy .
yet , while Zuma ’ s populist appeal reflects South Africa ’ s especially large differences in economic class , the threat of imposing higher taxes and other obligations on employers and the wealthy has raised fears at home and internationally . moreover , Zuma has been called a chameleon , accused of telling his audiences what they want to hear .
Zuma ’ s turbulent personal life – many wives and his embarrassing contention during a rape trial that he avoided HIV infection by taking a shower – has invited ridicule . most seriously , doubts persist about his commitment to democracy , with critics arguing he ’ s an old-style African “ big man ” ready to bully opponents and ravage the public coffers with his cronies .
South Africa has the continent ’ s largest economy and , until the global financial crisis , posted 10 years of steady economic growth . in an economic slowdown , the country ’ s severe crime problem might only worsen ; so might unemployment , which already tops 20 % in the formal economy .
Zuma senses the urgency of the situation . he is , after all , 67 years old and likely to serve only a single term in office .
he is part of the proud generation that defeated apartheid – and then peacefully engineered a transition to durable black-majority rule . their achievement remains one of the greatest in recent history .
at the same time , Zuma ’ s revolutionary generation still seems uneasy leading South Africa in a post-apartheid era that is now 15 years old . in a region that reveres the elderly , Zuma ’ s attachment to his rural traditions must be matched by an equal openness to the appetites of the country ’ s youth .
three in ten South Africans are younger than 15 , meaning that they did not live a day under apartheid . somehow Zuma must find a way to honor his own generation ’ s commitment to racial justice and national liberation , while empowering the masses who daily suffer the sting of class differences and yearn for material gain .
