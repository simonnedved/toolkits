learning the lessons of the decision to invade Iraq , democracies should not allow personal obsessions , fantasies , and dogmas to contaminate the foreign policy-making process . it is essential to distinguish between what we know , what we ought to know – and what , therefore , we would like the Iranians to tell us – and what is speculation .
second , as long as a serious breach of international law is not detected , negotiations with Iran must continue . Iran is a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has repeatedly declared that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only .
while an end to all contacts would probably lead to further radicalization , negotiations and the mere prospect of a future settlement may reinforce the influence of moderates . with historical perspective , lack of proper negotiations has been counterproductive in the North Korean case .
third , sanctions should not be discarded , but they should be interpreted as a means of pressure rather than as a mere prelude to war . as Javier Solana , the European Union ’ s chief diplomat , who has conducted lengthy negotiations with Iran , rightly points out , even if the United Nations Security Council approves sanctions against Iran , the door to negotiations will always be open .
finally , dealing with the Middle East , not just with Iran , requires a fresh , open-minded , and comprehensive approach . all regional and local actors should be involved .
true , if one has a hammer , all problems look like nails . the real trouble begins when one thinks that the hammer might be the right solution for headaches , too .
big Banks ’ Tall Tales
Washington , DC – There are two competing narratives about recent financial-reform efforts and the dangers that very large banks now pose around the world . one narrative is wrong ; the other is scary .
new rules limiting the scope of bank activities are in place in the United States , and soon will become law in the United Kingdom – and continental Europe could follow suit . proponents of this view also claim that the megabanks are managing risk better than they did before the global financial crisis erupted in 2008 .
in the second narrative , the world ’ s largest banks remain too big to manage and have strong incentives to engage in precisely the kind of excessive risk-taking that can bring down economies . last year ’ s “ London Whale ” trading losses at JPMorgan Chase are a case in point .
ask this question : if a humongous financial institution gets into trouble , is this a big deal for economic growth , unemployment , and the like ? or , more bluntly , could Citigroup or a similar-size European firm get into trouble and stumble again toward failure without attracting some form of government and central bank support ( whether transparent or somewhat disguised ) ?
the US took a step in the right direction with Title II of the Dodd-Frank reform legislation in 2010 , which strengthened the resolution powers of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . &amp; # 160 ; And the FDIC has developed some plausible plans specifically for dealing with domestic financial firms .
the reason is simple : US law can create a resolution authority that works only within national boundaries . addressing potential failure at a firm like Citigroup would require a cross-border agreement between governments and all responsible agencies .
on the fringes of the International Monetary Fund ’ s just-completed spring meetings in Washington , DC , I had the opportunity to talk with senior officials and their advisers from various countries , including from Europe . I asked all of them the same question : when will we have a binding framework for cross-border resolution ?
governments want the ability to decide how best to protect their countries ’ perceived national interests when a crisis strikes . no one is willing to sign a treaty or otherwise pre-commit in a binding way ( least of all a majority of the US Senate , which must ratify such a treaty ) .
as Bill Dudley , the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank , put it recently , using the delicate language of central bankers , “ The impediments to an orderly cross-border resolution still need to be fully identified and dismantled . this is necessary to eliminate the so-called ‘ too big to fail ’ problem . ”
as long as we allow cross-border banks at or close to their current scale , our political leaders will be unable to tolerate their failure . and , because these large financial institutions are by any meaningful definition “ too big to fail , ” they can borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case .
it is a bizarre form of subsidy , to be sure , but that does not make it any less damaging to the public interest . on the contrary , because implicit government support for “ too big to fail ” banks rises with the amount of risk that they assume , this support may be among the most dangerous subsidies that the world has ever seen .
what other part of the corporate world has the ability to drive the global economy into recession , as banks did in the fall of 2008 ? and who else has an incentive to maximize the amount of debt that they issue ?
what the two narratives about financial reform have in common is that neither has a happy ending . either we put a meaningful cap on the size of our largest financial firms , or we must brace ourselves for the debt-fueled economic explosion to come .
the Phantom Middle East Peace Process
Tel AVIV – Twenty years after the Madrid Peace conference , and ten years after President Bill Clinton ’ s heroic efforts at Camp David failed to yield a settlement between Israelis and Palestinians , one cannot escape the conclusion that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has become one of the most spectacular deceptions in modern diplomatic history .
the process fell victim to the parties ’ inability to bridge the gap between what was politically feasible for them and what was required for a settlement . trapped between the possible and the necessary , Israelis and Palestinians simply learned to live without a solution .
however obsessed international opinion may be with Gaza ’ s agony , to most Israelis the Palestinian “ problem ” seems to be happening on the dark side of the moon . the wall / fence in the West Bank and Ariel Sharon ’ s disengagement from Gaza have practically done away with daily friction between Jews an Arabs .
when asked in November 1970 to spell out his views of a possible peace deal with the Palestinians , Dayan ’ s answer was one that could easily be endorsed by most of the ministers in Binyamin Netanyahu ’ s government . Dayan said : “ The only peace negotiations are those where we settle the land and we build , and we settle , and from time to time we go to war . ”
with peace plans and envoys coming and going , Israelis and Palestinians alike have finally become blasé about the chances of a final settlement . the two-state solution is rapidly losing its appeal .
for , if a two-state solution really is the future , a social and political earthquake of untold dimensions awaits Israelis : a massive evacuation of settlers and a desperate need for a difficult political realignment to deal with the threat of civil strife and perhaps even military disobedience . all this in order to go back to the 1967 borders , for which few Israelis feel nostalgic .
true , Hamas has been indicating recently a readiness to contemplate a solution based on the 1967 borders , but it is doubtful that its leaders and members could live with the betrayal of the refugees . then again , the idea of Palestinian statehood is not central to Hamas ’ s worldview , in which the strategic objective is the ultimate victory of Islam .
Jordanians of the caliber of Former Prime Ministers Abdelsalam Al-Majali and Taher al-Masri , as well as a former adviser of King Hussein , Adnan Abu-Odeh , have been advancing schemes for a Jordanian-Palestinian solution . their argument is essentially that the peace process ’ s troubles stem from its deviation from the original intention of the architects of the Madrid Peace Conference , where a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation sat representing the two peoples .
as always , they want the best of all worlds : an emphatically Jewish state in which Palestinians would have citizenship rights , but no national rights whatsoever . that is not a bad formula for a state of permanent civil war .
trapped in their contradictions and zero-sum national dreams , Israelis and Palestinians cannot expect a perfect solution . their task is to embrace the least imperfect solution before they decline into Doomsday scenarios , such as a hostile Israeli unilateral disengagement , or a one-state reality of unending conflict .
the Phelps Factor
the award was long overdue . while the Nobel Prize committee cited his contributions to macroeconomics , Phelps has made contributions in many areas , including the theory of growth and technological change , optimal taxation , and social justice .
Phelps ’ key observation in macroeconomics was that the relationship between inflation and unemployment is affected by expectations , and since expectations themselves are endogenous – they change over time – so , too , will the relationship between unemployment and inflation . if a government attempts to push the unemployment rate too low , inflation will increase , and so , too , will inflationary expectations .
some policymakers have concluded from Phelps ’ analysis that the unemployment rate cannot be lowered permanently without ever-increasing levels of inflation . thus , monetary authorities should simply focus on price stability by targeting the rate of unemployment at which inflation does not increase , referred to as the “ non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment ” ( NAIRU ) .
but the NAIRU is not immutable . the correct implication , which Phelps repeatedly emphasized , is that governments can implement a variety of policies , particularly structural policies , to allow the economy to operate at a lower level of unemployment .
as a practical matter , even controlling for expectations ( as Phelps ’ work insists that we do ) , the relationship between unemployment and inflation is highly unstable . it is virtually impossible to discern the relationship from the data except in a few isolated periods .
but , whatever the reason , policymakers face considerable uncertainty about the level of NAIRU . thus , they still face a trade-off between pushing unemployment too low , and setting off an episode of inflation , and not pushing hard enough , resulting in an unnecessary waste of economic resources .
how one views these risks depends on the costs of undoing mistakes , which in turn depends on other properties of the inflation-unemployment relationship that Phelps ’ analysis did not address . the weight of evidence indicates that the cost of undoing the mistake of pushing unemployment down too far is itself very low , at least for countries like the US , where the relationship has been carefully studied .
in the early 1990 ’ s , the Fed , and many others , thought that the NAIRU was around 6 % -6.2 % . based on changes in the economy , I and the staff that worked with me on President Bill Clinton ’ s Council of Economic Advisers argued that the NAIRU was considerably lower .
this matters because , as the great economist Arthur Okun argued , reducing unemployment by two percentage points would increase output by 2 % -6 % , or $ 0.5-1.5 trillion dollars in the case of America . even for a rich country , that is a lot of money .
Phelps ’ work helped us to understand the complexity of the relationship between inflation and unemployment , and the important role that expectations can play in that relationship . but it is a misuse of that analysis to conclude that nothing can be done about unemployment , or that monetary authorities should focus exclusively on inflation .
he has tried to understand what we can do to lower unemployment and increase the well-being of those at the bottom . but he has also striven to understand what makes capitalist economies dynamic , what lies behind the entrepreneurial spirit , and what we can do to promote it further .
the Philippines Joins the Asian Race
Manila – In 1980 , my father arrived in the United States to undergo a heart bypass , due to the rigors of his imprisonment by the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos . the dictatorship offered him a reprieve , but , true to its nature , one dependent on its whims .
three years later , my father went home , not to die , but to infuse new life into the demoralized ranks of the opposition to the dictatorship . his assassination upon his arrival at Manila airport became the ultimate proof of the sincerity of what he had proclaimed throughout his life .
in 1986 , my countrymen peacefully defied Marcos ’ s tanks and demonstrated their faith in themselves . Marcos fled , and democracy was restored without bloodshed .
my mother , who then became President , also had an enduring message : the democracy that we had regained at such a high price could be ensured only by a vigorous commitment to making its institutions work .
this massive expression of solidarity evolved into an effort to draft me to run for the presidency in 2010 . at the polls , my countrymen conferred a solemn mandate on me to make democracy the means for eliminating corruption and alleviating poverty .
our administration is committed to transforming a country where nice guys finish last into one where those who deviate from the straight and narrow face punishment for their crimes . our goal is to empower citizens to demand the rule of law , regardless of who is in power .
within a year of taking office , my predecessor increased the NFA ’ s debt to 18 billion pesos . in the course of the next eight and a half years , her administration imported much more rice than was needed , resulting in 177 billion pesos in debt by the time she stepped down .
in a shift from the illogical import policy of the past , we focused our energies on revitalizing rural irrigation , which boosted the first dry-season crop yields . this year , our government will import 64 % less rice than in 2010 .
without food security , individuals can have no chance of achieving social mobility . that is why we are investing in our fellow citizens by means of a conditional cash-transfer program , called Pantawid Pamilya in Tagalog , which is patterned after Brazil ’ s Bolsa Familia .
we are also providing cash assistance to eligible poor families on the condition that pregnant mothers and children avail themselves of preventive health care , and that children regularly attend school . this program already covers roughly 2.3 million poor families , providing them with yet another key to social mobility .
one agency where large-scale graft and corruption was traditionally rampant was the Department of Public Works and Highways . by instituting open , competitive , and transparent bidding , the department has saved 2.5 billion pesos from 3,692 projects nationwide in the past year .
it allows the public to report tax cheats , smugglers , and crooks anonymously . the government likewise subjects officials to lifestyle checks and vets their statements of assets and liabilities to find out if what they have acquired is commensurate with their declared income .
these campaigns are yielding results . Sixty-seven tax-evasion cases and 43 smuggling cases , with claims totaling more than 26 billion pesos and 58 billion pesos , respectively , have been filed against groups and individuals .
we must also attract foreign investment , despite the difficulties facing Europe , the US , and Japan . our economic diplomacy has three key objectives , one of which is to secure more markets for our exports and enticing more tourists to visit the country .
our diplomacy is also focused on protecting the well-being of the roughly ten million Filipinos working overseas . but attracting investment to create jobs at home and ease poverty is the best way to ensure that our countrymen are not forced to go overseas in the first place .
our Business Process Outsourcing industry is now the second largest in the world , behind India , with revenues of $ 8.9 billion in 2010 rising to a projected $ 11 billion in 2011 . the Philippines also ranks fourth in the world in terms of shipbuilding .
our sound fiscal management has been widely recognized , with all of the major credit ratings agencies upgrading the Philippines within our government ’ s first year . and the World Economic Forum ranked us 75th in its latest Global Competitiveness Report – a ten-spot jump from last year , and the Philippines ’ highest ranking since it entered the survey .
the Philippines reopened for business under new management only a little more than a year ago . it is faring very well – and is set to become increasingly profitable .
the Poetry of the Euro
Princeton – The purpose of creating a common currency has been largely and surprisingly forgotten in crisis-torn Europe . instead , there seem to be more pressing concerns : gloomy speculation about the eurozone ’ s impending collapse and desperate attempts to find institutional fixes to its extensive governance problems .
the bold European experiment reflected a new attitude about what money should do , as well as how it should be managed . in opting for a “ pure ” form of money , created by a central bank independent of national authority , Europeans self-consciously flew in the face of what had become the dominant monetary tradition . &amp; # 160 ;
this tradition went back well before paper , or fiat , currencies . for many centuries , even while metallic money circulated , the task of defining units of account – livres tournois , marks , gulden , florins , or dollars – remained a task of the state ( or of those with political power ) .
abuse of this role , with governments addressing excessive debt by inflating it away , was deeply destructive of political order in the first half of the twentieth century . after World War II , the liberal politicians most committed to European federalism saw this point clearly .
but monetary abuse is no less dangerous in political systems with multi-layered authority , and in the past often led to the breakup of federal states . that is because inflation is not a benign cure for economic ills , in which beneficent and stimulatory effects are spread equally over the entire region under the inflationary monetary authority .
those industries , banks , and political authorities that are not so privileged are inevitably resentful , and view the central bank ’ s actions as an abuse of power . in federal systems , in particular , those businesses and political authorities far removed from the center are most likely to be excluded from the monetary stimulus and hence are inclined to be resentful .
hyperinflation in Germany in the 1920 ’ s fanned separatism in Bavaria , the Rhineland , and Saxony , because these remote areas thought that Germany ’ s central bank and central government in Berlin were discriminating against them . the separatists were politically radical – on the left in Saxony , and on the far right in Bavaria and the Rhineland .
in late-1980 ’ s Yugoslavia , as the socialist regime disintegrated , the monetary authorities in Belgrade were inevitably closest to Serbian politicians such as Slobodan Milošević and to Serbian business interests . as a result , the Croats and Slovenes wanted out of the federation .
the makers of modern Europe saw that unstable and politically abused money would be a European nightmare , and lead to destructive national animosities and antagonisms . they were supported by the twentieth century ’ s two most influential economists , Friedrich von Hayek and John Maynard Keynes .
his proposal , competitive currencies produced by “ free banking ” in which numerous private authorities would issue their own money , was more radical than the solution adopted by Europeans in the 1990 ’ s . but the Hayekian element of a money-issuing authority that was extensively protected against political pressures , and consequently against political opprobrium , was a key part of the European Union ’ s Maastricht Treaty .
the vision of central-bank independence as a necessary part of the constitution of a sound and stable political order was not simply a European construct in the 1990 ’ s . it was also reflected in legislative changes affecting other central banks , and in central bankers ’ growing prestige .
in the aftermath of the worst financial crisis since WWII , central banks are once again being called on to monetize securities issued by some debtors , but not others . that task of selecting between debtors is highly political , and poisons the idea of monetary stability .
Jean-Claude Trichet , until recently the president of the European Central Bank , liked to claim that money was like poetry , before adding that both give a sense of stability . that unusual but accurate formulation is reminiscent of General August Neidhardt von Gneisenau ’ s famous reply to the Prussian King , who dismissed as “ nothing more than poetry ” von Gneisenau ’ s patriotic concerns in the early nineteenth century .
stable money , too , is the foundation of political order . we should not allow ourselves to be so overwhelmed by today ’ s crisis that we forget that .
Europe ’ s Political Stress Tests
Princeton – In recent years , the European Union – or , more accurately , the powerful countries of northern Europe – has been subjecting its weaker members to social and political “ stress tests ” in the name of fiscal rectitude . as a result , southern Europe and parts of Eastern Europe have become a kind of political laboratory , with experiments producing strikingly varied – and increasingly unpredictable – outcomes in different countries .
while that outcome remains unlikely , it is increasingly clear that many European countries – and the EU as a whole – need to renegotiate their basic social contracts . but European elites , preoccupied with short-term fixes , have not considered the long-term need for such revisions – to their own detriment .
indeed , despite significant variations by country , one trend is becoming increasingly apparent across the EU : voters , regardless of their political orientation , are ejecting at the first opportunity leaders who implement austerity . but , beyond this overwhelming opposition to austerity , countries ’ experiences vary widely .
Greece has seen the rise of an overtly fascist party , Golden Dawn , which proudly celebrates the legacy of former dictator Ioannis Metaxas . although Golden Dawn has existed for roughly two decades , only in the last year did it gain enough support to enter parliament .
the party has simply stepped in where the Greek state – long plagued by inefficiency and corruption – has retreated , providing basic welfare and other services to desperate citizens , while engaging in unprecedented violence against people who are or look like immigrants . one way that Golden Dawn attempts to embody the state is by having party members out on the streets as vigilantes .
austerity has similarly sharpened a long-standing crisis of statehood and political legitimacy in Italy , reflected in the rise of a new anti-establishment party , the Five Star Movement , which claims to transcend the traditional left-right political spectrum . indeed , the movement lacks clear policy objectives , instead capitalizing on popular disgust with Italy ’ s political elites – a sentiment that led directly to the last election ’ s failure to produce a clear winner .
in Spain , for example , voters understood the implications of supporting the ruling Popular Party , making it one of the only southern states where the government had some kind of mandate to implement tough austerity . but the mutually reinforcing recession and debt crisis that Spain now faces have reinvigorated Catalonia ’ s long-standing secessionist movement ; austerity has transformed a chronic , though manageable , problem into an acute existential question .
similarly , Portugal ’ s center-right Social Democratic Party has pushed a tough pro-austerity line , including tax hikes and spending cuts , since coming to power in 2011 . but new measures introduced last month have driven an increasingly frustrated population – which , until recently , had endured painful austerity with little of the public outcry seen elsewhere in southern Europe – to the streets to demand a general election two years ahead of schedule .
first and foremost , the dogma that solid public finances – and , more broadly , a functioning state – can be achieved only through painful austerity is an illusion . when forced to choose between their societies and their clientele , politicians may well decide that allowing social tensions to rise – even to dangerous levels – is better than sacrificing their own power bases .
in fact , when Germany embarked a decade ago on a reform program featuring major cuts to the welfare state and a more flexible labor market , it broke the rules of the eurozone ’ s Stability and Growth Pact . public spending had to rise before it could fall , in order to provide some slack while renegotiating parts of the social contract .
building the needed support for a new social contract will require an appeal to fairness , not just to fiscal rectitude . and a mechanism to authorize the new deal – such as a grand coalition actually empowered by elections ( not just reluctant support by major parties for technocratic leaders like Italy ’ s Mario Monti ) – is essential .
Iceland , for example , has embarked on an unprecedented experiment in crafting a bottom-up , “ crowd-sourced ” constitution . similarly , albeit less radically , ordinary citizens comprise two-thirds of Ireland ’ s Constitutional Convention .
if southern eurozone countries followed the route of forging a new social deal , they would have to ensure that it ultimately intersects with the paths of the northern European members . while all eurozone countries do not have to converge on a single model , their interdependence means that a pan-European social and economic settlement is needed .
European leaders must move beyond the increasingly implausible mantra of “ belt-tightening today ; full bellies tomorrow , ” and recognize that , at its core , the euro crisis is a political crisis . rather than focus on quick policy fixes , Europe ’ s leaders need to pursue long-term solutions .
Europe ’ s Populists at the Gate
investors , policy analysts , and even officials are quietly beginning to suggest that this might be the case . the euro has strengthened by nearly 10 % against the dollar since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi vowed on July 26 to do “ whatever it takes ” to hold the currency together .
similarly , the Euro VIX , a popular measure of expectations of euro volatility , has fallen significantly . the cost of buying protection against fluctuations in the euro / dollar exchange rate declined last month to its lowest level in nearly five years .
European leaders have put in place mechanisms to support Italy and Spain . as of October , the continent has an operational European Stability Mechanism to purchase new Italian and Spanish government bonds if investors go on strike .
in parallel , the ECB has announced an “ outright monetary transactions ” ( OMT ) program to purchase bonds already trading on the secondary market . at their most recent summit , European Union leaders reiterated their commitment to finalize the design of a single supervisory mechanism by January 1 , 2013 , and to activate it by the end of next year .
with the ESM and ECB capping interest rates on government bonds , countries will have as much time as they need – and they will need plenty – to reduce their debt burdens to manageable levels . and , with a single supervisor in place , the ESM will be permitted to inject capital directly into troubled banks .
the ESM has limited firepower , and , along with the ECB , will buy only the bonds of governments that ask , something that proud leaders are reluctant to do . the end-2013 deadline for implementation of the banking union is a long way off .
nevertheless , the markets evidently regard this as a comforting bedtime story – all the more so now that European leaders have averred that Greece will not be pushed out of the eurozone . officials recognize that cutting off EU support and compelling the ECB to stop providing credit to the Bank of Greece would be Europe ’ s Lehman Brothers moment .
in their October 18 communiqué , eurozone leaders stated in no uncertain terms that they are not prepared to go there . given Europe ’ s facility at creative accounting , some way will be found to keep Greece on life support .
mass anti-austerity protests are one warning sign . another is growing popular support for neo-Nazi movements like Golden Dawn , now the third-largest political party in Greece .
the rise to power of a “ rejectionist ” European government – that is , one that unilaterally rejects the policy status quo – would immediately bring the crisis to a head . a Greek government that summarily rejected conditions set by the EU and the International Monetary Fund would immediately be cut off by the ECB and forced to exit the euro .
the answer to these critics is , unfortunately , “ just wait . ” It is worth recalling that nearly four years passed from the onset of the Great Depression in Germany to the Nazis ’ accession to power .
the continuing absence of such policies is the gravest threat to the euro . unless that changes , markets will wake up to that risk – perhaps with a jolt – sooner or later .
the Political Stock Market
many economic and financial analysts complain that emerging countries &apos; stock markets are often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more political than economic . the unstated assumption seems to be that , in contrast , some pristine force of economic nature drives stock markets in advanced countries , and that forecasting their performance is thus like forecasting the growth of trees .
this description of stock markets in emerging countries is not wrong , just biased , because the same description applies to stock markets in advanced countries . indeed , the best analysts know that forecasting the performance of any country &apos;s stock market substantially means forecasting how well the government wants stock market investors to fare in the current political environment .
the general perception is that the government leaves companies alone and that the returns from investing in the US stock market reflect the fundamental forces of a strong capitalist economy . this is one reason why the US is a magnet for portfolio investors from around the world .
during World War II , for example , political support for great fortunes diminished and the government sharply increased taxes on capital gains , dividends , and high incomes in general . when World War II produced a strong recovery from the Great Depression of the 1930 &apos;s , President Roosevelt and Congress slapped on an excess-profits tax to ensure that shareholders would not benefit too much .
by contrast , in 1980 , when there was no war but the stock market was low , US voters elected Ronald Reagan , a man many thought too right wing to be president . he asked for - and got - cuts in capital gains , dividend , and income taxes .
property taxes , excise taxes , import duties , and sales taxes - all of which are paid , directly or indirectly , by corporations - can have a magnified impact on corporate profits , and hence on the stock market . it is no coincidence that wherever stock markets thrive , governments take care that these taxes stop well short of destroying after-tax corporate profits .
indeed , the politics of stock markets does not stop with taxes . on the contrary , almost every activity of government has an impact on corporate profits , and in turn , on the stock market .
after the 1929 stock market crash the US government suspended much anti-trust activity , allowing companies to acquire monopoly power that would boost their value . this policy delayed the recovery from high unemployment , but even that was not enough to rein in the political forces arrayed in favor of supporting the stock market .
similarly , one of the most important things that President Reagan did was to destroy much of the remaining power of America &apos;s labor unions , which compete for their share of the corporate pie . Reagan &apos;s defeat of the Air Traffic Controllers &apos; strike in 1981 was a watershed event for the US labor movement - and for the stock market , which started its dramatic bull market in 1982 .
the US government has been particularly aggressive in supporting the stock market since the peak of the equities price bubble in 2000 , most notably cutting interest rates repeatedly . of course , this was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy , not supporting the stock market .
moreover , after the stock market crash , the maximum tax on dividends paid on stocks was slashed from 35 % to 15 % , giving a substantial new advantage to long-term investors and boosting the compounding effect of reinvesting after-tax dividends . again , this tax cut was justified in terms of stimulating the economy , which can , of course , be said of practically any measure aimed at supporting the stock market .
one might say that the same variables , including hostility to high taxes and a weak labor movement , have operated in the US for the past 200 years - and can thus be expected to continue operating in the future , producing high stock market returns and attracting huge inflows of foreign investment . those who believe that investments in the US stock market will maintain the same strong growth trend for decades may well be right .
the Human Thatcher
London – It is difficult to separate some of my personal memories of Margaret Thatcher – mundane but revealing – from the sweeping judgments of history . I had worked for her as the Conservative Party ’ s research director , and as a minister for about 15 years , before going to Hong Kong as Britain ’ s last Governor there .
I also remember that , while our official residence was full of excellent , hardworking staff ( to whom she was always kind and courteous ) , she was the only visitor – and there were many – who made her own bed ! the job was done with all the care and precision of a grand hotel : boxed corners and neatly turned-down cover .
since the Tiananmen killings , which he had tried to avert through compromise , he had been under house arrest . by asking whichever senior officials she saw to pass on her gift and her best wishes to Zhao , the Chinese leadership would understand that the outside world was still thinking of him and wanted to ensure his survival .
as a national leader , Thatcher ’ s principal achievements were to reverse Britain ’ s decline , which had gained momentum in the 1970 ’ s , before her first term as Prime Minister in 1979 . little of the extensive coverage of her death has focused on what Britain was like in those years .
paradoxically , she made accountable and authoritative government possible again partly by curtailing the state ’ s role in the economy . her reforms laid the foundations for a period during which Britain ’ s per capita wealth grew faster than most of its competitors ’ .
Thatcher ’ s reforms reinvigorated the private sector , promoted home ownership , lowered taxes on enterprise , deregulated large parts of the economy , and reined in the unions ’ power to use their industrial muscle . she set about this reform program with determination , but – at least until her last years – with subtle pragmatism as well .
she had been an outspoken critic of Soviet communism , like her transatlantic friend and partner , Ronald Reagan . her espousal of free markets – indeed , her ringing declarations about the link between political and economic freedom – inspired the Soviet bloc ’ s peoples , who had suffered under the Soviet yoke for 40 years .
while her antipathy to German reunification was ill-judged , her doubts about the ability to reconcile greater political integration in the European Union with democratic accountability in its member states has gained many more sympathizers over the years – and not only in her own country . she pushed for greater integration of the European single market , while questioning whether this really required ceding more political authority to the European Commission .
many consider the Falklands War in 1982 as the apogee of her patriotism . it was just as much a sign of her political bravado . &amp; # 160 ;
the recovery of this far-flung British dependency , whose citizens were resolutely committed to remaining British subjects after the Argentine invasion , was a daring military act . it could have gone terribly wrong , bringing down her and her administration .
they were very different characters who shared a similar philosophy , albeit expressed with more charm by a president who much admired her directness and her simple , even blunt assertions of the old verities . “ Isn ’ t she wonderful , ” he is reported to have said to an aide , one hand over the telephone , as she scolded him from London for some US policy error .
she did not “ triangulate ” in an effort to find the middle point between opposing views ; she deplored the idea that the middle ground of politics , where most voters dwell , was pre-determined by a &amp; # 160 ; wishy-washy elite consensus . &amp; # 160 ; An effective leader , she believed , could shift this political terrain by convincing people of the truth and relevance of his or her position .
Thatcher was often more careful than her admirers have subsequently suggested in the way she set about doing this . but , ultimately , her passion for the ideas to which she was devoted splashed bright colors across a political world usually painted in shades of grey .
like everyone else , she made mistakes and got some things wrong . but she was undoubtedly a giant of twentieth-century politics , a leader who changed her and our world – for the better .
the Asian Tigers of Nationalism
Denver – Among the many arguments that former Serbian President Slobodan Milošević used to make to his interlocutors was that he never incited nationalism among his people . indeed , his public statements and speeches during those turbulent times were carefully calibrated to avoid any outright exhortation to nationalism .
but it was not so much the words that he used as it was the music . with his crafty use of code words and body language to encourage a sense of victimhood among Serbs , Milošević was one of the most demagogic nationalists Europe had seen in generations .
the patterns of this age-old scourge are familiar , featuring national narratives based on a supposed record of victimization . in China ’ s case , the narrative revolves around “ the century of shame , ” when China was too weak to defend itself against encroachments on its sovereignty , and the idea that it should never have to succumb again .
among Japanese nationalist groups , the narrative is one of frustration with the wartime Allies ’ version of history ; almost 70 years – and billions of dollars in reparations and foreign assistance – later , Japan would like to move on . “ We are done apologizing , ” Liberal Democratic Party leader Shinzo Abe has said .
whether this outbreak of nationalism will end soon depends on the willingness of governments in the region – not just China ’ s – to take a stand and appeal to their publics to cease and desist . these governments need to engage in a more honest dialogue with their citizens .
while historical frustration often shapes the narratives that fuel nationalism , there are clearly deeper and more powerful forces at work . one of Japan ’ s persistent problems in recent years has been growing disenchantment with the political class and its inability to articulate a vision for the country ’ s future .
having already passed its population peak , it will , in the continued absence of significant immigration , begin an increasingly rapid slide down the demographic curve , becoming a country that is much smaller than it is today . and China has been a major source of angst for Japan , because , historically , there has seldom been a time when both countries could be strong .
and , just as the British made the transition from “ Rule Britannia ” to “ Cool Britannia , ” Japan , too , can engage in an internal process to define better its identity as a vibrant modern culture in the context of globalization . Japanese culture has global reach , and much to be proud of , besides a desultory and unproductive debate about victimization and rock-strewn islands .
China is moving toward another leadership transition , relatively calm by the standards of other powers , where elections sometimes take on the characteristics of political warfare . China ’ s political rivalries do not play out in televised national debates ; rather , they play out in the shadows , leaving the public to guess what the country ’ s leadership has in store .
while some of the criticism calls for more openness and accountability in government , much of it is less inspiring to the rest of us . the critics ask – often in pointed terms – what the government is doing to safeguard the country ’ s economic interests .
in democratic countries , such critics would group themselves into some kind of political movement , ultimately creating an opposition party that , through the dialectical process of democracy , would influence policymaking by the party in power . China , however , lacks the institutional framework needed to channel this sentiment into the political process .
meanwhile , the Chinese Communist Party has no intention of ceding economic nationalism to an Internet-based proto-opposition . after all , rapid economic growth lies at the heart of the CCP ’ s raison d ’ état , so it embraces economic nationalism , whether in disputes with Japan , the Southeast Asian countries , or the United States .
however it is done ( which is for the Chinese to figure out ) , China has no choice but to embrace a world order based on stable relationships among countries – including its own neighbors . indeed , whether nationalists like it or not , this is the future that China has , in effect , already chosen .
regardless of whether it charts a course toward a brighter or darker future , a country ’ s political leadership by definition plays the central role at the helm . leaders of both China and Japan need to accept their position in this process and , above all , not simply ride on the froth of current events .
the Politics of Anger Management
indeed , “ traitor ” was one of their common epithets , as were “ coward ” and “ sellout . ” Real-estate mogul Donald Trump , with his customary charm , thought it appropriate to refer to the brilliant and scholarly Roberts as a “ dummy . ”
the apoplectic rage that followed the Supreme Court ’ s decision on Obama ’ s health-care legislation is becoming routine in America ’ s public discourse , and it is a bipartisan malady . though it may have started on the left – in response to Richard Nixon , Ronald Reagan , and George W. Bush – it has become increasingly a right-wing phenomenon .
for example , the bloody conflict in Syria is fraught with challenges and unforeseen consequences . but such realities are lost on bloggers who blithely hold forth on what they claim are patently obvious solutions – and on the stupidity , cynicism , or insanity of leaders who fail to implement them .
officials have an obligation to look beyond the current news cycle , and especially to understand that policy aimed at Syria , for example , engages policy toward Russia , Iraq , Lebanon , Egypt , and Israel . as a result , it is profoundly difficult to develop policies that enjoy support at every excruciating phase of their implementation .
one aspect of knowledge , as we know from nineteenth-century philosophy ( and who studies that anymore ? ) , reflects the integration of information with experience . today , information is integrated with emotion – and with suspicion , sometimes bordering on paranoia , about the underlying motives of the leadership classes .
compare this behavior to that of people who have truly suffered at the hands of political leaders – for example , South Africa ’ s Nelson Mandela , Burma ’ s Aung San Suu Kyi , or Poland ’ s Adam Michnik – and who managed to conduct respectful dialogue with their tormentors . their tolerance , one suspects , would not have been diminished had they had access to the Internet during their incarceration .
mainstream media ( whatever that expression means anymore ) woo viewers by enabling them to “ sound off ” at the press of a button . as anyone who has read a thoughtful article or news story can attest , bitter , vituperative responses usually follow .
clearly , there is something more going on than just an increase in clickable menu options . one fundamental issue seems to be dwindling respect for established institutions , many of which are drowning in the noise of opinion .
digital technology has played another important role in fostering this atmosphere of bad manners , vicious personal attacks , intolerance , disrespect , and general rudeness . sitting in one ’ s basement in pajamas , spewing out venom on a keyboard like a Batman movie villain who was poorly treated in a past life , one is at a safe distance from one ’ s target .
indeed , perhaps the most damaging aspect of all of our wonderful technology is that it enables us to live blissfully apart from those with whom we disagree . our access to news can be tailored to our preconceived opinions .
for starters , they could make a mid-summer resolution to buck the trend . they might , for example , resist the Internet algorithm that suggests which book to buy or film to rent , based on what they read or watched previously .
the Politics of Cosmic Catastrophe
Washington , DC – One weighty decision that the world will need to make in 2010 is whether to support an idea raised by Anatoly Perminov , the head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos , to launch an unmanned mission to redirect a large asteroid that might collide with Earth after 2030 .
at more than 360 meters in diameter , the asteroid , Apophis , is a dozen times larger than the Tunguska space object ( presumably a meteorite or comet ) that devastated a large part of eastern Siberia a century ago . as far as can be determined , that object detonated on June 30 , 1908 , with the power of a nuclear weapon , felling 80 million trees over a 2,000-square-kilometer area .
according to NASA , if Apophis hit the Earth , it could release more than 100,000 times the energy of the Tunguska event . thousands of square kilometers could vaporize in the blast , but the whole Earth would suffer from the loss of sunlight and other effects of the dust released into the atmosphere .
current projections are that Apophis , which was discovered in 2004 , will orbit near the earth several times between 2029 and 2036 . in October 2009 , near-Earth object ( NEO ) trackers Steve Chesley and Paul Chodas of NASA &apos;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , placed the odds of Apophis striking Earth in 2036 at about one in 233,000 , lower than previous estimates .
but their forecast that it would come within 30,000 kilometers of our planet in 2029 ( closer than some geostationary communications satellites , as well as the Moon ) is more likely to please astronomers than international security experts . some unknown comet or other space object could fly near enough to the asteroid in the next few decades to change its predicted path , perhaps in a way that redirected it toward Earth .
according to Perminov , the proposals that Roscosmos is considering do not envision trying to destroy the asteroid , but rather to use the laws of physics to change its path . he says that if Roscosmos ’ s management decided to act , it would work with experts from Europe , the United States , China , and other space powers to decide how best to proceed .
some have suggested placing a large object nearby to change its trajectory through mutual gravitational attraction . another method is to use mirrors , light , or painted colors to change the way the asteroid absorbs heat , which could also shift its direction .
a few scientists , and many science-fiction writers , have also speculated about using nuclear weapons to destroy or damage an asteroid , comet , meteor , or alien spacecraft heading toward the earth . the Outer Space Treaty bans placing nuclear weapons in orbit , on celestial bodies , or stationing “ such weapons in outer space in any other manner , ” but may be interpreted to permit their one-time use .
even if the nuclear warhead broke the asteroid into many small pieces , they could have time to re-combine into another large object . in addition , the space vehicle carrying the weapon might malfunction , and the nuclear warhead could land ( and perhaps detonate ) somewhere on Earth .
the safest approach might be to test several techniques on nearby asteroids before using them against Apophis when it approaches Earth . unfortunately , it is estimated that “ attacking ” an asteroid would cost billions of dollars , especially since multiple space launches would likely be needed to ensure that the required number of probes could complete the mission .
this raises the issue of who should pay for such a mission and , more fundamentally , who can authorize it . these global governance questions also apply to other worldwide threats , such as climate change , that threaten humanity ’ s survival .
in 2008 , a report by space experts called for the United Nations Security Council to make the final decision about how to counter potential threats from near-Earth objects . the Security Council normally votes on issues that threaten international peace and security , but this method would allow only a small number of governments to decide Earth ’ s fate .
since an asteroid collision could , like global climate change , affect all of humanity , should not everyone have some say in the decision ? perhaps every country should vote in the UN General Assembly on how to proceed ; the option receiving the most votes – with a possible mandatory minimum requirement , such as requiring an alternative to win a majority or some higher number of votes – would prevail .
would Russia or a coalition of willing countries have the right to attempt to alter Apophis ’ orbit without the approval of other states ? what are the rights and duties of scientists and governments who consider the risks to be graver than their counterparts in other countries do ?
Perminov ’ s proposal has raised important questions – both scientific and political . whatever the danger posed by Apophis , we would do well to begin addressing them .
the Politics of Frustration
does extreme poverty breed violence and ultimately revolution ? many people believe that it does , and seek to explain phenomena ranging from guerrilla insurgencies to Islamist terrorism accordingly .
but Karl Marx and Alexis de Tocqueville , the two great social analysts of the nineteenth century , knew better what makes people tick , and what makes societies change . extreme poverty breeds apathy , not rebellion .
a far more critical group in any society are those who have begun to move forward to new conditions , but then find their path blocked . their desires and ambitions are not unrealistic in the circumstances , but they are frustrated .
this group , not the desperately poor and helpless , forms the great mobilizing force of violent protest , and ultimately of major change .
the politics of frustration has been particularly apparent in the postcommunist world during the last fifteen years . the heavy hand of nomenklatura rule was gone , and the vision of a new life like that in the open societies of the West seemed real .
those who had the chance migrated , first to their homeland ’ s centers of economic progress , then abroad , to countries and places where the new world could be found immediately . those who stayed behind began to vote in strange ways – electing , for example , the successors of the old Communist parties that they had been glad to get rid of only a few years before .
it made the valley of tears bearable both by offering financial and other assistance and by holding out the promise of membership and economic prosperity in the near future . equally important , had the EU not supported the creation of an administrative and social infrastructure of liberty , there might well have been a more serious communist or even fascist backlash in Poland , Hungary , and elsewhere .
with the onset of modernization , millions of people were uprooted from their traditional communities and ways of life . young men , in particular , saw the prospect of a life more like that presented to them by Western television .
but they soon discovered that realizing this prospect would require a longer and more arduous journey than they had anticipated . in fact , it would take at least a generation , during which much of the effort of modern life would have to be made , while the fruits of this effort would remain elusive .
earlier generations may have borne the burden of working and waiting more readily , but nowadays people want results here and now . if the benefits do not come quickly – and for most people they do not – they get restless .
those who do not manage to get to other countries , or who fail in the countries to which they have migrated , are in a quandary . for them , the old world of traditional ties and customs is gone , but the new world of modernity remains out of reach .
seductive leaders ( Hitler among them ) exploited the resulting sense of frustration . whatever the value of such theories , it is evident that the frustration of young people ’ s ambitions in modernizing countries makes them the object of preachers of hate and tempts them to leave the course of plodding progress and turn to more dramatic action .
what we call “ terrorism ” has many causes , and one must beware of facile explanations . however , the politics of frustration , of ambitions raised and then thwarted , is clearly one such cause .
it is thus also a challenge to those of us living in more fortunate circumstances . if we do not wish to be submerged in violence and authoritarian responses to it , international institutions must do for the modernizing world what the EU has managed to do for the postcommunist countries .
why Are the Wealthier Healthier ?
DURHAM – In 1842 , the English social reformer Edwin Chadwick documented a 30-year discrepancy between the life expectancy of men in the poorest social classes and that of the gentry . today , people in the most affluent areas of the United Kingdom , such as Kensington and Chelsea , can expect to live 14 years longer than those in the poorest cities , such as Glasgow .
such inequalities exist , to varying degrees , in all developed countries . poorer groups fare particularly badly in the neo-liberal system of the United States ; gaps in life expectancy in some US cities , such as New Orleans , are as large as 25 years .
understanding and reducing these health inequalities remains a major public-policy challenge worldwide . it is not only a moral issue ; health inequalities carry significant economic costs .
the prevailing explanation for health inequalities is rooted in the social determinants of health – that is , the environments in which people work and live . affluent people have better access to health-promoting environments , such as well-maintained schools that offer a good education , high-quality housing , and stable jobs in secure , safe settings .
various theories draw on this basic framework – and each competing explanation suggests different strategies for reducing health inequalities . for example , the “ cultural-behavioral ” approach explains health inequalities in terms of differences in individual behaviors , asserting that poorer people have worse health outcomes , owing to a higher propensity to smoke , drink alcohol , and eat less healthy foods .
the “ materialist ” approach takes a broader view , arguing that people with more money can essentially purchase better health through superior education , health care , and social services . accordingly , countries can reduce health inequalities by introducing higher minimum incomes for their poorest citizens and guaranteeing universal access to public services .
by contrast , “ psychosocial ” theories suggest that it is the psychological experience of inequality – the feelings of inferiority or superiority generated by social hierarchies – that matters . this view implies that the poorest individuals and communities need to feel productive , valued , and empowered to take control of their own lives , rather than feel trapped in a subordinate position .
the “ life course ” approach combines multiple theories to contend that the unequal accumulation of social , psychological , and biological advantages or disadvantages over time , beginning in utero , produces health inequalities . it demands early intervention to put children on a positive health path , together with an adequate social safety net throughout citizens ’ lives .
the most encompassing view is that of the “ political-economy ” school , which argues that health inequalities are determined by capitalist economies ’ hierarchical structure and the associated political choices about resource distribution . this analysis calls for the most radical action : to develop an economic and social system in which resources , particularly wealth and power , are more evenly distributed .
given that all of these theories can , to some extent , be supported by scientific evidence , politics can matter more than science in determining which strategies policymakers pursue to reduce health inequalities . after all , some potential solutions are politically easier to implement within existing systems than others .
for example , interventions aimed at changing individual behavior are far less challenging to prevailing power structures than those that demand extensive social investment or revitalization of the entire system . thus , governments interested in closing the health gap – such as the British Labour government in 1997-2010 – usually end up pursuing such relatively painless “ downstream ” interventions .
but this approach has proved to be only partly successful in reducing health inequalities , leaving little doubt that more comprehensive measures are needed . indeed , most of the health gains over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were brought about by far-reaching economic , political , and social reforms .
the poorest and most vulnerable groups in social-democratic countries like Sweden and Norway are far healthier and live longer than their counterparts in neo-liberal countries such as the UK or the US . these more egalitarian countries have also achieved comparatively stable , inclusive economic growth and a high standard of living .
the Politics of Revolutionary Surprise
DURHAM – In setting himself ablaze following a humiliating encounter with the police , the university-educated Tunisian vegetable seller Mohamed Bouazizi triggered a wave of protests across the Arab world . several Arab dictators who had held power for decades have already been ousted or forced to announce that they will retire .
but protesters in Cairo , Tunis , and Sana want much more . they also seek efficient governance , economic reforms to stimulate growth , the ouster of collaborators , democratic rights , freedom of religion ( and perhaps also from religion ) – in short , a comprehensive social transformation .
everywhere , incumbent regimes have mounted resistance . the unforgettable scene of camel- and horse-riding Mubarak supporters beating tech-savvy Egyptian protesters signals that the old order will not yield without a fight .
had the United States known what lay ahead , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would not have remarked , after demonstrations broke out in Egypt , that the Egyptian government was “ stable . ” Arab leaders now showering their key constituencies with pay raises and food subsidies would have done so earlier , thus avoiding the impression of vulnerability .
longtime regime opponents , too , were caught off guard . for days after Egypt erupted , the Muslim Brotherhood did not know how to react , making it seem out of touch with the “ Arab street . ”
for decades , most Arabs , however unhappy , kept their political grievances private , for fear of persecution if they turned against their leaders publicly . through private discussions with trusted friends , everyone sensed that discontent was common , yet no one knew , or could know , the extent of it .
that much was understood widely by entrenched Arab dictators , who saw to it that their intelligence and security corps extinguished any flame before it could spread .
the fire spread so fast that by the time Arab leaders understood what it would consume , it was beyond anyone ’ s control , and in more than one country . the overthrown Tunisian dictator must now regret that his security forces did not arrest Bouazizi and lock him up , rather than allow his public self-immolation .
as it turned out , by the time the seriousness of the rebellion became clear , fear was already changing sides even within the halls of Tunisian power . President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali ’ s aides had started worrying more about being caught on the wrong side of Tunisian history than about facing the wrath of their beleaguered boss .
the mechanisms underlying this political unpredictability are not unique to the Arab world . unforeseen uprisings are possible wherever repression keeps people from expressing their political preferences openly .
in 1989 , the fall of repressive East European regimes in quick succession stunned the world , including dissidents who had long recognized communism ’ s vulnerabilities . just before the Iranian Revolution of 1979 , a CIA report characterized the Iranian monarchy as an “ island of stability . ”
as in Iran in 1979 , demonstrators united in opposition to the old regime have wildly differing goals . their biggest demands – secure jobs , faster growth , low food prices – are not necessarily compatible , and they may require policies that inflict pain .
alas , given their histories of autocratic rule , giant leaps forward to full-blown democracy are unlikely . though steps toward democracy are possible , when the euphoria of the moment passes , political contenders will realize that , if only in self-defense , they must restrict their opponents ’ freedoms .
adding to the complexity of the situation are the Islamists , who have so far kept a low profile . they themselves are divided , with preferences ranging from Sharia rule in one form or another to a “ Turkish model ” involving mild Islamism capable of achieving mass support through the ballot box .
the Arab street has changed the calculus of fear not only in the countries that have witnessed major protests , but also in the rest of the Arab world , where rulers are on notice that discontent need not remain submerged forever . Arab leaders old and new will implement policies designed to alleviate popular dissatisfaction .
the Politics of Values
how did President George W. Bush manage to get three million votes more than Senator John Kerry , and , in addition , to have a Republican majority elected in both houses of Congress ? there is not much agreement on the answers , but two themes recur in many explanations .
people voted for a set of values rather than for specific policies . indeed , some ( it is said ) agreed with Kerry ’ s policies but nevertheless gave their vote to Bush , because they felt “ at ease ” with his general attitudes .
gerrymandering – the drawing of electoral boundaries to benefit a particular political party – is no longer necessary . people actually tend to move to areas in which a majority of others share their values , whether Republican or Democratic .
gays and other “ modern ” practices are rejected as self-indulgent . as the political scientist Andrew Hacker recently put it , “ the Bush candidacy was framed to make a majority by giving some 60 million people a chance to feel good about themselves . ”
personality undoubtedly matters , and beneath overt political differences there may also be issues of values that have not yet come to the fore . but traditional political differences based on disagreement over fundamental values play a diminishing part in elections .
for example , Prime Minister Tony Blair , the next major leader to face an election , plays the personality card and talks about policies , but he represents above all a set of middle-class values . when he speaks of “ modernization , ” or of “ bringing things into the twenty-first century , ” he manages to suggest a strange but appealing mixture of change and stability .
the German debate is still largely a policy debate . when the opposition offers the government talks on health-care reform or , most recently , on combating unemployment , the underlying competition is about competence rather than values .
yet underneath the common battlegrounds of political debate in Britain and Germany and elsewhere in Europe , value clashes are lurking . parties fight for those who can be made “ to feel good about themselves , ” but they may not fully realize that this is only partly a matter of policy .
religion is not likely to become a major factor in European politics ; opinion polls show that religious observance marks one of the few major differences between Americans and Europeans . guns also have a different place in the European mind ; it is their absence that most Europeans regard as important .
people want to know where they belong , and in the process they turn against the US and toward Europe , or against Europe and toward their country . either way , we leave the realms of policies , and even of politics , and enter the murky domain of symbols and myth .
this , at any rate , is the main risk that democratic countries face , for the politics of values is a dangerous development . it reintroduces fundamental divisions in societies whose greatest democratic achievement was precisely to banish fundamentalism from politics .
the Post-Nuclear Transition
Berlin – The Fukushima disaster in March reminded the world , 25 years after Chernobyl , that nuclear energy is anything but clean , secure , and affordable . unfortunately , another nuclear catastrophe was needed to trigger a fresh debate on the use of nuclear power .
other European countries have yet to indicate whether they will follow Germany ’ s example ; a world free from nuclear energy is hard for its supporters to imagine . Europe ’ s economic and ecological future , however , depends upon the rising opposition to this high-risk technology , such as in Italy , where a recent referendum delivered a large popular majority against nuclear energy .
over the past few decades , anti-nuclear activists , together with their political representatives in the Green Party , have succeeded in mobilizing hundreds of thousands of protesters . in 2000 , growing political pressure finally led to a consensus between the German government and energy companies , which agreed to limit the life span of nuclear-power plants to 32 years .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s coalition government withdrew from this agreement in 2010 , but Fukushima forced the authorities to reconsider – and to permanently end the use of nuclear energy . German energy policy now depends once more on the future deployment of renewable energy sources .
the current European stress tests of nuclear-power plants are a first step ; but , as long as they are voluntary and under the operators ’ control , they will be nothing more than political window dressing . for example , there are no plans to test any of the 143 nuclear power plants currently operating in the European Union for core safety risks , such as a terrorist attack or a plane crash .
nuclear power is an antiquated technology that requires billions of euros in subsidies ; so far , German taxpayers have contributed € 196 billion for this purpose . a German government study has estimated that , between 2010 and 2050 , Germany could save more than € 700 billion by relying on non-nuclear renewable energy instead of nuclear power or imported fossil fuels such as coal , gas , and oil .
the expansion of renewable energy production also holds great potential for boosting economic growth . over the past decade , 370,000 new jobs have been created in the sector , and exports of renewable-energy technology are rising rapidly , totaling roughly € 30 billion from 2006 to 2008 .
first , increased reliance on fossil fuels runs contrary to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol ’ s targets for reducing carbon emissions , as well as to the EU ’ s own climate-change objectives . moreover , fossil-fuel costs fluctuate wildly with oil prices , and the centralized nature of nuclear and coal-fired power stations creates distribution problems .
wind energy is now competitive with conventional power plants , while rising gas and coal prices and the steady decline in renewable-energy costs imply that , within a few years , fossil fuels will be even less attractive . moreover , revenues from “ home-grown ” energy tend to remain where they are generated , while the import bill for fossil fuels would be eliminated .
indeed , the idea of a “ nuclear renaissance ” is a myth . nuclear accidents , public opposition , and high capital costs have already provoked a drastic drop in nuclear-energy investment ; in the United States , no nuclear-power plant has been commissioned since the late 1970 ’ s .
more money from the EU budget now goes to nuclear research than to non-nuclear research and development , and more infrastructure funding goes to carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) and conventional energy than to renewable energies . the forthcoming negotiations on the EU ’ s 2014-2020 European budget are an opportunity to change direction and cut the funding for unpromising mega-projectslike the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( ITER ) effort in southern France .
shifting to renewable-energy sources will require enormous effort and major infrastructure investment . High-voltage transmission lines across the EU and storage facilities to overcome the problem of meeting basic energy demands will be crucial , as will decentralized distribution grids and higher investment in energy conservation .
Germany has taken the first step , but the transition to a fully renewable-energy-based economy must be a common European effort .
robots on the Brain
Calgary – When Harvey Cushing and William Bovie introduced electrocautery ( which uses a high-frequency current to seal blood vessels or make incisions ) in 1926 , their innovation transformed neurosurgery . given the precision required to operate on an organ as delicate as the brain , the convergence of mechanical technologies with the art of surgery catalyzed progress in the field .
neurosurgical advances always pursue minimalism . as in any other surgical field , the less the procedure interferes with the body , the less likely it is to affect the patient ’ s quality of life adversely , and the sooner the patient will be able to return to normal activity .
this imperative is even more pronounced when it comes to sensitive neurological procedures . tasks like maneuvering small blood vessels that are 1-2 millimeters in diameter , or removing a brain tumor without damaging the surrounding tissue , require technologies , such as the operating microscope and multimodal imaging tools , that complement surgeons ’ skills and augment their abilities .
robots are capable of performing repetitive tasks with a higher degree of precision and accuracy than are humans , and without muscle fatigue . and they can be upgraded periodically to integrate new features seamlessly .
what robots lack is the human brain ’ s executive capacity . given that comprehending – and reacting appropriately to – the immense number of variables that can arise during surgery would require enormous computing power , surgical robots aim to integrate human experience and decision-making ability with mechanized accuracy .
one example of this convergence is neuroArm , developed by my research team at the University of Calgary in conjunction with engineers at MacDonald , Dettwiler and Associates . the neuroArm actually has two arms , which can hold various surgical tools while the surgeon maneuvers them from a remote workstation .
technologies like MRI can help in surgical planning , resection control , and quality assurance . Magnetic-resonance-compatible robotics allow for real-time imaging , providing information about anatomical structures and changes in the brain relative to surgical pathology while operating , thereby minimizing risk .
given that the robot receives the MRIs and provides haptic feedback , electronic highways or surgical corridors can be established before the procedure , as can “ no-go ” zones . tool manipulation can thus occur only within the predetermined corridor , preventing unintended injury to the brain .
motion scaling – which allows the robotic arms to mimic the exact movements of the surgeon ’ s hands , but on a much smaller scale – will enable surgeons to manipulate tissue that is too small for the naked eye to detect . with the development of smaller microsurgical tools and high-performance cameras and monitors , operating at the cellular level will be possible .
building on simulation technology , virtual reality will allow surgeons to rehearse procedures , including with surgical robots , in a digital environment . the ability to map out complex cases and practice rare procedures before performing them on a patient will undoubtedly lead to better surgical performance and improved medical outcomes .
virtual reality will also enhance surgical training , by providing students with a wider range of experience and enabling quantification of their performance . surgeons operating manually know how much force they exert only by the way it feels ; a surgical simulator , by contrast , could measure that force and indicate when a trainee is applying excessive or insufficient pressure .
moreover , instructors will be able to program controlled scenarios to assess how a trainee copes in challenging circumstances . the ability to reset and retry surgeries without any risk or additional cost will enhance neurosurgical training significantly .
given that realistic neurosurgical simulations , which must account for a large number of variables and potential outcomes , are particularly difficult to develop , virtual reality is not yet being used widely in the field . but surgical-simulation technology is advancing rapidly , bolstered by developments in parallel computing .
the merging of human surgical experience with machines and computerized technologies is driving neurosurgical advancement , with robotic surgery serving as an important model of the benefits of the human-machine interface . add virtual reality to the equation and the future of neurosurgery takes shape – a future in which the discipline is elevated to new levels of excellence .
the Powerlessness of the Powerful
in Europe , populist demagogues , such as Geert Wilders in the Netherlands , rant and rage against the elitist “ appeasers ” of Islam . in Thailand , red-shirted demonstrators from the country ’ s rural northeast rant and rage against the military , social , and political elites of Bangkok .
the first principle of democracy is that government must be based on popular consent , even if the government is made up of parties for which many people did not vote . it is clear from the worldwide rage against elected governments that this consent is becoming dangerously threadbare .
American populism is not the same as Thai populism . culture and race play important roles in the United States – the culture of carrying guns , for example , and the discomfort at having a black , Harvard-educated president who talks like a law professor .
in Thailand , the rage stems from the perceived neglect of the rural poor by the ruling class , backed by big business , the army , and the king . the populist billionaire and former Prime Minister , Thaksin Shinawatra , appeared to be different .
authoritarian , crude , and somewhat megalomaniacal ( almost as though he were a king himself ) , Thaksin was a Thai version of Silvio Berlusconi . he was removed from office in 2006 , following a bloodless military coup that was supported by the Bangkok middle class , whose members took to the streets in yellow T-shirts ( the color of the Thai monarchy ) .
in Europe , the power of the European Union , often-uncontrolled immigration , and economic globalization are challenging feelings of national belonging , of being represented by national governments , or of sharing national cultures . demagogues who denounce multiculturalism and warn of the “ Islamization ” of the West are exploiting the resultant fears about the loss of national identity .
the sense that globalization is creating new classes of haves and have-nots is a factor that inflames most current forms of populism , regardless of national differences . at the same time , new technology , without which globalization would not be possible , is being used to mobilize people for populist causes , too .
the heroine of the US Tea Party movement , Sarah Palin , is as much a creature of twittering and the vast new blogosphere as she is of television and radio – perhaps more so . indeed , the shift of public debate from the mainstream press to the Internet has helped to break down the authority of traditional elites : newspaper editors , political columnists , academics , politicians .
the tone of populist movements , whether in Europe , Asia , or the US , would suggest that the elites are too powerful , that they dominate the little people , whose voices are drowned out by the liberals , the multiculturalists , and the city slickers . this is a common form of populist paranoia , promoted in the US by radio talk-show hosts and Fox television , and in Europe by men like Wilders .
after endorsing a military coup to get rid of Thaksin , the yellow-shirts of Bangkok can hardly blame the red-shirts for using undemocratic tactics to force the current government to step down . American liberals , too , are often guilty of sneering at the tastes and habits of their provincial countrymen .
the lack of trust in political elites is linked to a suspicion , which is not entirely irrational , that elected governments have little authority . the real power , people suspect , is lodged elsewhere – on Wall Street , in the unelected EU bureaucracy , in the Royal Thai Army and the Royal Palace .
what people crave in uncertain times is strong leadership from charismatic figures who promise to sweep the stables , get rid of corruption , and stand up for the little man against selfish politicians and against foreigners who threaten us with strange habits and religions . such times are dangerous for democracy , because they endanger popular consent to democratic governments .
US President Barack Obama is right to call for more regulation of financial markets . in Europe , either the EU must become more democratic , which will take a long time , or national governments must delegate less to the bureaucrats in Brussels .
Thailand might face the hardest problems . reliance on a self-promoting tycoon like Thaksin is not the best way to boost democracy , but nor is reliance on military coups and kingly intervention .
the Power of China ’ s Powerless
London – No sooner had I finished reading an article that eulogized Václav Havel , the playwright turned dissident turned peaceful revolutionary turned president who had just died , than two subsequent news stories set Havel ’ s extraordinary career in context : the death of Kim Jong-il , North Korea ’ s pornography-addicted and nuclear-armed supreme leader , and the peaceful protests against land expropriation by the villagers of Wukan in Guandong province , southern China .
Kim , in a sense , was the anti-Havel , lacking not only moral scruples , but even the usual dictatorial concern for how a country is managed . his death made me recall that of Mao Zedong , with all the mass hysteria – real and feigned – that accompanies the demise of a self-anointed god .
because he had no son to succeed him , Mao appointed a five-person politburo to do the job . its members , which included his nephew , Mao Yuanxin , his mistress , Zhang Yufeng , and Jiang Qing , his last wife – were as incompetent at governing as Kim , but , following the disaster of the Cultural Revolution , antagonism to them in the military and other state institutions was too widespread for them to last .
North Korea ’ s bad luck is that , despite his incompetence , Kim Jong-il seems to have managed to bequeath the dynasty he inherited to his youngest son , Kim Jong-un . given other North Korean institutions ’ apparent indifference to the mess that the Kims have made of their country , there seems scant chance of any serious change of course being initiated from within .
fortunately for Havel , Czechoslovakia ’ s small-minded communist rulers were also small-minded in their lies . but when every aspect of society is built , as in North Korea , on a Big Lie , and then an Even Bigger Lie , it is probably hard to maintain one ’ s sanity , let alone the ability to live in truth .
communism , thanks to the lure of successful market economies and the example set by people like Havel , has put the system under such external strain that Kim III has nowhere to turn for effective help . indeed , even the two regimes most eager to maintain the Kim dynasty – China ’ s and Russia ’ s – are feeling pressure from their disaffected but , it now seems , not-so-powerless populations .
in Wukan , simple villagers were unafraid to challenge the might of the local party and police when officials stole their land for a development project . in Henan , policemen have gone into the streets demanding that human rights be protected .
following the sham elections in early December , massive protests erupted in Moscow and Saint Petersburg . and those marching were not the usual impoverished rabble-rousers , but Russia ’ s new middle classes .
and recall that it was indifference to the non-reforming East European communist regimes on the part of Mikhail Gorbachev and the Soviet Union that ultimately sealed &amp; # 160 ; their fate and delivered Havel from a prison cell to Prague Castle . Havel , of course , was a beneficiary of such indifference , but he never practiced it , remaining a fighter for truth and freedom throughout his life .
for Chinese concerned about how to live in truth , Havel remains our exemplar . the Charter 77 movement that he founded provided the template for men like the imprisoned Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo , who helped to found Charter 08 , which proclaimed that Chinese , too , could live in dignity and freedom .
Kim Jong-il ’ s demise reminds us that all people are equal before death . Havel ’ s passing reminds us that the value of life will eventually gain respect .
the Power to End Poverty
I lived it . one of my earliest memories is walking up a muddy track into the mountains to escape the fighting , my village burning behind me and wondering what would happen to my family and me .
with the help of many countries and friends , my country was able to get back on its feet and carry on after that terrible and devastating conflict . thanks to decades of hard work and sacrifice by millions of Koreans , the Republic of Korea rose from desperate poverty to prosperity in less than a half-century .
as Secretary-General of the UN , I am still living that story . every day , I work to help end the extreme poverty that traps nearly a billion of the world ’ s people .
as in my youth , I saw once again the challenges and hardship of rural poverty . yet I also saw , once again , the power of community spirit to overcome it – the same sense of solidarity and determination that launched Korea ’ s rural modernization five decades ago .
these targets , endorsed by all UN member countries , comprise the eight Millennium Development Goals . the Millennium Village Project , a partnership of academia , business , and UN agencies , aims to show how these goals can be achieved in even the poorest communities in the world .
like South Korea ’ s own experience in fighting poverty , Millennium Villages in Africa , and similar projects elsewhere , are now surging ahead in food production , children ’ s health , and in forging a sustainable pathway out of poverty itself . at the same time , I was impressed with one crucial difference between Korea ’ s efforts in the 1960 ’ s and what is possible today .
in a community that once could not feed itself , a giant warehouse was almost bursting with tons of surplus grain . by using high-yield seeds , better soil management , and proper row planting , the community has more than tripled its crop production , and villagers who previously were hungry grain buyers are now food-secure grain sellers .
that surplus , in turn , has contributed directly to improved education , as families donate a portion of their surplus to the school ’ s mid-day meal program . now the students get a nutritious bowl of porridge and fruits , giving them the energy to pursue their studies throughout the school day .
this month , the Millennium Villages Project launches its second five-year stage on the way to the MDGs target date of 2015 . around Africa , and now around the world , governments are scaling up the lessons from this particular project and others like it : empower communities , help them to invest in their futures using cutting-edge technologies , and thereby end extreme poverty .
the world leaders who met at the UN in September for the annual General Debate all agreed on a central point : the importance of fighting poverty , hunger , and disease is crucial for our collective survival . they know that extreme poverty threatens the lives of hundreds of millions of people who lack reliable access to adequate nutrition , potable water , health care , and education .
they also know that the dangers don ’ t stop at the edge of the village or slum ; today ’ s hunger hotspots all too frequently become tomorrow ’ s violent hotspots . regardless of whether we are rich , poor , or in between , we share an overwhelming interest in the MDGs ’ success , so that every region trapped in extreme poverty can break free , grow , and prosper .
austere Illusions
in 1930 , US President Herbert Hoover was advised by his treasury secretary , Andrew Mellon : “ Liquidate labor , liquidate stocks , liquidate the farmers , liquidate real estate . it will purge the rottenness out of the system ... People will ... live a more moral life ... and enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people . ”
to “ liquidationists ” of Mellon ’ s ilk , the pre-2008 economy was full of cancerous growths – in banking , in housing , in equities – which need to be cut out before health can be restored . their position is clear : the state is a parasite , sucking the lifeblood of free enterprise .
this was the point of his famous remark , “ In the long run we are all dead . ” Economies , Keynes believed , can become stuck in prolonged periods of “ under-employment equilibrium ” ; in such cases , an external stimulus of some kind is needed to jolt them back to higher employment .
what is true of the parts is not true of the whole . if all of Europe is cutting , the United Kingdom cannot grow ; if the entire world is cutting , global growth will stop .
a government cannot liquidate its deficit if the source of its revenues , the national income , is diminishing . it is deficit reduction , not debt , that is profligate , because it implies wastage of available human and physical capital , quite apart from the resulting misery .
the pro-austerity argument is pure assertion , but it is meant to be a testable assertion , so econometricians have been busy trying to prove that the less the government spends , the faster the economy will grow . indeed , just a year or two ago , “ expansionary fiscal contraction ” was all the rage , and a massive research effort went into proving its existence .
for example , “ an increase in government size by ten percentage points is associated with a 0.5-1 % lower annual growth rate . ” In April 2010 , the leader of this school , Harvard University ’ s Alberto Alesina , assured European finance ministers that “ even sharp reductions of budget deficits have been accompanied and immediately followed by sustained growth rather than recessions even in the very short run . ”
first , because the cuts had to be “ credible ” – that is , large and decisive – the continuing absence of growth could be blamed on the insufficiency of the cuts . thus , Europe ’ s failure to recover “ immediately ” has been due to a lack of austerity , even though public-sector retrenchment has been unprecedented .
if you find a correlation between deficit reduction and growth , the reduction could be causing the growth or vice versa . ( or both the deficit reduction and the growth could be due to something else – devaluation or higher exports , for example . )
an International Monetary Fund paper in 2012 brought Alesina ’ s hour of glory to an end . going through the same material as Alesina had , its authors pointed out that “ while it is plausible to conjecture that confidence effects have been at play in our sample of consolidations , during downturns they do not seem to have ever been strong enough to make the consolidations expansionary . ”
on this foundation of zombie economics and slipshod research rests the case for austerity . in fact , the austerity boosters in the UK and Europe frequently cited the Alesina and Reinhart / Rogoff findings .
the results of austerity have been what any Keynesian would have expected : hardly any growth in the UK and the eurozone in the last two and a half years , and huge declines in some countries ; little reduction in public deficits , despite large spending cuts ; and higher national debts .
first , prolonged unemployment destroys not just current but also potential output by eroding the “ human capital ” of the unemployed . second , austerity policies have hit those at the bottom of the income distribution far more severely than those at the top , simply because those at the top rely much less on government services .
so we will remain in a state of “ under-employment equilibrium ” until policy in the UK and the eurozone is changed ( and assuming that policy in the US does not become worse ) . in the face of clamor from the right to cut even more savagely , statesmen who are too timid to increase public spending would be wise to ignore their advice .
after Ahmadinejad
the disqualification of both sends a strong message from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei . simply put , Khamenei will not tolerate any diminution of his power , and he is determined to avoid the type of friction that has characterized his relationships with previous presidents , particularly Ahmadinejad .
the disqualification of Mashai and Rafsanjani reveals , once again , the schism embedded at the heart of Iran ’ s political structure by the dual executive of Supreme Leader and President . when Khamenei publicly supported Ahmadinejad ’ s controversial reelection in 2009 , no one could have predicted the unprecedented tensions that would subsequently emerge between the country ’ s two main authorities .
but supporting Ahmadinejad turned out to be a costly decision for Khamenei – and for the Islamic Republic . instead of aligning himself with Khamenei , as expected , Ahmadinejad began to promote a nationalist , anti-clerical agenda , effectively using Khamenei ’ s resources to challenge the supreme leader ’ s authority and to establish his own economic network and sphere of influence .
over the last four years , Ahmadinejad has repeatedly tried to undermine the ruling clerics ’ control over political and policy decisions . in 2011 , he attempted to dismiss Heider Moslehi , an ally of Khamenei , from his position as intelligence chief , but was quickly overruled .
but , as the rift between Khamenei and Ahmadinejad has grown , support for the president has declined significantly , with even state-run media referring to Ahmadinejad ’ s loyalists as a “ deviation circle . ” Moreover , unlike during Ahmadinejad ’ s first term , non-state media now publicly criticize his economic and political agenda .
with the end of Ahmadinejad ’ s second and final term fast approaching , it seems unlikely that the disgraced , unpopular president will abandon his efforts to destabilize Iran ’ s ruling establishment . in fact , he had long promoted Mashai as his successor , but Khamenei curtailed his illegal efforts – and has now put a stop to Mashai ’ s candidacy altogether .
Mashai is among Iran ’ s most controversial figures , widely reviled among conservative leaders for his reformist , anti-clerical views . in 2009 , after Khamenei rejected Ahmadinejad ’ s decision to appoint Mashai as his first deputy , Ahmadinejad brazenly appointed him Chief of Staff , a move that infuriated Khamenei .
Ahmadinejad is not the first high-ranking official in Iran to challenge the supreme leader . grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri , one of Iran ’ s most senior clerics , would have been Supreme Leader himself had he not fallen out with Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the Islamic Republic ’ s founder , a few months before Khomeini ’ s death .
one of the most influential figures in Iran during the Republic ’ s first decade , Montazeri provided an extensive justification for the supreme leader ’ s absolute authority , which many ayatollahs considered heretical . but he soon began to challenge the Islamic Republic ’ s hardline leadership – and continued to do so until he died in 2009 .
likewise , Abulhassan Banisadr , the Islamic Republic ’ s first president , fell out with Khomeini over the division of authority . he was impeached in 1981 , after only a year in power , and fled to France , where he continues to reside .
both were relatively unknown before their presidencies ; both depended on the supreme leader ’ s backing to gain power ; and both gradually lost support as they attempted to reduce the influence of the clerical hierarchy and the IRGC . most important , both failed to create an external organization on which they could rely if their official protection failed .
the fact that Ahmadinejad has been allowed to serve out his entire second term – an outcome that the media often doubted – reflects the importance to Khamenei of maintaining an image of a stable Iran . but achieving that goal will require Khamenei to account for Ahmadinejad ’ s unpredictability .
with nothing to lose , Ahmadinejad could decide to destabilize the Islamic Republic if he considers it necessary for his survival . indeed , now that the Guardian Council has disqualified Mashai from the presidential race , Ahmadinejad ’ s resentment will probably manifest itself in behavior before and after the election , such as releasing information on high-level corruption .
after the election , the kind of factional disputes that have long paralyzed policymaking in Iran will likely persist . but stalemate over Iran ’ s nuclear policy could have serious consequences .
the Press versus Privacy
the “ right to privacy ” is enshrined in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights , and guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights . but Article 8 is balanced by Article 10 , which guarantees “ free expression of opinion . ”
under what circumstances , for example , is it right to curtail press freedom in order to protect the right to privacy , or vice versa ? the same balance is being sought between the right of citizens to data privacy and government demands for access to personal information to fight crime , terrorism , and so on .
it is a necessary protection against abuses of power and cover-ups of wrongdoing by public officials . it was never more effectively displayed than in the Watergate investigation , which brought down Richard Nixon in 1974 .
so it is no surprise that press freedom is the freedom that authoritarian governments are keenest to curtail . indeed , provided they can sufficiently muzzle the media they can even allow ( relatively ) free elections , as in Putin ’ s Russia .
he rejected the News of the World ’ s “ public interest ” defense , because he found no evidence that the sadomasochistic party had a “ Nazi theme . ” This implies that had there been a Nazi theme , it could have been legitimate to publish it , given Mosley ’ s position as FIA president .
what Eady ’ s judgment did accomplish was to highlight the crucial distinction , necessary for all clear thinking about privacy , between what interests the public and what is in the public interest . so how can this distinction be made effective ?
there is a natural fear that specific legislation designed to protect privacy would muzzle legitimate press inquiries . at the same time , it is widely acknowledged ( except by most editors and journalists ) that a great deal of media intrusion is simply an abuse of press freedom , with the sole aim of boosting circulation by feeding public prurience .
a law that curtails the abuse of press power while protecting its freedom to expose the abuse of political power would be difficult , but not impossible , to frame . the essential principle is that the media should not be allowed to pander to the public ’ s prurience under cover of protecting the public interest .
thus , a pop star ’ s consumption of illegal drugs may be reported , but not his or her sexual habits ( if they are legal ) . the private life of a politician may be revealed if it is expected to have consequences for the way the country is being governed ; that of a top executive of a public company if it may affect the returns to shareholders .
this should be the only “ public interest ” defense available to a media outlet that is sued for invasion of privacy . the media might become a bit drearier , but public life would be far healthier .
the Price of 9 / 11
new YORK – The September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks by Al Qaeda were meant to harm the United States , and they did , but in ways that Osama bin Laden probably never imagined . President George W. Bush ’ s response to the attacks compromised America ’ s basic principles , undermined its economy , and weakened its security .
the attack on Afghanistan that followed the 9 / 11 attacks was understandable , but the subsequent invasion of Iraq was entirely unconnected to Al Qaeda – as much as Bush tried to establish a link . that war of choice quickly became very expensive – orders of magnitude beyond the $ 60 billion claimed at the beginning – as colossal incompetence met dishonest misrepresentation .
with almost 50 % of returning troops eligible to receive some level of disability payment , and more than 600,000 treated so far in veterans ’ medical facilities , we now estimate that future disability payments and health-care costs will total $ 600-900 billion . but the social costs , reflected in veteran suicides ( which have topped 18 per day in recent years ) and family breakups , are incalculable .
even if Bush could be forgiven for taking America , and much of the rest of the world , to war on false pretenses , and for misrepresenting the cost of the venture , there is no excuse for how he chose to finance it . his was the first war in history paid for entirely on credit .
increased defense spending , together with the Bush tax cuts , is a key reason why America went from a fiscal surplus of 2 % of GDP when Bush was elected to its parlous deficit and debt position today . direct government spending on those wars so far amounts to roughly $ 2 trillion – $ 17,000 for every US household – with bills yet to be received increasing this amount by more than 50 % .
moreover , as Bilmes and I argued in our book The Three Trillion Dollar War , the wars contributed to America ’ s macroeconomic weaknesses , which exacerbated its deficits and debt burden . then , as now , disruption in the Middle East led to higher oil prices , forcing Americans to spend money on oil imports that they otherwise could have spent buying goods produced in the US .
but then the US Federal Reserve hid these weaknesses by engineering a housing bubble that led to a consumption boom . it will take years to overcome the excessive indebtedness and real-estate overhang that resulted .
an unpopular war would have made military recruitment difficult in any circumstances . but , as Bush tried to deceive America about the wars ’ costs , he underfunded the troops , refusing even basic expenditures – say , for armored and mine-resistant vehicles needed to protect American lives , or for adequate health care for returning veterans .
but America ’ s real strength , more than its military and economic power , is its “ soft power , ” its moral authority . and this , too , was weakened : as the US violated basic human rights like habeas corpus and the right not to be tortured , its longstanding commitment to international law was called into question .
the wars ’ collateral damage has been massive : by some accounts , more than a million Iraqis have died , directly or indirectly , because of the war . according to some studies , at least 137,000 civilians have died violently in Afghanistan and Iraq in the last ten years ; among Iraqis alone , there are 1.8 million refugees and 1.7 million internally displaced people .
America ’ s military spending still nearly equals that of the rest of the world combined , two decades after the end of the Cold War . some of the increased expenditures went to the costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the broader Global War on Terrorism , but much of it was wasted on weapons that don ’ t work against enemies that don ’ t exist .
Al Qaeda , while not conquered , no longer appears to be the threat that loomed so large in the wake of the 9 / 11 attacks . but the price paid in getting to this point , in the US and elsewhere , has been enormous – and mostly avoidable .
the Price of Inaction
Berkeley – Are the world ’ s governments capable of keeping the world economy out of a deep and long depression ? three months ago , I would have said yes , without question .
the problem is not that governments are unsure about what to do . the standard checklist of what to do in a financial crisis to avoid a deep and prolonged depression has been gradually worked out over two centuries : by Bank of England Governor Cornelius Buller in 1825 ; by the Victorian-era editor of The Economist , Walter Bagehot ; and by the economists Irving Fisher , John Maynard Keynes , Milton Friedman , among many others .
the key problem in times like these is that investor demand for safe , secure , and liquid assets – and thus their value – is too high , while demand for assets that underpin and finance the economy ’ s productive capital is too low . the obvious solution is for governments to create more cash to satisfy the demand for safe , secure , liquid assets .
“ Men cannot be employed when the object of desire &#91; i.e. , money &#93; is something which cannot be produced and the demand for which cannot readily be choked off . ” The solution is “ to persuade the public that green cheese &#91; i.e. , the notes printed by the central bank &#93; is practically the same thing and to have a green cheese factory &#91; i.e. a central bank &#93; under public control ... ”
when there is no excess demand for cash , there will be no excess supply of the bonds and stocks that underpin and finance the economy ’ s productive capital . thus , expansionary monetary policy via standard open-market operations by a central bank is the first item on the checklist of what to do in a financial crisis .
the problem comes when expansionary monetary policy via standard open-market operations and central-bank guarantees of orderly markets prove insufficient . economists disagree about when , under what circumstances , and in what order governments should move beyond these first two items on the checklist .
should they explicitly guarantee large financial institutions ’ liabilities and / or classes of assets ? should they buy up assets at what they believe is a discount from their long-run values , or buy up assets that private investors are unwilling to trade , even at a premium above their likely long-run values ?
three months ago , I said that there was considerable disagreement about these issues , but that two things were certain . first , we do not know enough about when , under what circumstances , and in what order governments should resort to these checklist items .
second , trying a combination of these items – even a confused and haphazard combination – was better than doing nothing . all five of the world ’ s major economies implemented their own confused and haphazard combinations of monetary , fiscal , and banking stimulus policies during the Great Depression , and the sooner they did – the sooner each began its own New Deal – the better .
there is an 80 % chance that waiting until 2010 and seeing what policies look appropriate then would not be disastrous . but that means that there is a 20 % chance that it would be .
the Price of Inequality
new YORK – America likes to think of itself as a land of opportunity , and others view it in much the same light . but , while we can all think of examples of Americans who rose to the top on their own , what really matters are the statistics : to what extent do an individual ’ s life chances depend on the income and education of his or her parents ?
nowadays , these numbers show that the American dream is a myth . there is less equality of opportunity in the United States today than there is in Europe – or , indeed , in any advanced industrial country for which there are data .
this is one of the reasons that America has the highest level of inequality of any of the advanced countries – &amp; nbsp ; and its gap with the rest has been widening . in the “ recovery ” of 2009-2010 , the top 1 % of US income earners captured 93 % of the income growth .
it would be one thing if the high incomes of those at the top were the result of greater contributions to society , but the Great Recession showed otherwise : even bankers who had led the global economy , as well as their own firms , to the brink of ruin , received outsize bonuses .
likewise , part of the wealth of those in finance comes from exploiting the poor , through predatory lending and abusive credit-card practices . those at the top , in such cases , are enriched at the direct expense of those at the bottom .
it might not be so bad if there were even a grain of truth to trickle-down economics – the quaint notion that everyone benefits from enriching those at the top . but most Americans today are worse off – with lower real ( inflation-adjusted ) incomes – than they were in 1997 , a decade and a half ago .
defenders of America ’ s inequality argue that the poor and those in the middle shouldn ’ t complain . while they may be getting a smaller share of the pie than they did in the past , the pie is growing so much , thanks to the contributions of the rich and superrich , that the size of their slice is actually larger .
rent-seeking distorts the economy . market forces , of course , play a role , too , but markets are shaped by politics ; and , in America , with its quasi-corrupt system of campaign finance and its revolving doors between government and industry , politics is shaped by money .
for example , a bankruptcy law that privileges derivatives over all else , but does not allow the discharge of student debt , no matter how inadequate the education provided , enriches bankers and impoverishes many at the bottom . in a country where money trumps democracy , such legislation has become predictably frequent .
but growing inequality is not inevitable . there are market economies that are doing better , both in terms of both GDP growth and rising living standards for most citizens .
many at the bottom , or even in the middle , are not living up to their potential , because the rich , needing few public services and worried that a strong government might redistribute income , use their political influence to cut taxes and curtail government spending . this leads to underinvestment in infrastructure , education , and technology , impeding the engines of growth .
the Great Recession has exacerbated inequality , with cutbacks in basic social expenditures and with high unemployment putting downward pressure on wages . moreover , the United Nations Commission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System , investigating the causes of the Great Recession , and the International Monetary Fund have both warned that inequality leads to economic instability .
but , most importantly , America ’ s inequality is undermining its values and identity . with inequality reaching such extremes , it is not surprising that its effects are manifest in every public decision , from the conduct of monetary policy to budgetary allocations .
America can no longer regard itself as the land of opportunity that it once was . but it does not have to be this way : it is not too late for the American dream to be restored .
the Primacy of NATO
F OR PUBLICATION FEBRUARY 22 , NOT BEFORE
today , 26 NATO Heads of State and Government will meet at NATO Headquarters in Brussels . they are here to demonstrate a strong spirit of unity in the transatlantic community , a determination to look forward and take action together .
there are important questions to be addressed , not only about the direction of NATO ’ s missions and operations , but also about the future of transatlantic security cooperation and the role the Alliance will play .
the broad range of issues to be discussed mirrors the essential place of the Alliance in addressing today ’ s security challenges .
they will discuss how to reinforce the success the international community has had in helping to build a new , democratic Afghanistan . NATO and its members are already providing the essential security Afghanistan needs in order to make its aspirations for self-sustaining peace and prosperity a reality .
Iraq is a case in point . all 26 NATO nations are now , as an Alliance , working together to respond to the Iraqi government ’ s request for support : by training Iraqi security forces , by providing equipment , or by helping to fund NATO ’ s efforts .
already , the Alliance is developing a deeper political dialogue and more practical cooperation with the countries of North Africa , Israel and Jordan , and opening up a discussion with the Gulf States . when Dr. Rice made her first visit as Secretary of State to NATO headquarters two weeks ago , Alliance Foreign Ministers had a discussion about the Middle East Peace Process .
in that regard , this morning NATO leaders will welcome their first meeting with President Yushchenko . they will share with him their common determination to help him build a better , more democratic future for his people , and strengthen Ukraine ’ s Euro-Atlantic integration .
but NATO leaders will also lift their eyes from the immediate challenges of the day , and discuss a fundamental strategic question as well : how to use NATO to its fullest potential as a platform for holding political discussions and building transatlantic consensus across the wide range of the issues where Europe and North America share common interests and wish to defend common values .
NATO is the only permanent political forum in which North America sits together with Europe . this is a unique framework for profound transatlantic political consultation and effective military cooperation .
indeed , as we face today ’ s security challenges - terrorism , proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , failed states - we cannot afford not to . I am encouraged that , more and more , Alliance leaders are coming to share the same view .
today ’ s Summit meeting will give a new impulse to NATO ’ s political evolution . that evolution will accelerate in the coming months and years , as NATO ’ s strengthens its role in shaping and delivering transatlantic security cooperation in the 21st century .
capitalists for Inclusive Growth
London – In 2012 , the Pew Research Center found that 85 % of self-described middle-class adults in the United States believe that it is more difficult now than it was a decade ago for people like them to maintain their standard of living . the share of Americans who say that they are in the lower-middle or lower class has risen from a quarter of the adult population in 2008 to around a third today .
indeed , in January , the IMF revised its near-term outlook for eurozone growth downward , to -0.2 % in 2013 . meanwhile , official data from Spain indicate that the jobless rate rose to 26 % ( almost six million people ) in the last three months of 2012 , the highest figure since the mid-1970 ’ s , with the rate of youth unemployment reaching 55 % .
the need for growth – specifically , the kind of inclusive growth that can provide jobs for the vast number of out-of-work young people and combat rising levels of income inequality – has never been more vital . nevertheless , today ’ s debates about how to achieve sustainable , inclusive growth are too narrowly focused on the role of governments and policymakers .
companies like Rolls-Royce and British Gas operate impressive apprenticeship schemes that add value for their businesses by creating a pipeline of talented recruits . other initiatives have been established to scale up these efforts by engaging multiple companies to create entry-level positions for the significant number of young people who are currently unemployed .
second , just as a collective effort is needed to strengthen the skills of national workforces , so , too , an industry commitment is required to support small and medium-size enterprises ( SMEs ) as part of the wider business environment . in its 2011 fiscal year , Hewlett-Packard used more than 600 SMEs in its supply chain in the United Kingdom , representing nearly 10 % of its spending on suppliers .
similarly , in March 2012 , a consortium of large corporations led by IBM created the web-based Supplier Connection to make it easier for small businesses to become suppliers to large companies . currently , the members of Supplier Connection purchase more than $ 150 billion in goods and services annually through their global supply chains .
finally , public corporations must be managed for the long term , and should be rewarded by investors for being more inclusive . for example , Unilever has rejected the short-term pressures of capital markets by ending quarterly earnings reporting and broadening its focus to advance greater social interests , rather than just the interests of its shareholders .
but enlightened companies require enlightened investors . the Ontario Teachers ’ Pension Plan is exemplary in its commitment to supporting the best governance practices in the companies in which it invests , and it has reaped large benefits from this approach : the Plan has earned average annual returns of 10 % since its inception in 1990 .
the idea that underlies all of these initiatives , and the notion of inclusive capitalism itself , is that companies must be managed for the long term . companies that follow this approach are concerned with the skills of their future workforces ; seek to build loyal and productive supplier bases ; and make investment decisions based on sustainable value creation , not short-term profitability .
there is no contradiction between delivering high returns and adopting a long-term approach . furthermore , as companies begin to adopt these practices , a rising tide will lift all boats : with greater support , SMEs , which currently account for 99 % of businesses and two-thirds of private-sector employment in the European Union , will be able to invest in research and development , and to hire more employees .
in turn , large companies will receive the benefits of faster innovation , rates of youth unemployment will fall , and the hollowing out of the middle class – and its faith in future living standards – will be reversed . it is this type of profoundly positive influence on prospects for shared prosperity and inclusive growth that currently eludes national governments .
the Problem with “ China Bashing ”
back then , “ Japan bashing ” came to mean the threat of US trade sanctions unless Japan softened competitive pressure on American industries . by 1995 , the Japanese economy had become so depressed by the overvalued yen ( endaka fukyo ) that the Americans relented and an &amp; shy ; nounced a new “ strong dollar ” policy .
by 2000 , China ’ s bilateral trade surplus was as large as Japan ’ s ; by 2004 , it was twice as large . whereas Japan bashing included “ vol &amp; shy ; untary ” restraints on exports that threatened US heavy industries , where lobbies were concentrated and politically potent , recent Chinese exports have mainly been low- to middle-tech products of light industry .
the financial press and many influential economists argue that a major de &amp; shy ; preciation of the dollar is needed to correct America ’ s external deficit . but the US current-account deficit – about 6 % of GDP in 2004 and 2005 – mainly reflects a new round of deficit spending by the US federal government and surprisingly low personal savings by American households ( perhaps because of the bubble in US residential real estate ) .
moreover , the cure can be worse than the disease . sustained appreciation of a creditor country ’ s currency against the world ’ s dominant money is a recipe for a slowdown in economic growth , followed by eventual deflation , as Japan found in the 1990 ’ s – with no obvious decline in its large relative trade surplus .
if a discrete exchange-rate appreciation is to be sustained , it must reflect expected monetary policies : tight money and deflation in the appreciated country , and easy money with inflation in the depreciated country . but domestic money growth in China ’ s immature bank-based capital market is high and unpredictable , while many interest rates remain officially pegged .
from 1995 to July 21 , 2005 , China ’ s authorities held the now unified exchange rate constant at 8.28 yuan / dollar ( plus or minus 0.3 % ) . they subordinated domestic monetary and fiscal policies to maintaining the fixed exchange rate – even during the 1997-98 Asian crisis , despite great pressure to devalue .
greater economic openness , coupled with the fixed nominal exchange rate , ended China ’ s inflationary roller-coaster ride , and , after 1994 , real GDP growth also became more stable . the government is now seeking to decontrol domestic interest rates , create a more robust domestic bond market , and finally remove capital controls .
in a liberalized capital market , the undiminished risk that the yuan might appreciate means that investors must be compensated by a higher interest rate on dollar assets . but interest rates on dollar assets are given in world markets independently of what China does .
as the huge buildup of dollar reserves – now almost $ 800 billion – expands China ’ s domestic monetary base , short-term interest rates will be driven down , at least until they hit zero . in May 2006 , the fairly free domestic interbank rate was just 1.62 % , while the US Federal Funds rate was 5 % .
actual appreciation would lead to actual deflation and further downward pressure on domestic interest rates . if actual appreciation does not reduce China ’ s trade surplus , pressure to appreciate the yuan further would only continue , as was true for Japan before 1995 .
if China is to avoid falling into a Japanese-style liquidity trap , the best solution is to fix its exchange rate in a completely credible way so that there is no fear of currency appreciation . then financial liberalization could proceed with market interest rates remaining at normal levels .
failing this , China must postpone full liberalization of its financial markets . this means retaining , and possibly strengthening , capital controls on inflows of highly liquid “ hot ” money from dollars into yuan , and continuing to peg certain interest rates , such as basic deposit and loan rates , to help preserve the profitability of banks .
true , China ’ s economy is now growing robustly and is not likely to face actual deflation anytime soon , but if China does fall into a zero-interest rate trap , the PBC , like the BOJ , would be unable to offset deflationary pressure in the event of a large exchange-rate appreciation . with short-term interest rates locked at zero , pressure for further appreciation would leave the PBC helpless to re-expand the economy .
China ’ s monetary and foreign exchange policies are now in a state of limbo . instead of stable guidelines with a well-defined monetary ( exchange rate ) anchor and a firm mandate to complete financial liberalization , China ’ s macroeconomic and financial decision making will be ad hoc and anybody ’ s guess – as was true , and still is , for Japan .
learning from Lehman
Hong KONG – When the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed five years ago , emerging-market economies did not hold many of the toxic financial assets – mainly American subprime mortgages – that fueled the subsequent global financial crisis . but they were deeply affected by the drop in world trade , which recorded a peak-to-trough decline of at least 15 % , with trade finance also contracting sharply , owing to a shortage of dollar liquidity .
China ’ s ¥ 4 trillion stimulus package , unveiled in November 2008 , restored confidence in global commodity markets . led by strong Chinese growth , emerging markets stabilized .
since 2009 , quantitative easing ( QE ) by the US Federal Reserve has resulted in record-low interest rates around the world . but , while the resulting surge in capital flows to emerging markets stimulated economic growth , it also inflated asset bubbles .
now , with the Fed publicly considering an end to its massive , open-ended purchases of long-term securities and foreign capital fleeing home from emerging markets , many fear that Asia ’ s economies could come crashing down , as they did in the late 1990 ’ s . leverage in some emerging markets ’ household and corporate sectors has reached record levels .
China ’ s renminbi is internationalizing , but its share of global payments remains relatively small , with the dollar retaining its role as the world ’ s main reserve currency . and , while regulatory reform is progressing , its effectiveness in addressing the weaknesses exposed by the global financial crisis will depend not only on the new rules that emerge , but also on the consistency and quality of their implementation .
there has been commendable progress on the Basel 3 capital requirements for banks , with 25 of 27 Basel Committee members having issued final rules . likewise , the impact of regulatory changes resulting from major legislation and policy directives in the United States , Europe , and the United Kingdom on banking , insurance , financial-transaction taxes , anti-money laundering , and cyber-space is likely to be substantial .
although rules on shadow-banking have yet to be formulated , another problem exposed by the crisis has abated : America ’ s external deficit has shrunk to a much more manageable 2-3 % of GDP , accompanied by drops in the surpluses run by Japan and China . global trade rebalancing has arrived .
still , fiscal conditions in the advanced economies remain unsustainable , with many OECD members ’ debt levels hovering around 100 % of GDP . Japan , which has one of the world ’ s highest debt / GDP ratios , currently well over 200 % , is engaging in a risky experiment with further monetary stimulus to try to target 2 % annual inflation .
the key questions now are whether global economic growth is self-sustaining without QE , whether emerging markets ’ output will continue to rise strongly , albeit at a slower pace , and whether current global financial-reform efforts will be sufficient to prevent another crisis in emerging markets .
given the high degree of trade and financial globalization that now characterizes the world economy , there is no doubt that the slowdown in the advanced economies , which account for two-thirds of global GDP , will undermine emerging-country growth . indeed , the threat to withdraw QE is already having an enormous impact on emerging economies ’ asset markets .
in the coming years , emerging markets will most likely struggle with implementation of global financial regulatory standards , which apply mostly to more sophisticated financial markets . they will also confront a rapidly changing external environment and a growing need to manage capital flows more effectively , which will require much closer coordination between central banks and financial regulators .
indeed , perhaps the most important lesson learned in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers is that we can no longer afford to examine problems in terms of individual institutions and from regulatory “ silos . ” The global economy ’ s high degree of interconnectivity , interdependence , and complex feedback mechanisms imply that one weak hub can bring down the entire system .
in other words , the world needs a systemic approach to deal with systemic risks and system failures . unfortunately , there may be little hope of strengthening global financial governance as long as implementation and enforcement of rules remain at the national level .
China was one of the first countries to sign up to the Basel 3 standards , and further renminbi internationalization will be implemented in a prudent and pragmatic manner . domestic financial reforms will focus on strengthening policy coordination and moving toward market-determined interest rates and exchange-rate flexibility .
all of these steps will contribute to sustainable domestic growth and a more stable global financial system . other major emerging economies ’ policymakers would be wise to act with the same purpose in mind .

the Promise of Central Asia
central Asia is frequently in the news these days – and most of the news seems to be bad . the casual reader , viewer , and listener has become acquainted with a region of landlocked and poor countries – Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , and Uzbekistan – that share a legacy of isolation , squandered natural resources , environmental degradation , and Soviet-era political systems .
and yet , it is also a region with a distant history of great economic and cultural achievement in the Silk Road era , and that recently has emerged as a focus of renewed global competition reminiscent of the Cold War . can Central Asia regain a key role at the center of the huge Eurasian landmass , surrounded by some of the world ’ s most dynamic economies – China , Russia , and India ?
while there is a laudable international effort to help Africa grow out of heavy donor dependency in the next decade , the equally momentous economic-development and human-security challenges facing Central Asia is generally not fully understood . history and geography – measured by distance from the closest seaports – have isolated these countries physically , economically , and socially , and have exacerbated the difficulties of their transitions to market economies .
this will require them to open up to the rest of the world , cooperate with each other and their neighbors , and radically reform their antiquated political systems .
regional cooperation should include areas ranging from trade , transport , and transit , to water and energy , as well as efforts to control of drug trafficking . the Report estimates that by doing so , and by improving their investment climates and governance , Central Asian countries can double their incomes over ten years , modernize their economies , connect with the rest of the world , and improve the lives of their citizens dramatically .
trade times and costs are unnaturally high due to unintegrated and lengthy border procedures , high tariff rates , corruption , and underinvestment in transport infrastructure . these costs could be halved by better customs , border and transit management , improved transport corridors and more competitive transport services .
the region is poised to become one of the main suppliers of oil and gas for world energy markets , and its big rivers , if properly managed , have the capacity to provide enough water both for irrigation and for electricity exports to China , India , and Russia . but cooperation is needed both within the region and with key neighbors in order to realize effective regional water and energy management .
up to 100 tons of heroin are estimated to pass through Tajikistan each year , which is equivalent to the estimated annual North American and West European demand . unless Central Asian countries and their neighbors cooperate in controlling drug production , use , and trafficking , this source of major health risks , corruption , and crime will not be eradicated .
the good news today is that most of the Central Asian countries , their neighbors and the international community have recognized the importance of cooperation , openness , and integration . Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , and Tajikistan are actively opening up and working together on many fronts .
market-oriented reforms and good governance are preconditions for effective cross-border ties . the international community , which has a shared interest in a prosperous , stable , and cohesive Central Asia , can and should play a supporting role in these efforts .
the Promise of Euro-Atlantic Missile Defense
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery is a threat to both the NATO allies and Russia . a look at current trends shows that more than 30 countries have or are developing missile capabilities .
Iran also has an extensive missile development program . &amp; nbsp ; Iranian officials declare that the range of their modified Shahab-3 missiles is 2,000 kilometers , putting Allied countries such as Turkey , Greece , Romania , and Bulgaria within reach .
this is a key stage in the development of intermediate- and intercontinental-range missiles . if Iran completes this development , the whole of Europe , as well as all of Russia , would be within its range .
proliferators must know that the NATO allies are unwavering in their commitment to collective defense , including nuclear deterrence . confronted with the spread of missile technology , and unpredictable regimes and leaders , we owe it to our populations to complement our deterrence capabilities with an effective missile-defense capability .
NATO itself is developing protections for our deployed troops . but with the new US approach to missile defense , there are now much better opportunities for an effective NATO-wide system that would enhance the territorial defense of our populations and nations .
but there is another reason for developing missile defense : to create a new dynamic in European and Euro-Atlantic security . there is &amp; nbsp ; much talk these days about the Euro-Atlantic security architecture .
we should look for common political approaches , many of which we have already agreed , and could easily endorse again . but , to my mind , a joint security architecture must move beyond blueprints .
in this respect , the news that the US and Russia have agreed on a follow-up treaty to START that will substantially cut both countries ’ nuclear arsenals provides a good backdrop . this new agreement makes the world safer , and it will give impetus to cooperation with Russia in other fields , particularly NATO-Russia relations .
since taking office last summer , I have invested considerable time and effort in revitalizing the NATO-Russia relationship , with progress made in several areas , including a joint review of common threats and challenges . but it is time to look at missile defense as another opportunity to bring us together .
the more that missile defense is seen as a shared security roof – built , supported , and operated together – that protects us all , the more people from Vancouver to Vladivostok will know that they are part of one community . such a security roof would be a strong political symbol that Russia is fully part of the Euro-Atlantic family , sharing the costs and benefits .
we would have to make our systems interoperable , share intelligence assessments , and link sensitive technologies . but such cooperation is a concrete way to build mutual trust and confidence .
for these reasons , the time has come to move forward on missile defense . we need a decision , by NATO ’ s next summit in November , that missile defense is an Alliance mission , and that we will explore every opportunity to cooperate with Russia .
but Russia also must decide to view missile defense as an opportunity , rather than a threat . if that happens , we can move forward to create a missile-defense system that not only defends the Euro-Atlantic community , but that also brings it together .
the end of the Cold War has given us an enormous opportunity to achieve our goal of a Europe whole , free , and at peace . we are not quite there , but we are getting there . &amp; nbsp ;

the Hydrogen Solution
but , in the United States , unlike in Europe and Asia , discussion of hydrogen energy and fuel cells as systemic , game-changing technologies is largely absent . that needs to change : these clean , renewable energy sources promise not only zero-emission baseload power , but also a zero-emission fuel for cars and trucks , the biggest polluters of them all .
by now , many have heard about plans by big carmakers – including Honda , Toyota , and Hyundai – to launch hydrogen fuel-cell cars commercially around 2015 . Daimler , Ford , and Nissan plan to launch such cars around 2017 .
but a bigger , largely unreported , message is that some European countries , especially Germany , have launched projects that combine renewables like solar and wind with hydrogen for energy storage , implying clean , zero-emission , stable power grids that require no coal , oil , or nuclear power .
the project ’ s partners are a Belgian grocery chain , the European Commission , and various European organizations and companies . Canada ’ s Hydrogenics is providing the electrolyzer and a fuel cell .
meanwhile , near Berlin , five companies launched a € 10 million ( $ 13 million ) pilot project at Berlin ’ s main airport in Schoenefeld in December , expanding and converting an existing hydrogen fueling station to CO2 neutrality by linking it to a nearby wind farm . earlier last year , two German utilities , Thüga and E.ON , announced two gas demonstration plants .
the previous year , German Chancellor Angela Merkel laid the plant ’ s cornerstone herself , sending a strong signal of her seriousness about Germany ’ s shift to clean , renewable energy . indeed , the much-noted Energiewende , or energy turnaround , that she announced in 2010 is arguably one of the most audacious acts of environmental statesmanship yet .
Germany ’ s move toward renewable energy is likely to have a much broader positive impact . a six-article series , “ The German Nuclear Exit , ” in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist argues that the move away from nuclear energy is already “ yielding measurable economic and environmental benefits . ”
more broadly , Lutz Mez , a political scientist at Berlin ’ s Free University , argues that the country ’ s shift has “ observably decoupled energy supply from economic growth , ” and that the “ evolving Energiewende , rather than the nuclear phase-out ” implies “ continuing reforms of social , economic , technological , and cultural policy in Germany . ”
what , one wonders , are lagging nations waiting for ?
the Promise of Iraq ’ s Constitution
the constitutional process now under way in Iraq represents a hopeful milestone for all Iraqis . after decades of successively imposed constitutions , an elected assembly has overseen the process of drafting a new permanent constitution , and the draft text will be voted on by ordinary Iraqis on October 15 .
much of the current talk about the draft ’ s various provisions thus misses the point . regardless of whether the referendum succeeds or fails , and regardless of the details of the constitutional text , what is most important is the establishment of constitutional processes and institutions in Iraq , before and after the referendum .
concerning the pre-referendum phase , the National Assembly largely succeeded in this task . although Iraq ’ s interim constitution gave the Assembly exclusive control over the drafting process , the Assembly wisely reached out beyond its membership in creating a constitutional drafting committee .
Iraqi leaders were well aware of the decreased participation in the election by a significant portion of Iraq ’ s multi-ethnic and multi-confessional mosaic , particularly the Sunni community . accordingly , they sought out those who were under-represented in the Assembly , but whose sense of participation in and ownership of the process was essential , not merely to the constitutional exercise , but to binding the nation ’ s wounds .
reaching out was an important component of establishing the rule of law , and it also sent a message that Iraq had truly turned a corner – that no single party sought to dominate Iraq . this was an important signal that those elected to the National Assembly understood that democracy does not mean merely the will of the majority .
in the end , Iraq ’ s voters will decide whether this is a constitution under which they wish to be governed for the foreseeable future . those who chose not to participate in last January ’ s elections will most certainly do so now , both in the referendum and in the upcoming elections to a new Assembly in December .
a second important feature of the drafting process was the extent to which the National Assembly complied with the requirements of Iraq ’ s interim constitution , the Transitional Administrative Law ( TAL ) . at the time of the transfer of authority in June of 2004 , many pundits predicted that an elected National Assembly would ignore an interim constitution drafted by an unelected Governing Council and promulgated by an occupying authority .
the TAL set a rigorous schedule for the Assembly to complete an initial constitutional draft , and the Assembly essentially abided by those limits . the deadline extension that it passed was in keeping with both the spirit and the letter of the TAL .
the test for institution building , however , will come once a constitution has been approved and a new government installed . regardless of who wins the elections , there will be temptations to tinker with the constitutional text .
however , given the little weight given to constitutions in Iraq ’ s modern history , it is likely that the political class will leave the text alone . barring some compelling need , the calculus might well arise that it is more important to abide by the constitution for some time – and to be seen to be abiding by it – than it is even to improve its provisions .
the American administration was absolutely right to resist the call to turn Iraq over to a caudillo , as some wanted . Iraq ’ s salvation from the nightmare that it endured over the previous 35 years lies not in any one man ; indeed , reliance on “ one man ” was the central ingredient in Saddamist rule .
here again , Iraq ’ s immediate past history allows one to be optimistic . the Iraqi Governing Council was not dominated by any single member , and Iraq ’ s subsequent governments have also operated collegially .
giving life to constitutionally defined political institutions is far more important to the course of Iraq ’ s immediate future than the specific provisions that the constitution contains . that has been the missing ingredient , not only in Iraq , but also in other countries ruled by despots .
constitutions frequently enshrine lofty principals , and nobly assure protection of fundamental rights . the question is whether those guarantees are given meaning on the ground .
the Prophet and the Commissars
Moscow – Prophets , it is said , are supposed to be without honor in their homeland . yet Moscow has just witnessed the extraordinary sight of Alexander Solzhenitsyn – the dissident and once-exiled author of the Gulag Archipelago and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich – receiving what amounts to a state funeral , with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin acting as chief mourner .
so , even in death , Alexander Solzhenitsyn will , it seems , remain a force to be reckoned with . but will he be a force in keeping with the liberating vistas of his greatest works ?
yet the Kremlin understands that something is needed to replace them as Russia adapts to its new oil-fueled autocracy . Solzhenitsyn , one of the most famous and heroic dissidents of the Soviet era , now seems certain to become a towering figure in the iconography of Putinism .
to achieve this goal he sought to restore high culture to a position of primacy in Russian life , and to put mass media in its ( politically ) subservient place . Putin held up Solzhenitsyn as a model for those who stand for the ideal of Great Russia – “ an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving of the people , fatherland , and the ideals of freedom , justice , and humanism . ”
in choosing to allow One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich to be published , Khrushchev knew that he was undermining the entire Soviet era up to that point . but , with Khrushchev ’ s overthrow in 1964 , Leonid Brezhnev lost no time in restoring orthodoxy and purging books that threatened the Party ’ s reputation .
yet Khrushchev , isolated and in disgrace , continued to see a bond between himself and the great author . as Solzhenitsyn wrote in his memoir The Oak and the Calf : “ as late as 1966 , he &#91; Khrushchev &#93; sent me New Year ’ s greetings — which astonished me because I was on the brink of arrest .
one lesson of the 1989 revolution in Eastern Europe is the value of having truly democratic-minded figures lead the escape from communism . Poland had Lech Walesa ;
Russia , sadly , had no one with the moral authority to soothe people ’ s passions . only Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov came near to Walesa and Havel in terms of moral authority , but Sakharov was dead by the time communism collapsed , and Solzhenitsyn ’ s ideas were too conservative , too tied to Russian nationalism , for him to become a symbol of democracy in a multi-national Soviet Union .
the tragedy of Solzhenitsyn is that , although he played a mighty role in liberating Russia from totalitarianism , he had nothing to say to ordinary Russians after their liberation , except to chastise them . yet perhaps one day we Russians will escape our false dreams , and when that day comes , the heroic Solzhenitsyn , the Solzhenitsyn who could never surrender or be corrupted , will be restored to us .
what Use Are Economists ?
Cambridge – When the stakes are high , it is no surprise that battling political opponents use whatever support they can garner from economists and other researchers . that is what happened when conservative American politicians and European Union officials latched on to the work of two Harvard professors – Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff – to justify their support of fiscal austerity .
Reinhart and Rogoff published a paper that appeared to show that public-debt levels above 90 % of GDP significantly impede economic growth . three economists from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst then did what academics are routinely supposed to do – replicate their colleagues ’ work and subject it to criticism .
along with a relatively minor spreadsheet error , they identified some methodological choices in the original Reinhart / Rogoff work that threw the robustness of their results into question . most important , even though debt levels and growth remained negatively correlated , the evidence for a 90 % threshold was revealed to be quite weak .
Reinhart and Rogoff have strongly contested accusations by many commentators that they were willing , if not willful , participants in a game of political deception . they have defended their empirical methods and insist that they are not the deficit hawks that their critics portray them to be .
the dueling analyses clarified the nature of the data , their limitations , and the difference that alternative methods of processing them made to the results . ultimately , Reinhart and Rogoff were not that far apart from their critics on either what the evidence showed or what the policy implications were .
so the silver lining in this fracas is that it showed that economics can progress by the rules of science . no matter how far apart their political views may have been , the two sides shared a common language about what constitutes evidence and – for the most part – a common approach to resolving differences .
because the 90 % threshold had become political fodder , its subsequent demolition also gained broader political meaning . despite their protests , Reinhart and Rogoff were accused of providing scholarly cover for a set of policies for which there was , in fact , limited supporting evidence .
a solution that will not work is for economists to second-guess how their ideas will be used or misused in public debate and to shade their public statements accordingly . for example , Reinhart and Rogoff might have downplayed their results – such as they were – in order to prevent them from being misused by deficit hawks .
moreover , when economists adjust their message to fit their audience , the result is the opposite of what is intended : they rapidly lose credibility .
for fear of empowering the “ protectionist barbarians , ” trade economists are prone to exaggerate the benefits of trade and downplay its distributional and other costs . in practice , this often leads to their arguments being captured by interest groups on the other side – global corporations that seek to manipulate trade rules to their own advantage .
but economists should match honesty about what their research says with honesty about the inherently provisional nature of what passes as evidence in their profession . economics , unlike the natural sciences , rarely yields cut-and-dried results .
second , empirical evidence is rarely reliable enough to settle decisively a controversy characterized by deeply divided opinion . this is particularly true in macroeconomics , of course , where data are few and open to diverse interpretations .
but even in microeconomics , where it is sometimes possible to generate precise empirical estimates using randomization techniques , the results must be extrapolated in order to be applied in other settings . new economic evidence serves at best to nudge the views – a little here , a little there – of those inclined to be open-minded .
the implications go beyond not over-selling any particular research result . journalists , politicians , and the general public have a tendency to attribute greater authority and precision to what economists say than economists should really feel comfortable with .
there is one other thing that the public should know about economists : it is cleverness , not wisdom , that advances academic economists ’ careers . professors at the top universities distinguish themselves today not by being right about the real world , but by devising imaginative theoretical twists or developing novel evidence .
the Public and Its Problems
Chicago – On a recent visit to Europe , I found economists , journalists , and business people thoroughly frustrated with their politicians . why , they ask , can ’ t politicians see the abyss that yawns before them , and come together to resolve the euro crisis once and for all ?
even if there is no consensus on what a solution might be , can ’ t they meet and thrash out a plan that goes beyond their repeated half-measures ? it is only because of the European Central Bank ’ s bold decision to lend long term to banks that we have seen some respite recently , or so their argument goes .
one answer that can be easily dismissed is that politicians simply don ’ t understand the gravity of the situation . political leaders need not be economic geniuses to understand the advice that they hear , and many are both intelligent and well-read .
a second answer – that politicians have short time horizons , owing to electoral cycles – may contain a kernel of truth , but it is inadequate , because the adverse consequences of timid action often become apparent well before they are up for re-election .
the best answer that I have heard comes from Axel Weber , the former president of Germany ’ s Bundesbank and an astute political observer . in Weber ’ s view , policymakers simply do not have the public mandate to get ahead of problems , especially novel ones that seem small initially , but , if unresolved , imply potentially large costs .
and , if action prevents the problem , the public never experiences the averted calamity , and voters therefore penalize political leaders for the immediate costs that the action entails . even if politicians have perfect foresight of the disaster that awaits if nothing is done , they may have little ability to persuade voters , or less insightful party members , that the short-term costs must be paid .
talk is cheap , and , in the absence of evidence to the contrary , the status quo usually appears comfortable enough . so leaders ’ ability to take corrective action increases only with time , as some of the costs of inaction are experienced .
calamity can still be averted if the costs of inaction escalate steadily . the worst problems , however , are those with “ inaction costs ” that remain invisible for a long time , but increase suddenly and explosively .
Hitler ’ s plans were outlined in Mein Kampf for all to read – and he did not disguise them in his speeches . yet few in Britain wanted to give them credence , and many thought that communism was the greater threat , especially in the bleak years of the Great Depression .
the Nazis ’ dismembering of Czechoslovakia in 1938 made the sincerity of Hitler ’ s ambitions all too clear . but it was only after the invasion of Poland the following year that Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty , and he became Prime Minister only after the invasion of France in 1940 , when Britain stood alone .
Britain might well have been better off had Churchill held power earlier , but that would have meant costly rearmament , which was unacceptable so long as there was a chance that Hitler proved to be a paper tiger . and , of course , it would also have meant entrusting Britain ’ s fate to a politician who , though now regarded as an indomitable leader , was widely distrusted at the time .
non-linear costs of inaction are most obvious in the financial sector . at the same time , financial-sector problems may be particularly difficult to address : if politicians emphasize the need for action too strongly in order to get a mandate , they might precipitate the very turmoil that they seek to contain .
it took the post-Lehman panic for Congress to authorize the Troubled Asset Relief Program , which threw a financial lifeline to banks and the auto industry , among others . and only frenetic action by the Federal Reserve and Treasury ( with authorities around the world joining ) prevented a systemic meltdown .
similarly , eurozone politicians have obtained a mandate to take bolder action only as the markets have made the costs of inaction more salient . even setting aside Germany ’ s understandable attempt to limit how much it would have to pay , it is difficult to see how politicians could have gotten ahead of the problem .
have Europeans seen enough of the abyss to tolerate stronger action by their leaders ? if not , markets might have to deteriorate further to make possible a comprehensive resolution to the eurozone crisis .
similarly , with government bond yields as low as they are in the US , the public has little sense of urgency about its fiscal problems , though some doomsayers , like Peter Peterson of the Blackstone Group , have been trying their best to awaken it . one hopes that the coming US presidential election will lead to a more enlightened public debate about tax and entitlement reform .
don ’ t blame the leaders for appearing short-sighted and indecisive ; the fault may lie with us , the public , for not listening to the worrywarts .
whose Economic Reform ?
Paris – Together with fiscal consolidation , structural reform is the new European mantra . international organizations and European Union bodies regard such reform as a prerequisite of economic recovery , growth , and alleviation of the unemployment plague .
indeed , the agreement reached between the Greek government and the “ troika ” ( the International Monetary Fund , the European Central Bank , and the European Commission ) includes a 48-page list of detailed reforms . not all countries are given such a long to-do list , but , since new EU legislation was adopted in 2010 , specific recommendations are addressed to all .
poor productivity growth and stubborn unemployment are evidence that their economies require comprehensive transformation . but if this observation provides the rationale for reform , it does not provide a firm enough basis for drawing up effective economic-revival plans .
some are based on arm ’ s-length transactions , and others rely on recurring relationships . scholars refer to “ varieties of capitalism ” to highlight the absence of a single template for success .
international organizations generally point out – rightly – that in most cases a country can improve economic efficiency without changing its economic model . for example , there is often ample room for achieving the same income redistribution at lower budgetary cost , or for ensuring that collective wage agreements take into account the interests of those without a job .
countries are not only inefficient ; often , they are also inconsistent . for example , they pretend to become global hubs but do not welcome foreigners , which is what prevented Japan ’ s emergence as a world financial center in the 1990 ’ s ; or they hope to develop as knowledge-based economies but dislike academic freedom ; or they aim to nurture innovation but do not want innovators to become rich .
such inconsistency is often a major impediment to development . by contrast , the success of the United States as an innovation powerhouse relies on a high degree of consistency across fields ranging from education and immigration to taxation and the labor market .
so pro-growth reform not only requires substituting efficient arrangements for inefficient ones ; it also demands confronting hard choices , which is , at bottom , a political endeavor . for this reason , it is not something that any international organization can even suggest in lieu of a country ’ s voters .
as the economist Dani Rodrik has pointed out , standard analysis generally results in a laundry list of desirable reforms that does not tell governments where to begin . apprehensive leaders start with the most politically expedient items , while bold leaders start with the most challenging prescriptions ; but there is no guarantee that either of these approaches will deliver the expected result .
one reason is that the effectiveness of reform may depend on conditions prevailing in other sectors : good universities , for example , cannot remedy the consequences of poor secondary education . moreover , eliminating one distortion may be ineffective or even counterproductive : in an economy plagued with rents , partial reform may simply result in shifting them across sectors and agents , rather than reducing them to the benefit of consumers .
as a result , considerable political energy may be consumed in pushing through measures that deliver very little . instead , reform should start with the most binding constraint to performance ( which one that is depends on the whole set of hindrances that confront the economy ) .
but , while some reforms – for example , those improving access to credit or eliminating rents that harm consumers – can indeed help to boost growth during a demand shortfall like the one that Europe is now experiencing , others can have the opposite effect . for example , labor-market reforms that make it easier for companies to reduce staff may weaken demand further , underscoring the importance of considering reforms ’ short-term effects .
on the contrary , these bodies can be very valuable insofar as they carry out international comparisons and point out deficiencies . but there is a line in the sand beyond which only governments can set priorities and act .
the Quality of Mercy
around the same time , the Philadelphia Eagles , an American football team , offered a second chance to former star Michael Vick , who was convicted of running a dog-fighting operation in which unsuccessful fighters were tortured and killed . and William Calley , who commanded the platoon that massacred hundreds of Vietnamese civilians at the village of My Lai in 1968 , has now broken his media silence and apologized for his actions .
many societies treat crimes involving cruelty to animals far too lightly , but Vick ’ s penalty – 23 months in prison – was substantial . in addition to imprisonment , he missed two years of his playing career , and millions of dollars in earnings .
perhaps more importantly , he has turned words into deeds , volunteering at an animal shelter and working with the Humane Society of the United States to oppose dog fighting . it is hard to see what good would come from not allowing him to complete his rehabilitation and return to doing what he does best .
he had served only seven years when Kenny MacAskill , the Scottish Justice Minister , released him on compassionate grounds , based on a medical report that Megrahi has terminal cancer , and only three months to live . the question of remorse has not arisen , because Megrahi has never admitted guilt , and did not drop an appeal against his conviction until just before his release .
there has also been speculation that Megrahi ’ s release was related to negotiations over oil contracts between Britain and Libya . finally , some question whether Megrahi really was the perpetrator of the crime , and this may have played a role in MacAskill ’ s decision ( although , if so , that would have been better left to the courts to resolve ) .
but let us leave such questions aside for the moment . assuming that Megrahi was guilty , and that he was released because he has only a short time to live , does a prisoner ’ s terminal illness justify compassionate release ?
the answer might depend on the nature of the crime , the length of the sentence , and the proportion of it that remains to be served . for a pickpocket who has served half of a two-year sentence , it would be excessively harsh to insist on the sentence being served in full if that meant that he would die in prison , rather than with his family .
MacAskill , in a statement to the Scottish Parliament defending his decision , refrained from quoting from the best-known speech on mercy in the English language – that of Portia in Shakespeare ’ s The Merchant of Venice – but Portia ’ s words would have fitted the core of his statement . Portia acknowledges that Shylock is under no obligation to show mercy to Antonio , who is in breach of his agreement to him .
MacAskill acknowledged that Megrahi himself showed no compassion , but rightly points out that this alone is not a reason to deny him compassion in his final days . he then appeals to the values of humanity , compassion , and mercy as “ the beliefs we seek to live by ” and frames his decision as being true to Scottish values .
we can reasonably disagree with MacAskill ’ s decision , but we should acknowledge that – unless there is more going on than appears on the surface – he was motivated by some of the finest values we are capable of exercising . and , if we believe that Megrahi was not sufficiently punished for his crime , what are we to make of the treatment of former Lieutenant William Calley ?
he was also convicted of assault with intent to murder a Vietnamese child . yet three days – yes , days – after his conviction , President Richard Nixon ordered that he be released from prison and allowed to serve his sentence in a comfortable two-bedroom house .
Calley always claimed that he was following orders . captain Ernest Medina , his commanding officer , ordered him to burn the village down and pollute its wells , but there is no clear evidence that the order included killing non-combatants – and of course if such an order were issued , it should not have been obeyed .
after decades of refusing to speak publicly , Calley , who is now 66 , recently said that “ not a day goes by ” when he does not feel remorse “ for what happened that day in My Lai . ” One wonders if the relatives of those murdered at My Lai are more ready to forgive Calley than the relatives of those killed at Lockerbie are to forgive Megrahi .
the Quest for Investment
the Hong Kong meeting of the Doha Round of trade negotiations has left a palpable sense of frustration in the developing world over the slow pace of agricultural liberalization agreed to by the rich countries . it may thus appear naive and counterproductive to raise the bar and suggest that we need to go beyond trade and move investment to the top of our priority list .
it had originally been intended that the Doha Round would address investment , but the developing countries chose to downgrade the issue and concentrate on agriculture instead . this tactic has proven to be a two-edged sword .
in China , Brazil , Malaysia , and Mexico , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) accounts for 8 % to 12 % of gross fixed capital formation – without generating debt . although the least developed countries attract less than 3 % of north-south investments , these flows account for more than 3 % of their GDP , a level higher than the average for developing countries .
competition among countries to attract investors is intense , and only a few , such as China or India , are able to negotiate on equal terms with the industrialized world . the developing countries , therefore , have an interest in calling for multilateral dialogue on investment conditions in order to obtain certain collective guarantees .
in the nineteenth century , the United States restricted foreign investment in several sectors , including finance . today , both the US and the European Union keep a close watch on international acquisitions .
refusal to recognize the legitimacy of such strategies caused the collapse of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment in 1998 , after three years of negotiations between the OECD countries . the project was perceived – rightly so – as amounting to a surrender of sovereignty , because it introduced a rigid principle of non-discrimination between foreign and local companies that would eliminate the host country ’ s room for maneuver without offering anything in return .
it would also need to help poor countries cope with the quasi-generalization of “ social and environmental responsibility ” standards that are increasingly shaping corporate practices and consumer demand . it should incorporate an investor code of ethics , as well as a formula for sharing the costs of implementing such standards among the state , foreign operators , and local sub-contractors .
of course , imposing the same investment conditions in all countries could take away the incentive to invest in the least attractive of them . but an agreement could be reached to establish categories of countries , the most important aim being to prevent dumping between countries that are at the same stage of development .
to succeed , a multilateral negotiation would also need to address the expectations of foreign operators , who want assurances that their investments are safe . an agreement should contain provisions to improve the business environment – its transparency and predictability – by setting a framework for state intervention without stripping government of its prerogatives .
no multilateral investment agreement will be able to address all of the institutional problems and market failures that prevent capital from flowing to developing countries . some economists point to imperfect information , which precludes companies from considering the higher returns on investment available in the developing world .
other analysts point to the increasing returns that accompany greater concentration of investment – a force that works to the disadvantage of poor countries . at the very least , a multilateral negotiation would provide an occasion to recognize the existence of the problem , reflect on how best to coordinate investments , and help move development assistance accordingly .
despite the complexity involved and the need for technical assistance to the weakest nations in the negotiation , a multilateral investment agreement should be among the top priorities on the international agenda . indeed , whereas agricultural trade issues put rich and poor countries ’ national interests on a collision course , promoting investment flows to the developing world could unify all countries around a shared objective .
the Questions of Europe
their vote was a protest against globalization , a rejection of the contemporary world , with its distant and incomprehensible governing mechanisms . like the anti-globalization movement , the new anti-Europeanism can be regarded as a demand for a different European model – an “ alter-Europeanism . ”
the issue , therefore , is not what Tony Blair , in his inaugural speech to the European Parliament , called a crisis of leadership . no statesman has emerged because the crisis runs deeper .
this phase culminated with the collapse of communism in 1989 , but the chance to overcome the Continent ’ s historical divisions now required a redefinition of the European project . the treaties of Maastricht ( 1992 ) and Amsterdam ( 1997 ) created a new organizational structure for the EU and laid the foundations for political institutions equal to Europe ’ s economic power .
the EU will continue to be governed under the Nice Treaty of 2000 , but this leaves no room for further political integration ( or enlargement ) , nor does it ensure the effective functioning of the Union ’ s institutions . drafting a new constitutional treaty would probably require even more time than was needed for the current proposal , and it is also unlikely that the necessary changes could be introduced through an intergovernmental conference .
this would require prolonging the ratification deadline until 2008 . it also requires specifying a common date for ratification ( through simultaneous referenda or parliamentary votes ) for all countries that have not yet done so , including France and the Netherlands .
in other words , the current “ pause for reflection ” is not the time to change the draft ’ s text ( although the intergovernmental conference could move the third part , which harmonizes the earlier treaties , to an annex ) . rather , the task is to alter the political and socio-psychological context of the ratification process by addressing key questions .
first , how should relations between national and common European interests be defined ? at issue is not only the allocation of competencies , but also the more fundamental matter of when to rely on intergovernmental institutions and when to turn to the European people as a whole .
the European Council , which represents member states in the structures of the Union , could be given a more public character . it could then be seen , in a bicameral system , as a kind of “ Chamber of Nations ” within the framework of what Jacques Delors called a “ federation of nation states . ”
Europe is a peculiar combination of geography and history , but the boundaries of the EU – and thus the prospects for its further enlargement – are determined by its absorptive capacity and the adaptive abilities of candidate countries . is enlargement the only effective policy of stabilization and peace ?
third , instead of futile opposition between “ liberal ” and “ social ” models of economic development , we need a confrontation of the experiences of Great Britain and Sweden , on the one hand , and Germany and France , on the other . are these experiences mutually exclusive , or is convergence possible ?
the threats facing the world today are supranational , so counteracting them must be supranational , too . but this is impossible without a clear European identity – and thus a common interest to be asserted and defended .
in the aftermath of the French and Dutch referenda , the European Commission and the European Parliament have sketched plans for a Europe-wide debate on these issues . but such a debate also demands an organizational framework to engage European civil society , national parliaments , and pan-European mass media .
only a new European debate that embodies the common action of European citizens and institutions can combat “ alter-Europeanism ” effectively . the time may not have come for a true European constitution , but confronting , rather than evading , the fundamental issues that the EU faces could create the proper context for reviving the constitutional treaty and preparing the Union for the challenges of our time .
whose Central Bank ?
Berkeley – Broadly speaking , for at least 115 years ( and possibly longer ) – that is , at least since the publication of the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell ’ s Geldzins und Güterpreis ( Interest and Prices ) in 1898 – economists have split into two camps with respect to what a central bank is and the purposes it should serve .
its clients are the banks ; it is a place where banks can go to borrow money when they really need to ; and its functions are to support the banking sector so that banks can make their proper profits as they go about their proper business . above all , the central bank must ensure that the money supply is large enough that mere illiquidity , rather than insolvency , does not force banks into bankruptcy and liquidation .
for both , reducing the imbalance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand required , first and foremost , preserving the banking system ; and preserving the banking system required boosting aggregate demand to bring it closer to aggregate supply . there was a lot of bank rescue in economic stimulus ; and there was a lot of economic stimulus in rescuing banks .
thereafter , the two camps ’ interests and conclusions diverged sharply . a prolonged and sustained central-bank policy of keeping short-term Treasury nominal interest rates low is essential to keeping the many interest rate-sensitive components of aggregate demand from falling even further below potential aggregate supply .
a prolonged and sustained central bank policy of purchasing ever-increasing quantities of long-term assets is essential to encourage a wary financial sector to use some of its risk-bearing capacity for its proper purpose : reducing the risk burden on entrepreneurship and enterprise . but such a policy diminishes , and may even eliminate , financiers ’ ability to take the easy route by riding the duration yield curve for profits .
in terms of the US public interest – and that of the world – it is very important that whoever President Barack Obama nominates to succeed Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke when his term expires at the beginning of 2014 is from the Macroeconomic Camp . the world does not need a bankers ’ central banker any more today than it did five years ago .
the Real Danger of Global Warming
I was invited to address this issue at a recent conference in Santa Barbara , California . my audience included business leaders who hope to profit from cap-and-trade policies and from subsidies for renewable energy and “ green ” jobs .
Europe is several years ahead of the US in implementing policies intended to mitigate global warming . all of the European Union ’ s member countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol and adopted a wide range of policies to lower their emissions and meet their Kyoto targets .
these policies include a cap-and-trade initiative known as the Emissions Trading Scheme , steep fuel taxes , and ambitious programs to build windmills and other renewable energy projects . these policies were undertaken at a time when the EU economy was doing well and – one hopes – with full knowledge that they would have significant costs .
second , energy rationing policies like cap-and-trade will be a permanent drag on economic activity . ironically , emissions have not decreased as a result of these policies , but are doing so now as the world economy moves into recession .
this is not a surprise to someone like me , having been actively involved in my country ’ s transition from communism to a free society and market economy . the old , outmoded heavy industries that were the pride of our Communist regime were shut down – practically overnight – because they could not survive the opening of the economy .
as the economies of the Czech Republic and other central and eastern European countries were rebuilt and began to grow again , emissions have naturally started to increase . it should be clear to everyone that there is a very strong correlation between economic growth and energy use .
so I am amazed to see people going along with the currently fashionable political argument that policies like cap-and-trade , government mandates , and subsidies for renewable energy can actually benefit an economy . it is claimed that government , working together with business , will create “ a new energy economy , ” that the businesses involved will profit , and that everyone will be better off .
consumers who are forced to pay higher prices for energy will have less money to spend on other things . while the individual companies that provide the higher-priced “ green ” energy may do well , the net economic effect will be negative .
profits can be made when energy is rationed or subsidized , but only within an economy operating at lower , or even negative , growth rates . this means that over the longer term , everyone will be competing for a piece of a pie that is smaller than it would have been without energy rationing .
this does not auger well either for growth or for working our way out of today ’ s crisis .
the Reality of Virtual Power
Davos – As Arab regimes struggle with demonstrations fueled by Twitter and Al Jazeera , and American diplomats try to understand the impact of WikiLeaks , it is clear that this global information age will require a more sophisticated understanding of how power works in world politics .
the transition of power from one dominant state to another is a familiar historical pattern , but power diffusion is a more novel process . the problem for all states today is that more is happening outside the control of even the most powerful of them .
as for power transition , much attention nowadays is lavished on a supposed American decline , often with facile historical analogies to Britain and Rome . but Rome remained dominant for more than three centuries after the apogee of its power , and , even then , it did not succumb to the rise of another state , but suffered a death by a thousand cuts inflicted by various barbarian tribes .
indeed , for all the fashionable predictions that China , India , or Brazil will surpass the United States in the coming decades , the greatest threats may come from modern barbarians and non-state actors . in an information-based world of cyber-insecurity , power diffusion may be a greater threat than power transition .
what will it mean to wield power in the global information age of the twenty-first century ? which resources will produce power ?
every age produces its own answers . in the sixteenth century , control of colonies and gold bullion gave Spain the edge ; seventeenth-century Holland profited from trade and finance ; eighteenth-century France gained from its larger population and armies ; and nineteenth-century British power rested on industrial and naval primacy .
in an information age , however , it may be the state ( or non-state ) with the best story that wins . today , it is far from clear how to measure a balance of power , much less how to develop successful survival strategies for this new world .
most current projections of a shift in the global balance of power are based primarily on one factor : projections of countries ’ GDP growth . they thus ignore the other dimensions of power , including both hard military power and the soft power of narrative , not to mention the policy difficulties of combining them into successful strategies .
States will remain the dominant actor on the world stage , but they will find the stage far more crowded and difficult to control . a much larger part of their populations than ever before has access to the power that comes from information .
governments have always worried about the flow and control of information , and the current period is not the first to be strongly affected by dramatic changes in information technology . what is new – and what we see manifested in the Middle East today – is the speed of communication and the technological empowerment of a wider range of actors .
the current information age , sometimes called the “ Third Industrial Revolution , ” is based on rapid technological advances in computers , communications , and software , which in turn have led to a dramatic fall in the cost of creating , processing , transmitting , and searching for information of all kinds . and this means that world politics can no longer be the sole province of governments .
as the cost of computing and communication comes down , the barriers to entry decline . individuals and private organizations , ranging from corporations to NGOs to terrorists , have thus been empowered to play a direct role in world politics .
the speed of Internet time means that all governments will have less control over their agendas . political leaders will enjoy fewer degrees of freedom before they must respond to events , and then will have to compete with an increasing number and variety of actors in order to be heard .
we see this as American policymakers struggle to cope with today ’ s Middle East disturbances . the fall of the Tunisian regime had deep domestic roots , but the timing caught outsiders , including the US government , by surprise .
in Egypt , Hosni Mubarak ’ s rule helped to moderate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and balanced Iranian power in the region . simplistic endorsement of democracy by George W. Bush ’ s administration was costly both in Iraq and in Gaza , where elections gave rise to a hostile Hamas-led government .
in an information age , smart policy combines hard and soft power . given what the US is , the Obama administration cannot afford to neglect the soft-power narrative of democracy , liberty , and openness .
thus , Obama and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have issued public as well as private appeals for reform and change in Egypt and the wider Arab world , while also urging limits to violence by all parties . moreover , they have aligned themselves with freedom of information in the face of efforts by the Egyptian regime to block Internet access .
how events in the Middle East will play out is anyone ’ s guess , but in today ’ s information age , upholding the freedom to access it will be an important component of smart power .
Open-Access Economics
Canberra – The brouhaha over Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff ’ s article “ Growth in a Time of Debt ” may be the most conspicuous and incendiary scholarly controversy since 1974 , when two earlier economists , Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman , published a notorious book , Time on the Cross , defending the efficiency of American plantation slavery .
as with Time on the Cross , the Reinhart / Rogoff controversy , while ostensibly stemming from the authors ’ statistical procedures , is actually rooted in the purposes to which others put their study .
some of the results reported by Fogel and Engerman were used – not by the authors themselves , it should be noted – to challenge affirmative action and question the civil-rights movement . similarly , some of the results reported by Reinhart and Rogoff have been used by politicians and others to justify fiscal austerity .
when the problems with the Reinhart / Rogoff analysis came to light , the critics were aghast . the authors had inadvertently omitted data , used a questionable weighting scheme , and employed an erroneous observation on GDP growth .
this raised uncomfortable questions not only about the efficacy of austerity , but also about the reliability of economic analysis . how could a flawed study have appeared first in the prestigious working-paper series of the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) and then in a journal of the American Economic Association ?
it was possible because economists are not obliged to make their data and programs publicly available when publishing scientific research . it is said that NBER working papers are even more prestigious than publication in refereed journals .
and , as empirical economics has progressed , the difficulty of doing so has grown . Reinhart and Rogoff may have used a relatively small set of mostly publicly available data , but the profession as a whole is using ever-larger tailor-made data sets .
and the incentive for authors to cooperate is , at best , mixed . it is therefore the responsibility of editorial boards and the directors of organizations like the NBER to make open access obligatory .
moreover , in a discipline that regards ingenuity as the ultimate virtue , those who engage in the grunt work of data cleaning and replication receive few rewards . Nobel prizes are not awarded for constructing new historical estimates of GDP that allow policy analysis to be extended back in time .
then there is the fact that correlation is not causation . in the case of Reinhart and Rogoff , the observation that highly indebted countries grow more slowly , even if true , does not tell us anything about whether high debt causes slow growth or vice versa .
what is needed is not more sophisticated statistical methods , but serious historical analysis of the political and economic particulars of specific historical cases in which countries were burdened with heavy debts . a proper historical analysis would help to identify cases in which debt was incurred for reasons other than the state of the economy , so that causality arguably runs from debt to growth , rather than the other way around .
my Berkeley colleagues David and Christina Romer , for example , faced an analogous problem when seeking to determine whether monetary-policy shocks affect economic growth . they used careful historical analysis to identify and focus on cases in which the policy stance changed for reasons not having to do with the current state of the economy .
statistics are helpful . but in economics , as in other lines of social inquiry , they are no substitute for proper historical analysis .
the real problem is scholarly procedures and priorities , not motives . if the problem of procedures and priorities is addressed , the fact that politicians are tempted to misuse scholarly analysis for their own ends will take care of itself .
in other words , what is true of the economy is equally true of economic analysis . a crisis is a terrible thing to waste .
the Real Route to Democracy at the IMF
emerging market countries from Chile to China have been arguing for some time that the International Monetary Fund – the nerve center of the international financial system ­ – needs to become more “ democratic . ” They want more policy influence the next time the Fund decides to bail out a fellow emerging-market country like Argentina , Brazil , Indonesia , and Turkey .
the IMF ’ s perceived “ democratic deficit ” is a serious challenge to the Fund ’ s political legitimacy and to its ability to effectively stabilize crisis situations . but let ’ s recognize that real democracy is only going to come when middle-income developing countries are prepared to back up their lofty rhetoric with hard cash .
right now is precisely the time to do so , given that the United States has become , without rival , the world ’ s most reckless borrower . the US is draining a whopping 75 % of the world ’ s surplus savings .
these countries need to understand that calls to cut rich-country voting shares at the IMF , unless they are backed up by real money , are naïve , if not downright hypocritical . at the end of the day , as long as the IMF is in the lending business , it needs to keep its creditors happy .
many middle-income countries ’ central banks are hoarding dollars today in order to prevent their currencies from appreciating too much against the sinking dollar . China alone , with over $ 600 billion in reserves , holds more than enough dollars to recapitalize the IMF four times over .
it may seem strange to make middle-income countries pay for their own bailout insurance , but it isn ’ t . they have much more at stake in IMF policies than do rich countries .
admittedly , no developing country ever seems to vote against a big bailout for one of its brethren , no matter how ill conceived . but would such indiscriminate largesse persist if middle-income countries knew that their votes really counted , and that they were spending their own money ?
after all , the laws of economics are always going to force prodigal debtor countries into adopting austerity measures . if a country that has been borrowing like a drunk suddenly sees its credit dry up , it will tighten its belt – raise taxes , cut spending , or do both – with or without an international lender of last resort .
in any case , greater political legitimacy would likely make the Fund ’ s crisis leadership smoother and more credible , potentially shortening crises and minimizing their pain .
the big question is whether the rich countries that have long ruled the roost at the Fund would actually surrender some of their power . they might , and they should , even if global financial markets take time to adjust to a slightly smaller role for the dollar .
so there is an upside to today ’ s massive US fiscal and current account deficits . the structure of global imbalances , with the US the big borrower and emerging markets the creditors , presents a rare opportunity to finance a change in governance at the IMF .
fulfilling the Genomic Promise
Vienna – For most people , a promise is a reason to expect something , a well-founded hope without hype . and it is a promise in this sense that connects science to society : the public trusts that scientific and technological advancement are the keys to navigating the uncertain road to a better world , in which future generations can live longer , healthier , and happier lives .
after discovering that mathematics could be applied to understanding the physical world , a small group of natural philosophers turned toward experimental empiricism with practical objectives . spearheaded by this minority , the scientific revolution swept through Europe and , later , spread to the rest of the world .
by imitating and twisting nature , he declared , its secrets would be revealed – and could be manipulated to improve humans ’ lives . Bacon ’ s pragmatic objective of using a scientific understanding of natural causes to “ effect all things possible ” – what is now called innovation – was science ’ s original promise to society , and formed the core of the Age of Enlightenment .
and yet society ’ s trust in science has not wavered . while specific objectives have changed , the overarching belief that scientific knowledge transforms people ’ s lives – as cultural , educational , and institutional factors converge with technological and industrial dynamics – has remained strong .
since James D. Watson and Francis Crick uncovered DNA ’ s structure in 1953 , a massive amount of available genetic data has been identified , and novel forms of scientific organization and modes of working have emerged . as a result , genetics has brought science to the brink of a new era of enlightenment , in which individuals are understood in terms of the relationships among their unique genomic data .
this movement – the latest incarnation of the endless quest for human advancement – poses new challenges to the relationship between science and society . as the American Museum of Natural History provocatively asked at the 2001 opening of its genetics exhibition : “ The genomic revolution is here – are you ready ? ”
the growing understanding of transgenerational epigenetic modifications , whether nutritional or neurological , has opened new perspectives on the plasticity of the phenotype ( an organism ’ s observable characteristics ) , and the factors that might affect it . as a result , it is now clear that people ’ s lifestyles do not concern only themselves .
these developments – and the questions that they raise – underscore the need to redraw the map of the sciences . a more integrated research agenda that includes the social sciences is crucial to ensuring that the promise of genetic research benefits all .
in fact , such research is integral to improving upon the factors that contribute most to a society ’ s wealth : health , education , and ethics . indeed , more encompassing knowledge of personal genomics can engender a new sense of commonality .
to this end , the collaboration of social and scientific institutions would help to break down language and cultural barriers , ensuring that the genomic revolution aids , rather than alienates , the public , and thereby passes the true test of any scientific advancement : relevance to everyday experience . in a world characterized by multiple , overlapping crises , people need to see , understand , and identify with what genetics has to offer .
when asked what should keep us awake at night , the economist Amartya Sen answered , “ The tragedies that we can prevent , the injustice that we can repair . ” Applying scientific advances to the prevention of tragedy and the redress of injustice fulfills science ’ s core promise .
the Re-Birth of Utopia
behind the critiques directed at the EU and national governments as “ not being social enough , ” lurks an image of the Union as a trap that is forcing its members to bend to the fateful disciplines of the market , thus depriving national leaders of their ability to realize important social goals . this cleavage now seems set to shape not only Germany ’ s future coalition government , but the future of politics across Europe .
in France , this division is evident not only on the extremes of right and left , and in traditionally nationalist Gaullist circles , but also among most socialist voters , who decided to spurn the party leadership ’ s pro-European stance .
this fundamental debate is not about to abate . on the contrary , as the German election shows and with a presidential election looming in France , the debate has intensified .
with preparations for the party ’ s November congress in full swing , a conflict that goes back to the party ’ s founding is reappearing . on one side is a social-democratic vision , which basically favors the market economy but seeks to alleviateits harsher effects ; on the other side stands a radical vision that extols a revolutionary “ break with capitalism . ”
with the disappearance of the communist world and the failure of its collectivist policies , one would think that this debate had been resolved in favor of the reformist vision . but the surprise of the last few months is that an important part of the Socialist electorate and party leaders back radical change .
moreover , a substantial portion of the broader anti-liberal left , composed of communists , ecologists , union activists , and adherents of the movement Attac accuse the reformists of subordinating themselves to liberal globalization and advocate , instead , a radical transformation of society and the economy .
the media success of Olivier Besancenot , a 31-year-old representative of the most intransigent section of the Trotskyist Revolutionary Communist League , reflects the power of this dream . having received over 4 % of the vote during the first round of the presidential election of 2002 , Besancenotis now , according to opinion polls , the 38th most popular person in France .
President Jacques Chirac of France , but also Brazil ’ s leftist president , Lula da Silva support a tax on airline tickets designed to finance poor countries ’ development . similarly , the centrist leader François Bayrou , has proposed imposing a “ Tobin tax ” ( named after its creator , the Nobel laureate economist James Tobin ) on financial transactions , with the proceeds to be used to support socially worthy causes .
how do we explain this resurgent radicalism , which seems to ignore European and international political realities ?
the welfare state , largely associated with the reformist social-democratic movement , is now reaching its limits in the form of uncontrolled public deficits and unsupportable levels of taxation . similarly , the social mobility once fostered by the welfare state has suffered serious reverses .
in this disenchanted environment , dreams of utopia thrive . but it is a fundamental characteristic of utopias that they cannot be implemented .
what is now needed is a more modest debate about how to reconcile the deficiencies of the market with the demands of solidarity . should the state confine itself to creating an economic environment favorable to private enterprise ?
but such debates can be fruitful only if they recognize the economic and political constraints under which modern states operate . indeed , the role of the state is made more complicated by the fact that market regulation is becoming less national and more transnational .
instead of throwing up our hands in despair , we should adhere to a distinction dear to the great German sociologist Max Weber , for now is a time when the ethics of responsibility must prevail over the ethics of conviction .
the Re-Education of Hong Kong
Hong KONG – After less than 100 days in office , C.Y. Leung , Hong Kong ’ s new Chief Executive , is already in political intensive care . in record time , he has managed to lose his veneer of competence , credibility , and steely leadership .
another was found to have been a slumlord who owned illegal cage-like flats that he blamed entirely on his wife , denying any involvement whatsoever . Leung himself was caught with several illegal structures in his house , a violation that he exploited successfully against his rival , Henry Tang , in the election campaign .
Leung has also distinguished himself by inciting a large swathe of school teachers and students to stage massive street protests against his hasty effort to insert a “ national education ” program into the school curriculum in order to “ reconnect ” Hong Kong ’ s young people with the motherland . for tens of thousands of student protesters , many with their parents in tow , the potential death of an honest education was too much to bear .
the goal of the program , inherited from the previous administration , is a good one : expand knowledge among the young about modern China . but , as Tang correctly pointed out in response to a question about the protests , the “ devil is in the details . ”
what triggered the uproar was the appearance of a “ model ” textbook , financed by the government and published by a pro-China think tank . the textbook contains mostly propaganda , including assertions that China ’ s one-party system is wonderful , whereas multiparty democracy as practiced in the United States has created harmful social turbulence .
he has also given the schools flexibility concerning when and perhaps how to introduce it . since nearly all schools are dependent on government subsidies , the grant of flexibility is widely perceived to be a tactical delay .
the protesters , led by a 15-year-old student , now a folk hero , have retreated , but that , too , is a tactical decision . the students have promised to continue to fight the program until it is scrapped .
but why does China ’ s government seek to impose the curriculum in the first place ? after all , Hong Kong has one of the world ’ s most educated populations : the city has , in per capita terms , perhaps more graduates of the world ’ s top 20 universities than anywhere outside of Manhattan .
while dissent is the lifeblood of any open society , for China it is a dangerous poison . moreover , China fears that Hong Kong , with a population of less than eight million , might present a systemic problem as an alternative form of government , even though many Communists and their allies hold key positions in Hong Kong ’ s private and public sectors .
few in Hong Kong are buying the political elite ’ s mantra that the national education program is the “ right ” thing to do . they know that practically all of the ruling elite ’ s children attend expensive schools in the United States and the United Kingdom , where they would be shielded from the mindless drivel at home .
the daughter of Xi Jinping , the presumptive future leader who has now reemerged from an unexplained absence , is attending Harvard under an assumed name . disgraced ex-Politburo member Bo Xilai ’ s hard-partying son , Bo Guagua , attended Harrow , Winston Churchill ’ s alma mater , then Oxford and Harvard .
as a result , more and more young people are turning to street demonstrations to make their voices heard . and , while no one in Hong Kong wants independence from China , continued strong-arm tactics to force Hong Kong to “ love ” China could begin to inspire such sentiments .
he claimed that he had only Hong Kong ’ s interest in mind within the limits of China ’ s “ one country , two systems ” formula . so far , however , he seems inclined to make one of those systems resemble the other .
but China ’ s national interest is to ensure that Hong Kong remains a first-rate city , modern and open . pulling Hong Kong down , in the name of patriotism , can only impede the advance to modernity that all of China needs to become truly great .
the Refugee Dilemma
one reason Greek Cypriots rejected last April UN Secretary General Kofi Annan &apos;s plan for the reunification of Cyprus was that an overwhelming majority of them felt it did not do justice to the claims of refugees displaced during the 1974 Turkish invasion . this was also one of the few occasions when international public opinion became aware that there was a refugee problem on the island , because few people knew that refugees from that war still exist .
when Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 after an abortive attempt by the Greek military junta in Athens to carry out Enosis ( unification with Greece ) , 250,000 or so Greek Cypriots were uprooted from their homes . some fled in terror from the invading army , some were expelled - the usual complex , morally problematic picture that emerges in such situations .
although overwhelmed , the Greek Cypriot community reacted with humanity , solidarity , and prudence . initially , refugees camps were set up , but the Greek Cypriot government decided that while it will not surrender the refugees &apos; claim eventually to return to their homes in the North , it would do its utmost in the interim not to leave them vegetating in squalid camps .
no UN-sponsored refugee agency was established to help the refugees . instead , with some international help , but mostly out of its own resources , the Republic of Cyprus - a small , then not very prosperous country that was devastated by war - launched a re-settlement and rehabilitation program as a national project .
within a few years , the refugees were absorbed into the economy and society of the southern , Greek Cypriot sector of the island . as in post-World War II West Germany , much of the current prosperity in Cyprus today is an outcome of the boost the economy received from the absorption of refugees .
anyone visiting the Greek Cypriot part of the island nowadays will not find refugee camps : most of the millions of tourists are unaware of the fact that more than a third of the Greek Cypriots they encounter are refugees or descendants of refugees . the Greek Cypriot community can justly be proud of the way they handled the humanitarian and social problems of the refugees , without at any point surrendering their claims to the lands they lost .
not one incident of Greek Cypriot terrorism or violence against Turkish occupation has occurred in more than a quarter of a century . this is also one of the reasons few people have ever heard about the Greek Cypriot refugees .
these leaders would do better to look across the Mediterranean at Cyprus and see how - without giving up claims to disputed land - refugees can live in dignity and honor . but then again , the Republic of Cyprus is a democracy , while the Palestinians have not been able to emancipate themselves from the violent militarized option that has brought them such misery .
the Renminbi Goes Forth
Beijing – In June , the Peoples ’ Bank of China ( PBC ) , China ’ s central bank , announced an end to the renminbi ’ s 23-month-old peg to the dollar and a return to the pre-crisis exchange-rate regime adopted in July 2005 . so far , however , the RMB ’ s appreciation against the dollar has been slow .
it is hard to argue that the RMB is not undervalued , given China ’ s large and persistent current-account and capital-account surpluses . but , despite ending the dollar peg , faster appreciation of the RMB seems unlikely for the foreseeable future .
RMB appreciation should have started earlier and at a faster pace , when China ’ s trade surplus was much smaller and its growth was much less dependent on exports . delay has made current-account rebalancing via RMB appreciation costly .
in the first seven months of 2010 , China ’ s trade surplus was $ 84 billion , down 21.2 % from January-July 2009 . this large , steady fall in the country ’ s trade surplus makes the Chinese government hesitant to allow the RMB to appreciate significantly , for fear of the lagged impact on the trade balance .
the PBC knows that rapid deterioration in America ’ s fiscal position and continual worsening in its external balance may create an irresistible temptation for the US to inflate away its debt burden . the more the PBC intervenes , the larger the national welfare losses that China may suffer in the future .
moreover , the increase in China ’ s overall price level – and wage levels in particular – has caused the RMB to strengthen steadily in real terms , reducing ( to a certain extent ) the need for nominal RMB appreciation . true , commerce ministry officials recently declared their wish to see a further fall of China ’ s trade surplus in 2010 .
at the same time , the effect of currency appreciation on the trade balance should not be exaggerated . the RMB appreciated by 18.6 % in real effective terms , and by 16 % in dollar terms , from June 2005 to August 2008 .
for China ’ s , the income effect of global demand is significantly larger than the price effect of the exchange rate . the fall in China ’ s trade surplus since late 2008 is attributable mainly to the global slowdown and the stimulus package introduced by the Chinese government , rather than to changes in the RMB ’ s exchange rate .
with a fast-rising RMB , net capital outflows will increase , which is what Japan experienced after the Plaza Accord of 1985 pushed the yen upward . as a result , balance-of-payments equilibrium would be reached at a certain exchange-rate level , but a current-account surplus ( albeit smaller ) would still exist .
America should not pin too much hope on a weakening dollar to correct its trade imbalances . for the US , the fundamental cause of imbalances is not a strong dollar , but America ’ s over-consumption and over-borrowing .
but if the US fails to narrow its savings gap , its current-account deficit will not disappear , regardless of where the dollar goes . whether America can achieve decent growth while keeping its current-account deficit in check depends on whether it can reinvigorate its ability to innovate and create , thereby restoring competitiveness and creating demand at the same time .
for both China and America , the RMB-dollar exchange rate is important for achieving growth and a more balanced current account . but that dual objective requires structural change in the Chinese and US economies .
the Resisted Rise of Segolene Royal
while the race is not over , Nicolas Sarkozy has emerged as the consistent favorite in the polls , as well as of those who declared “ him ” nearly defeated in early December . the new consensus can be described as follows : Ségolène Royal cannot defeat Nicolas Sarkozy , but Sarkozy can defeat himself .
why has the Socialist candidate , the first woman who had a serious chance to be elected President of France , fallen from grace so quickly ? and why has Sarkozy proved to be so resilient , despite the often negative passions aroused by his personality ?
she is beautiful , energetic , resolute , and in many ways surprising . indeed , on issues such as law and order , respect for authority , and nationalism , one finds her positions far from what one would expect of a Socialist candidate .
whereas Sarkozy has managed to impose himself on the right without the support of Jacques Chirac , the Socialist heavyweights cannot fully convince themselves to come out behind Royal . her defeat would be theirs , too , but their resentment over losing the nomination to her is so far proving stronger than their political survival instincts .
Royal ’ s emphasis on the concept of participatory democracy – “ Tell me what you want , I will be your spokesperson ” – has so far shown itself to have limited appeal . voters like to be consulted , and citizens love to express themselves , but at the end of the day , they want a leader , someone they can trust .
two months before the vote , the presidential campaign has demonstrated that the modernization , if not “ Americanization , ” of French politics ( for example , heavy use of the Internet ) has taken hold . but the campaign is also proving the resilience of “ classical politics . ”
at the same time , Sarkozy has been able to emerge as the natural leader of the right partly because Chirac has been less of a liability than many people , including the experts , predicted . indeed , the reverse seems to be true , which perhaps reflects the tendency of French voters to adopt a positive view of departing presidents .
it is as if France were now seized by a kind of nostalgic generosity toward a presidency that had been marked by suspicion and derision . Chirac is not about to present himself as a candidate to divide the conservative camp , and the new leniency surrounding his record may actually benefit Sarkozy , his impatient and rebellious heir .
in fact , the persistence of strong reservations about both Royal and Sarkozy helps explain the surge in popularity for a third candidate , Francois Bayrou , a traditional centrist , pro-European politician . Bayrou has never had it so good , but , barring the unlikely collapse of one of the two leading candidates ’ campaigns , he will fail to qualify for the second-round runoff .
an anybody-but-Sarkozy reflex may exist in some circles of French society , but , in order to prevail , a credible alternative is required . so far , Royal has failed to play that role .
the Resistible Rise of Asia ?
new DELHI – A favorite theme in international debate nowadays is whether Asia ’ s rise signifies the West ’ s decline . but the current focus on economic malaise in Europe and the United States is distracting attention from the many serious challenges that call into question Asia ’ s continued success .
to be sure , today ’ s ongoing global power shifts are primarily linked to Asia ’ s phenomenal economic rise , the speed and scale of which have no parallel in world history . with the world ’ s fastest-growing economies , fastest-rising military expenditures , fiercest resource competition , and most serious hot spots , Asia obviously holds the key to the future global order .
but Asia faces major constraints . it must cope with entrenched territorial and maritime disputes , such as in the South China Sea ; harmful historical legacies that weigh down its most important interstate relationships ; increasingly fervent nationalism ; growing religious extremism ; and sharpening competition over water and energy .
regional consultation mechanisms remain weak . differences persist over whether a security architecture or community should extend across Asia , or be confined to an ill-defined “ East Asia . ”
one central concern is that , unlike Europe ’ s bloody wars of the first half of the twentieth century , which made war there unthinkable today , the wars in Asia in the second half of the twentieth century only accentuated bitter rivalries . several interstate wars have been fought in Asia since 1950 , when both the Korean War and the annexation of Tibet started , without resolving the underlying Asian disputes .
a 2010 Pentagon report cites Chinese military preemption in 1950 , 1962 , 1969 , and 1979 in the name of strategic defense . there was also China ’ s seizure of the Paracel Islands from Vietnam in 1974 , and the 1995 occupation of Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands , amid protests by the Philippines .
indeed , not since Japan rose to world-power status during the reign of the Meiji Emperor ( 1867-1912 ) has another non-Western power emerged with such potential to shape the global order . but there is an important difference : Japan ’ s rise was accompanied by the other Asian civilizations ’ decline .
although China now has displaced Japan as the world ’ s second largest economy , Japan will remain a strong power for the foreseeable future . on a per capita basis , Japan remains nine times richer than China , and it possesses Asia ’ s largest naval fleet and its most advanced high-tech industries .
but its defense spending has grown almost twice as fast as its GDP . and , by picking territorial fights with its neighbors and pursuing a muscular foreign policy , China ’ s leaders are compelling other Asian states to work more closely with the US and each other .
in fact , China seems to be on the same path that made Japan an aggressive , militaristic state , with tragic consequences for the region – &amp; nbsp ; and for Japan . the &amp; nbsp ; Meiji Restoration created a powerful military under the slogan “ Enrich the country and strengthen the military . ”
more broadly , Asia ’ s power dynamics are likely to remain fluid , with new or shifting alliances and strengthened military capabilities continuing to challenge regional stability . for example , as China , India , and Japan maneuver for strategic advantage , they are transforming their mutual relations in a way that portends closer strategic engagement between India and Japan , and sharper competition between them and China .
the future will not belong to Asia merely because it is the world ’ s largest , most populous , and fastest-developing continent . size is not necessarily an asset .
in addition to its growing political and natural-resource challenges , Asia has made the mistake of overemphasizing GDP growth to the exclusion of other indices of development . as a result , Asia is becoming more unequal , corruption is spreading , domestic discontent is rising , and environmental degradation is becoming a serious problem .
Asia ’ s challenges are graver than those facing Europe , which embodies comprehensive development more than any other part of the world . despite China ’ s aura of inevitability , it is far from certain that Asia , with its pressing internal challenges , will be able to spearhead global growth and shape a new world order .
the Resource Curse Revisited
there is a curious phenomenon that economists call the resource curse - so named because , on average , countries with large endowments of natural resources perform worse than countries that are less well endowed . yet some countries with abundant natural resources do perform better than others , and some have done well .
thirty years ago , Indonesia and Nigeria - both dependent on oil - had comparable per capita incomes . today , Indonesia &apos;s per capita income is four times that of Nigeria .
yet Botswana averaged 8.7 % annual economic growth over the past thirty years , while Sierra Leone plunged into civil strife . the failures in the oil-rich Middle East are legion .
economists put forward three reasons for the dismal performance of some richly endowed countries :
at other times simple rent-seeking behavior by officials , aided and abetted by outsiders , is the outcome . it is cheaper to bribe a government to provide resources at below-market prices than to invest and develop an industry , so it is no surprise that some firms succumb to this temptation .
( as the old adage has it , banks only like to lend to those who do not need money . ) Economic activity is thus even more volatile than commodity prices , and much of the gains made in a boom unravels in the bust that follows .
• Third , oil and other natural resources , while perhaps a source of wealth , do not create jobs by themselves , and unfortunately , they often crowd out other economic sectors . for example , an inflow of oil money often leads to currency appreciation - a phenomenon called the Dutch Disease .
the Netherlands , after its discovery of North Sea gas and oil , found itself plagued with growing unemployment and workforce disability ( many of those who could not get jobs found disability benefits to be more generous than unemployment benefits . ) When the exchange rate soars as a result of resource booms , countries cannot export manufactured or agriculture goods , and domestic producers cannot compete with an onslaught of imports .
two thirds of the people in Venezuela , the Latin American country with the largest oil deposits , live in poverty . no wonder that they are demanding that the small group of those who benefit from the country &apos;s wealth start to share it .
fortunately , as we have become aware of these problems , we have learned much about what can be done about them . democratic , consensual , and transparent processes - such as those in Botswana - are more likely to ensure that the fruits of a country &apos;s wealth are equitably and well spent .
we also know that stabilization funds - which set aside some of the money earned when prices are high - can help reduce the economic volatility associated with natural resource prices . moreover , such fluctuations are amplified by borrowing in good years , so countries should resist foreign lenders who try to persuade them of the virtues of such capital flows .
the Dutch disease , however , is one of the more intractable consequences of oil and resource wealth , at least for poor countries . in principle , it is easy to avoid currency appreciation : keep the foreign exchange earned from , say , oil exports out of the country .
Nigeria has proposed creating stabilization funds , and , in the future , it will sell its natural resources in transparent , competitive bidding processes . most importantly , the Nigerians are taking measures to ensure that the fruits of this endowment are invested , so that as the country &apos;s natural resources are depleted , its real wealth - fixed and human capital - is increased .
similarly , transparency would be encouraged if only payments that are fully documented were tax deductible . violent conflict is fed and its effects worsened by massive sales of arms by Western governments to developing countries .
abundant natural resources can and should be a blessing , not a curse . we know what must be done .
the Responsibility to Protect Comes of Age
new YORK – Good news not only sells less well than bad news , but also often seems harder to believe . reaction to Harvard psychologist Stephen Pinker ’ s majestic new book , The Better Angels of Our Nature , is a case in point .
in 800 meticulously argued and documented pages , Pinker shows that , over the course of history , there has been a dramatic decline in violence , both domestically and internationally – and that this downward trend is continuing through the post-Cold War years . but the response of many reviewers to Pinker ’ s work has been incomprehension , denial , or a tenacious focus on individual horror stories , as though they somehow change the larger picture .
many will be similarly slow to accept that when it comes to the most conscience-shocking classes of violence – genocide , ethnic cleansing , and other mass atrocities – dramatic progress has been made recently . those gains culminated in the interventions , unthinkable a decade ago , that the United Nations Security Council authorized this year to stop unfolding human-rights catastrophes in Côte d ’ Ivoire and Libya .
the new concept also made clear that international protective action meant military coercion only in extreme and unavoidable cases . the normal sequence would be assistance , persuasion , and non-military pressure like sanctions and criminal prosecution .
for some time after 2005 , it was possible to argue that all of this was hot air , and that fast , decisive action to respond to genocidal atrocities would remain as unlikely as ever . the jury remained out even after Kenya in early 2008 , when horrific post-election violence was widely considered an RtoP case , and former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan led a successful diplomatic mission to persuade ethnic-group leaders to quell the storm .
the two Security Council resolutions on Libya in February and March were textbook examples of a phased response to an increasingly desperate situation . invoking RtoP , that response began with a warning and the threat of sanctions and prosecution at the International Criminal Court , and only subsequently allowed military force to protect civilians .
other developments , both before and since , have reinforced and embedded the RtoP norm . even as the NATO-led intervention in Libya was being widely criticized for overreaching its narrow mandate , a major General Assembly debate in July 2011 reaffirmed overwhelming support among UN member states for the RtoP concept , in all of its dimensions .
moreover , there have been important institutional developments in terms of early-warning mechanisms and civilian and military preparedness , not least with President Barack Obama ’ s recent initiation in the United States of an interagency Atrocities Prevention Board .
nobody denies that challenges remain in ensuring that RtoP is applied effectively and consistently . an immediate need is to counter the perception that any condemnatory response to an unfolding RtoP situation means stepping onto a slippery slope to military confrontation – a perception that Russia and China heavily milked in seeking to justify their vote against an early-stage Security Council resolution on Syria .
the best way to make that point would be to revive the dormant debate about adopting narrow guidelines for military intervention , as recommended by my commission and Secretary-General Annan prior to the UN vote in 2005 . clear criteria like “ last resort , ” “ proportionality , ” and “ balance of consequences ” would make it harder to use cynical diversionary tactics in the Security Council and elsewhere .
I have learned from long experience that to be optimistic about almost anything in international affairs is to run the risk of being thought ignorant or naïve , if not demented . but , on the issue of mass-atrocity crimes – where the international community has long had good reason for shame – real optimism is now justified .
the Cooperation Crisis
but the shift to a multipolar world order has not bolstered multilateralism . in fact , the opposite is true : the logic of national sovereignty has staged a comeback , with major economies consistently undermining cooperation on issues ranging from security to trade to climate change .
consider the muddle in the United Nations Security Council over Syria ’ s civil war . just two years ago , the Council approved a resolution authorizing a military intervention in Libya – the first resolution to implement the “ responsibility to protect ” ( R2P ) principle , which the general assembly adopted unanimously in 2005 .
but the emerging powers soon came to believe that the West had used the protection of Libya ’ s civilian population as a pretext for regime change ( though , realistically , it would have been impossible to protect the population without toppling Muammar el-Qaddafi ’ s government ) . now , these countries are largely rejecting R2P , viewing it as a device employed by Western governments to legitimize their attempts to infringe upon national sovereignty .
Brazil has attempted to address the issue by crafting a resolution that would decouple the R2P mandate from the use of force – effectively eliminating the possibility that the doctrine could be applied . for their part , Russia and China have blocked three resolutions condemning the Syrian regime , and Russia has worked hard – with evident success – to derail any military intervention in Syria .
to be sure , many countries ­ now believe that the West is going too far in challenging state sovereignty , with even European countries like Germany recoiling at the prospect of military confrontation . at the G-20 summit in early September , for example , US President Barack Obama struggled to convince ten states to sign a declaration on Syria that did not even mention the use of force .
but viewing intervention in Syria within the paradigm of Western messianism is a mistake . after all , in Syria , as in Libya , the forces challenging the government are not a creature of Western manipulation .
in 2008 , the US abandoned its commitment to the World Trade Organization ’ s Doha Round of global trade negotiations . while the decision followed a technical disagreement with India , it was driven largely by the belief that any agreement would benefit China more than the US .
but , while the world may be happy to pretend that bilateral cooperation will revitalize multilateralism , nobody should be fooled . the WTO will survive , but its centrality in the trade system is rapidly diminishing .
even cooperation on climate change is crumbling , with the US and China rejecting the multilateral , top-down approach to policymaking . this implies the end of the Kyoto Protocol model , which , like the Doha model , is based on a detailed agenda , established according to specific and ambitious targets , with all relevant actors then compelled to negotiate each topic .
rather than being subject to an internationally agreed standard , the US and China want the fight against climate change to begin with countries ’ individual commitments . but this new , bottom-up framework , in which states determine the conditions for a multilateral agreement , lacks an authority to establish standards .
multilateralism requires minimal consensus on global rules and norms among all major powers .
the Return of 1948
Tel AVIV – The forthcoming United Nation ’ s conference commemorating the 60th anniversary of UNRWA ( The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees ) could not come at a better moment . the restitution of lands occupied in 1967 will obviously continue to be indispensable to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , but it is the legacy of the 1948 war that both parties to the conflict have now put at the center of the debate .
oddly , it was Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu who , by requesting that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state , reopened the 1948 file . that demand brought the quest for peace back to its fundamentals , where the question of the refugees is bound to play a central role .
Netanyahu ’ s intention was essentially to force the Palestinians into admitting that the right of return of refugees applies only to the Palestinian state , not Israel . but the true significance of his demand lies in that it ’ s being pronounced at a time when Prime Minister Salam Fayaad ’ s policies are posing a genuine challenge to the Palestinian national movement to choose between an ethos of vindication and one of state building .
it is as if the voice of the diaspora were being silenced in Palestine . conspicuously , the recently elected PLO Executive Committee – which in the past consisted exclusively of representatives of the Palestinian Diaspora – now has only one member from the diaspora , a delegate from Lebanon .
in Zionism , the Jewish community in Palestine was the focus of decision making , with the Jewish Diaspora a strategic back-up . but the situation was reversed in the case of the Palestinians : the ethos of the diaspora , with the plight of the refugees at its center , has been the beating heart of the Palestinian cause and the focus of decision making for the national movement .
as a result , the Palestinian community in the occupied territories was always subservient to the primacy of the Palestinian Diaspora . when it sought to assume a leading role – during the first Intifada in 1987 , for example , its effort was suppressed by the diaspora-based PLO .
Fayaadism , by contrast , seeks the “ Zionization ” of the Palestinian national movement . it imbues the Palestinian cause with a positive ethos of nation- and state-building by superseding Palestinian nationalism ’ s diaspora-centered preoccupations – and thereby transcending the paralyzing obsession with a never-fulfilled vindication of rights and justice .
in the peace process as it has been conducted up to now , the Israelis always wanted to concentrate on the issues of 1967 – that is , land and security . the Palestinians , however , always wanted to return to the issues of 1948 : refugees , dispersion , and what Akram Hanya , a close Arafat confidant , defined as the need “ to make the Israelis face the tribunal of history . ”
it looks as if now the roles have been inversed . precisely when Israel managed to domesticate the Palestinian national movement by forcing it to abandon its revolutionary path in favor of state-building and economic development – a reorientation undertaken by Zionism as well – the Israelis decided to draw the Palestinians back to the fundamentals of the conflict .
indeed , despite of the rise of Fayaadism , the Palestinian national movement will be careful not to betray its real sources of legitimacy : the ethos of dispossession and the refugee . the decisions taken at the last Fatah Convention were explicit in calling for the refugees to “ return to their homes and cities . ”
the Palestinians are attempting to hold the stick at both ends , claiming before the world their endorsement of the two-state solution while calling for the right of return at the same time . any sober Palestinian leadership must know by now that the rhetorical promise of a return to an abandoned house and to the olive tree is an irresponsible mirage that fundamentally contradicts the rationale for a separate Palestinian state .
the Palestinians must align their national conversation with what is realizable , while Israel must resolve its own contradictions and address the refugee problem in a way that secures the legitimacy and durability of a future peace agreement with the Palestinians . because Israel will have to implement practical measures of resettlement and compensation that will not be based on an automatic right of physical return , a symbol of genuine moral compensation is also called for .
instead of suppressing the memory of the refugees , Israel needs to recognize that in 1948 the land was bisected by the sword , and that the Jewish state came into being partly because of the massive uprooting and dispossession of Palestinian communities . Israel should develop enough self-confidence in its solidity as a nation to integrate into its schools ’ curriculum the tragedy of the Palestinian Naqbah .
Israel ’ s consolation would be that the Palestinians , too , will have to come to terms with their share of responsibility for the calamities that have befallen them . only an acceptable deal on the refugees can definitely close the 1948 file – and only then can the conflict in Palestine end .
the Return of American Realism
new YORK – There are many recurring debates in American foreign policy – for example , isolationism versus internationalism , and unilateralism versus multilateralism . but no debate is more persistent than that between those who believe that American foreign policy ’ s principal purpose should be to influence the external behavior of other states and those who hold that it should be to shape their internal nature .
during the Cold War , there were those who argued that the United States should try to “ roll back ” the Soviet Union , bring down the communist system , and replace it with democratic capitalism . others deemed this to be too dangerous in an era defined by nuclear weapons , and the US opted instead for a policy of containment , working to limit the reach of Soviet power and influence .
George W. Bush was the most recent “ idealist ” proponent of making democracy promotion the main priority for US foreign policy . Bush embraced the so-called “ democratic peace ” theory , which holds that democracies not only treat their own citizens better , but also act better toward their neighbors and others .
it was , of course , his father , George H.W. Bush , who was a strong representative of the alternative , “ realist ” approach to American foreign policy .
George W. Bush went to war with Iraq in 2003 to change the government . he expected regime change in Baghdad to lead to a democratic Iraq , a development that would in turn transform the region when people elsewhere in the Arab world saw this example and forced their own governments to follow suit .
by contrast , in the earlier Iraq war , the first President Bush , after amassing an unprecedented international coalition that succeeded in liberating Kuwait , did not press ahead to Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein and his government , despite the urging of many that he do just that .
nor did he intervene on behalf of the Shia and Kurdish uprisings that erupted just after the war ended early in 1991 . to him , intervention would have placed US soldiers in the midst of a complex domestic struggle , one that would have cost enormous resources to sort out if it could be sorted out at all .
the new US policy toward Afghanistan makes no mention of trying to transform that country into a democracy . on the contrary , as Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated before Congress in January , “ If we set ourselves the objective of creating some sort of Central Asian Valhalla over there , we will lose . ”
for his part , Obama said in March that “ We have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle , and defeat al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan , and to prevent their return to either country in the future . ”
this shift is also evident in US policy toward China . speaking during her trip to Asia in February , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made clear that human rights issues would be a secondary concern in US-China relations .
while encouraging the rule of law and the growth of civil society , the US still needs to work with other governments , democratic and otherwise . pressing problems , such as the economic crisis , nuclear proliferation , and climate change , will not wait .
the US and the Soviet Union cooperated in limited ways ( for example , in controlling nuclear arms ) despite fundamental differences . today , the US and authoritarian China have mutually beneficial trade and financial ties , and have shown on occasion that they can work together on strategic issues , for example in shaping North Korea ’ s behavior .
but democracy promotion is too uncertain a proposition , and the world too dangerous a place , for it to occupy center stage in what the United States does . Barack Obama ’ s foreign policy will thus resemble that of George Bush – the father , that is , not the son .
Bretton Woods III
Singapore – Many analysts and observers believe that the global imbalances that characterized the world economy in the years before the 2008 crisis have substantially dissipated . but , while it is true that China ’ s current-account surpluses and America ’ s deficits have somewhat moderated since then , have the imbalances really been corrected ?
in 2007 , the United States had a savings rate of 14.6 % of GDP , but an investment rate of 19.6 % , generating a current-account deficit . by contrast , China had a fixed investment rate of 41.7 % of GDP and a savings rate of 51.9 % , reflected in a large surplus .
since 2007 , the US current-account deficit has narrowed , but not because of a higher savings rate . rather , the external deficit has been squeezed by a collapse in investment activity , while America ’ s overall savings rate has fallen below 13 % of GDP , owing to worsening government finances .
American businesses have postponed much-needed capital spending and , with American airports and bridges in appalling condition by developed-country standards , investment in infrastructure is crucial as well . indeed , it is very likely that reviving growth will lead to larger current-account deficits , even if the savings rate improves and domestic energy production curtails oil and gas imports .
in order to sustain growth , it needs to continue to invest half of its $ 9 trillion annual GDP – no easy task for a country that already has brand new highways and airports . in fact , over the next decade , as China attempts to move up the value chain into services and adjusts to a shrinking workforce , its investment requirements will shrink – and its investment rate will fall sharply .
of course , China ’ s savings rate will also decline , but Japan ’ s experience since the 1980 ’ s demonstrates how a sharp fall in investment can generate large and persistent current-account surpluses , even when the savings rate is falling and the currency is appreciating . indeed , a stronger currency can paradoxically feed external surpluses , while discouraging investment in export-oriented industries .
the implication is that the post-crisis global economy will not be characterized by balance , but by a return to large macroeconomic imbalances . but , although many economists will consider this problematic , history shows that symbiotic imbalances have characterized virtually all periods of global economic expansion .
the Roman Empire ran a persistent trade deficit with India for centuries . although the resulting outflow of gold caused monetary debasement in the Roman Empire , Indo-Roman trade remained the backbone of the global economy .
the resulting flood of liquidity caused a global boom that benefited economies from Elizabethan England to Mughal India . and 1870-1913 , another period of rapid growth and globalization , was not characterized by balance ; it was funded by the United Kingdom , acting as the world ’ s “ bank . ”
in the last 60 years , the US has underpinned global growth by running persistent current-account deficits . under the Bretton Woods system , the US ran deficits that enabled war-torn Europe and Japan to rebuild .
the system broke down when European countries , particularly France , decided to stop funding those deficits . but the economic model persisted , with Asian economies stepping in to finance the US deficits , while using the US market to grow rapidly .
clearly , periods of global growth are almost always characterized by symbiotic imbalances . but , while each of these episodes was characterized by macroeconomic distortions caused by the imbalances , they lasted for years , or even decades .
it is likely that China will soon return to running very large current-account surpluses – potentially large enough to fund the US , with plenty left over for the rest of the world . as this capital cascades through the global financial system , it will re-inflate the economy .
in the “ Bretton Woods III ” system , China will transform from “ factory to the world ” to “ investor to the world . ” Like all imbalanced systems , it will have its distortions , but the arrangement could last for many years .
the New Mercantilist Challenge
but its intellectual victory has blinded us to the great appeal – and frequent success – of mercantilist practices . in fact , mercantilism remains alive and well , and its continuing conflict with liberalism is likely to be a major force shaping the future of the global economy .
today , mercantilism is typically dismissed as an archaic and blatantly erroneous set of ideas about economic policy . and , in their heyday , mercantilists certainly did defend some very odd notions , chief among which was the view that national policy ought to be guided by the accumulation of precious metals – gold and silver .
Smith showed , in particular , that money should not be confused for wealth . as he put it , “ the wealth of a country consists , not in its gold and silver only , but in its lands , houses , and consumable goods of all different kinds . ”
but it is more accurate to think of mercantilism as a different way to organize the relationship between the state and the economy – a vision that holds no less relevance today than it did in the eighteenth century . mercantilist theorists such as Thomas Mun were in fact strong proponents of capitalism ; they just propounded a different model than liberalism .
so it advocates a strict separation between the state and private business . mercantilism , by contrast , offers a corporatist vision in which the state and private business are allies and cooperate in pursuit of common objectives , such as domestic economic growth or national power .
lagging economies have not failed to notice that mercantilism can be their friend . even in Britain , classical liberalism arrived only in the mid-nineteenth century – that is , after the country had become the world ’ s dominant industrial power .
for liberals , consumers are king . the ultimate objective of economic policy is to increase households ’ consumption potential , which requires giving them unhindered access to the cheapest-possible goods and services .
for them , a sound economy requires a sound production structure . and consumption needs to be underpinned by high employment at adequate wages .
the logic of the liberal approach is that the economic benefits of trade arise from imports : the cheaper the imports , the better , even if the result is a trade deficit . mercantilists , however , view trade as a means of supporting domestic production and employment , and prefer to spur exports rather than imports .
today ’ s China is the leading bearer of the mercantilist torch , though Chinese leaders would never admit it &amp; # 160 ; – too much opprobrium still attaches to the term . much of China ’ s economic miracle is the product of an activist government that has supported , stimulated , and openly subsidized industrial producers – both domestic and foreign .
although China phased out many of its explicit export subsidies as a condition of membership in the World Trade Organization ( which it joined in 2001 ) , mercantilism ’ s support system remains largely in place . in particular , the government has managed the exchange rate to maintain manufacturers ’ profitability , resulting in a sizable trade surplus ( which has come down recently , but largely as a result of an economic slowdown ) .
a recent study by the economists Fabrice Defever and Alejandro Riaño of the University of Nottingham puts the “ losses ” to China at around 3 % of Chinese income , and gains to the rest of the world at around 1 % of global income . from the mercantilist perspective , however , these are simply the costs of building a modern economy and setting the stage for long-term prosperity .
as the example of export subsidies shows , the two models can co-exist happily in the world economy . liberals should be happy to have their consumption subsidized by mercantilists .
indeed , that , in a nutshell , is the story of the last six decades : a succession of Asian countries managed to grow by leaps and bounds by applying different variants of mercantilism . governments in rich countries for the most part looked the other way while Japan , South Korea , Taiwan , and China protected their home markets , appropriated “ intellectual property , ” subsidized their producers , and managed their currencies .
the liberal model has become severely tarnished , owing to the rise in inequality and the plight of the middle class in the West , together with the financial crisis that deregulation spawned . medium-term growth prospects for the American and European economies range from moderate to bleak .
as a result , the new economic environment will produce more tension than accommodation between countries pursuing liberal and mercantilist paths . it may also reignite long-dormant debates about the type of capitalism that produces the greatest prosperity .
the Return of Mexico ’ s Nemesis
the PRI ’ s candidate , Enrique Peña Nieto , holds an insurmountable lead late in the campaign . many Mexicans , as well as the country ’ s foreign friends , fear that this turn of events heralds a return to the authoritarian , corrupt , and discredited past that Mexico had left behind when the National Action Party ’ s candidate , Vicente Fox , won the presidency in 2000 .
Mexico has changed immensely since 1994 , the last time a PRI president was elected . if Peña Nieto wins , he will have to deal with a strong opposition bloc in Congress , and in all likelihood with minority status for the PRI , at least in the lower house .
meanwhile , Mexico ’ s media are freer , better , and stronger than ever , even if on occasion the quality of their output leaves much to be desired . the country ’ s civil society has become more organized , more powerful , and more vibrant .
perhaps most important , Mexico , for the first time in its history , has a truly independent and effective Supreme Court . this occasionally made life miserable for Fox and Calderón , but has made things better for ordinary Mexicans in every walk of life .
today , the country is enmeshed in a web of free-trade agreements and other international instruments that have locked in its open economy , orthodox macroeconomic policies , and commitment to democratic rule . it is subject to constant , intrusive , and welcome foreign scrutiny .
whatever his personal beliefs , if Peña Nieto wins , he will be the PRI ’ s first-ever democratically elected president – the first to become head of state because he won more votes at the polls , not because his predecessor hand-picked him . whether or not this matters is difficult to say , but morally , politically , and personally , accountability counts ; in its absence , anything goes .
in the end , one either believes that free and fair elections , respect for individual rights and liberties , and rotation in power are the essence of democracy , or one does not . the PRI ’ s comeback , under Mexico ’ s current rules , may not be ideal for the country , but it is not a restoration .
if Mexico is not ready for the PRI ’ s return to power , then we all did our job poorly : we did not build the institutions , the civil society , the political parties , and the international covenants that would have ensured that only democratic players remained in the political game .
the Return of Post-Communism
but in 2006 , after more than a decade of striving for acceptance by the West , the moral and political vacuum left by communism was fully exposed . can a new balance between the democratic ethos and the undertows of the region ’ s political history and culture be found ?
in Poland , for example , the prevailing mix of Catholicism and nationalism made society particularly resistant to communism ( certainly in comparison with the egalitarian , social-democratic ethos of pre-war Czechoslovakia ) . but these anti-communist antibodies also worked against the universal acceptance among Poles of liberal democracy .
in the Czech Republic , a minority right-wing government has not gained a confidence vote in Parliament after six months of bickering . Bulgaria ’ s entry into the European Union was heralded by a presidential race between an ex-communist ( the victor , who claimed to like the EU ) and a proto-fascist ( who says he hates Turks , Gypsies , and Jews ) .
according to a recent Gallup International poll , Central and East Europeans are the most skeptical about democracy , which only about one-third of people trust . in contrast to a majority of West Europeans , East Europeans do not consider their elections free and fair .
but they are anti-liberal ; they accept democracy ’ s demand for the popular legitimacy , but reject its demand for constitutionalism ( the separation of powers ) . they do not believe that constitutional norms and representative democracy have primacy over values and “ legitimate ” popular grievances .
in Poland , the “ politics of values ” is based on the assumption that a “ moral order ” based on religion should prevail over the freedoms guaranteed by permissive liberalism on issues such as abortion , gay rights , and the death penalty . in Slovakia , the anti-liberal reaction applies also to the treatment of national minorities .
acute polarization is occurring everywhere , and it is here where the legacy of communist political culture is mostly keenly felt : an opponent is not someone with whom you argue or negotiate , but an enemy that you must destroy .
after 15 years of free-market policies , populists in Warsaw , Bratislava , and Budapest want to bring back the state . and , since even socialist parties pushed liberal economic policies , it is not surprising that the far right , with its nationalist and protectionist overtones , has hijacked the social question .
the populist challenge to the pro-market , pro-Western elite consensus that has prevailed in the region since 1990 takes two forms : an anti-corruption drive and “ de-communization . ”
moreover , these populists attack the EU as an elite-imposed project , while pro-European coalitions have become exhausted , disintegrating in the aftermath of EU accession in 2004 . significantly , the Polish , Czech , and Hungarian prime ministers resigned within days or weeks after fulfilling the “ historic ” task of “ returning to Europe . ”
populist nationalists present themselves as the only defenders of national identity and sovereignty against “ external threats , ” as Polish Premier Jaroslaw Kaczynski put it . their vision is a “ Christian Europe ” of “ sovereign nation-states ” that opposes the existing materialist , decadent , permissive , and supra-national model .
indeed , populism moves in cycles . populists come to power promising “ to clean house , ” but once they move in and become identified with the house and all its flaws , they fall back on clientelism and state capture by the ruling parties ( as we are now seeing in Poland ) rather than becoming more radical .
after all , populist nationalists have joined ( and since left ) government coalitions in Austria , Italy , Holland , and Denmark . and , while nationalist populism is a trans-European phenomenon , populism today , unlike in the 1930 ’ s , it does not hold itself out as an alternative to democracy .
the Return of Religion ?
Budapest – It ’ s a well-worn contrast : the United States is religious , Europe is secular . yet , in some respects , this clichéd opposition has actually been reversed recently : religion played virtually no role during the last American presidential elections , while in a range of different European countries major controversies about religion have flared up , suggesting that questions of faith are back at the center of European politics .
in particular , according to the twice-divorced self-confessed “ cultural Catholic , ” France should develop a “ positive secularism . ” In contrast to negative laïcité , which according to Sarkozy “ excludes and denounces , ” laïcité positive invites “ dialogue ” and recognizes the social benefits of religion .
in a much criticized speech in Rome at the end of 2007 , Sarkozy acknowledged the Christian roots of France , “ the eldest daughter of the Church ” ; he also praised Islam during a visit to Saudi Arabia . now he wants state subsidies for faith-based organizations – a policy proposal that upsets his many secularist critics .
the church supported the PP against a prime minister , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , whose advocacy of gay marriage , more relaxed divorce laws , and the removal of compulsory religion classes from the national curriculum upset many religious conservatives . Zapatero eventually felt it necessary to tell a Vatican envoy that Spanish bishops should stop meddling in the elections ( which he won ) .
in Italy , Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi precipitated a constitutional crisis by trying to rush through emergency legislation to prevent a comatose patient from being taken off life support . this reminded many observers of what the America ’ s Republican Party tried to do in order to demonstrate its “ pro-life commitments ” during George W. Bush ’ s presidency .
globally , there might be good reasons to talk about what sociologists describe as the rise of “ post-secular societies , ” but Europe remains the exception . what really explains these new public controversies surrounding religion is something else , something political : the dilemma in which right-wing and center-right European parties find themselves .
many of these parties used to advocate market radicalism , or at least strong doses of economic liberalization . not just since the financial crisis have they retreated from these positions and tried to fashion a gentler , more socially conscious image .
in fact , some intellectuals close to the right have long advocated an opening towards Europe ’ s Muslim immigrants and their descendants . where they can vote , so the argument goes , Muslim traditionalists would rather vote for a conservative party , even if it has Catholic roots , than for a secular left-wing party perceived as advocating loose morals .
this is not to say that all appeals to religion are just cynical election ploys . especially in the face of the financial crisis , religion has been presented as a source for what Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have called the project of “ moralizing capitalism . ”
but taking these traditions seriously would require much larger transformations of capitalism than even avowed Christian Democrats are prepared to contemplate , including a much wider distribution of ownership and mechanisms for involving workers in management . theories of “ red Toryism ” might go some way in this direction , but it remains to be seen whether they will ever translate into practice .
for the moment , the temptation is for the European right to find its “ new look ” through a selective appeal to religion – and wait and see whether it works as an electoral strategy . they should remember , though , that starting a Kulturkampf is to play with fire : it might be possible to instrumentalize religious passions for a time ; but such passions cannot permanently be controlled from above .
the Return of the French ?
Tunisia has been independent for 55 years , and Côte d ’ Ivoire for 51 years , yet France is once more playing a decisive role in these countries . naturally , many Africans are unconvinced that France is acting only to defend the lives of a few thousand of its citizens , rather than its economic and strategic interests , which are negligible for the former and null for the latter .
the damage that slavery and colonialism inflicted in these countries has left a powerful legacy . and , though they have been handling their own business for decades , France still has a duty of friendship that forbids it to forget and requires it to adopt a certain mode of conduct .
Côte d ’ Ivoire enjoys large agricultural wealth ( along with gold , diamonds , and iron ) ; Tunisia possesses large phosphate deposits ;
the French historian and sociologist Emmanuel Todd has argued that , everywhere in the world , economic takeoff usually occurs 60-70 years after 50 % of the population achieves literacy . moreover , the higher the average age of marriage for women , the faster literacy spreads .
northern Germany and southern Scandinavia were the first regions to experience mass literacy , which was followed by faster economic development a few decades later . these are places where women ’ s average age at marriage has been around 23 for some time .
Tunisia , Egypt , and Libya are three clear cases of massive popular anger against economic underdevelopment and the dictatorships that were justifiably blamed for it . the major difference between the three is that in Tunisia and Egypt , economic development had gone far enough to give rise to a small trading and salaried middle class , which initiated the rebellions and whose members were sufficient in number to succeed – at least in deposing the dictators .
the forces of resistance are too limited , while the military – a key tool of social advancement for the poor – remains in the hands of the dictatorship . the rebellion could not succeed by itself ; from the start , terrible and bloody repression was to be expected .
Côte d ’ Ivoire looks nothing like North Africa : its troubles are purely local , ethnic , and religious . the Republic ’ s first president , Félix Houphouet-Boigny , was elected at independence in 1960 and remained in office until he died in 1993 – always careful to construct governments with representatives from all the tribes , and with a balance between southern Catholics and northern Muslims .
Bédié founded his power on the country ’ s Catholics and his government on tribal membership . and he invented a legitimizing concept of Ivorian identity ( Ivoirité ) , which was largely meant to disqualify northern Muslims as foreigners , because their tribes extended into Mali and Burkina Faso .
this policy ignited a latent conflict , with a military coup in 1999 putting General Robert Gueï in power . but Gueï lasted only three years , with his assassination in 2002 setting the country ’ s conflicting sides on a path to civil war .
in this tense climate , the northern candidate , Alassane Ouattara , a Muslim and former senior official at the International Monetary Fund , was denied the right to run in the 2005 presidential election . the winner , the southerner Laurent Gbagbo , then refused to concede his defeat by Ouattara in 2010 , leading to violent conflict and fear of a long and potentially genocidal civil war .
in both cases , the question in Paris and other capitals was whether to intervene . and in both cases , France had an obvious interest in not intervening , in order to erase its colonial past ( more so in Côte d ’ Ivoire than in Libya , where Italy had been the European colonizer ) .
in Libya , Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi ’ s wanton violence brought the situation firmly under the purview of the United Nations Security Council and the UN ’ s recently proclaimed “ responsibility to protect ” civilians threatened by their own governments . Libyan civilians are now under the protection of international law .
once the decision to intervene was taken , France , with the largest armed forces in the Mediterranean , alas became the most visible of the intervening countries – with few others capable of joining it , the United Kingdom , and the United States . unfortunately , international solidarity for the armed protection of endangered populations does not yet really exist .
the danger is that in much of Africa , former imperialists are suspected of being imperialists still , which could make the development of international law appear to be a mere power play . this is even clearer in Côte d ’ Ivoire : it is the UN that explicitly demanded that France , the only foreign presence , implement the resolution that ratified Ouattara as the elected president and Gbagbo as the usurper .
today ’ s real problems are vastly different from when colonial empires held sway , and they need to be dealt with in a non-imperialist fashion . so what is really needed nowadays is for the world public to become convinced of the need for an effective international watchdog for peace and human rights .
the Return of the King in Nepal
every time we in Nepal think things can ’ t get worse , they do .
in 2001 , as our Maoist insurgency intensified and casualties soared , almost the entire royal family – including King Birendra – were massacred by one of Nepal ’ s princes . the next year , parliament was dissolved and local elected bodies were disbanded .
since February 1 , the Nepali media have been subjected to absolute censorship . nothing that goes against the “ letter and spirit ” of the king ’ s dismissal of his government is allowed to be printed and broadcast , and “ action will be taken against anyone violating the notice . ”
sometimes , they change headlines that they think are critical of the royal move . Nepal ’ s vibrant FM radio stations – once models for decentralized public-service broadcasting and community radio – have been prohibited from broadcasting current affairs .
the BBC ’ s Nepalese service , which used to be relayed through a network of 12 FM stations all over the country , has been stopped . all Indian news channels have been dropped from cable networks .
newspapers and magazines are blandly reproducing official pronouncements and reports from the state-run news agency . some have taken the risk of resorting to metaphors and allegory , while others poke fun at the whole thing by writing editorials on ballet or bee-keeping .
the freedoms that they were so accustomed to , and maybe even took for granted , have now been snatched away . but , for older journalists like me , there is a strong sense of déjà vu — the controls hark back to the times of the partyless absolute monarchy that existed here before 1990 , when self-censorship was the order of the day .
back then , irrational news decisions , sycophancy , and propaganda were passed off as journalism . in those days , editors , reporters , and columnists played a cat-and-mouse game with the authorities , resorting to satire , humor , or metaphor .
but punishment could be harsh . many journalists spent time behind bars , and there was a price to be paid when the morning newspapers contained even accidental typos , such as occurred when a headline concerning a royal birthday read “ suspicious ” instead of “ auspicious . ”
old jokes from the pre-1990 days have returned , like this one : a man was walking down a Kathmandu street , shouting , “ Down with dictatorship in Pakistan . ” A policeman grabbed him and took him in .
to be sure , many Nepalis have welcomed King Gyanendra ’ s move this week . much of the public is disenchanted by the instability caused by fractious and corrupt parliamentary leaders and by the Maoist insurgency , which has cost 12,000 lives in nine years .
many expect the king to pull a rabbit out of his hat , to restore peace and start raising the living standards of Nepal ’ s 25 million people , most of whom live below the poverty line . in his speech on February 1 , King Gyanendra said the Nepali people would have to temporarily give up democracy in order to save democracy , and many Nepalese will go along with that , at least for a while .
perhaps King Gyanendra does have something up his sleeves . in the long run , however , the answer to Maoist totalitarianism is greater and more inclusive democracy , a vibrant free press , and civil liberties .
the Return of the Radicals in Iran
Twenty-six years after the Islamic Revolution , just when the West had expected Iran to settle down and become more pragmatic , the regime of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad seems to have lurched back toward radicalism . by looking at earlier revolutions , we can perhaps come to understand what is happening in Iran , for recent events there have clear historical precedents .
this is because the initial quiet period is often marked by corruption and a retreat from revolutionary goals , leading idealists to feel that the revolution is losing its way . believing that stronger pursuit of revolutionary ideals is the only way to strengthen their country , these idealists seek to inspire a “ return of the radicals , ” triggering sharp conflict with their more pragmatic co-revolutionaries .
the Mexican Revolution of 1910 began with a challenge to the dictator Porfirio Díaz that ignited peasant uprisings and worker revolts . the revolution ’ s radical phase seemed to end in 1920 when General Alvaro Obregón seized power ; he limited land reforms and sought reconciliation with the United States .
then , in 1934 , resentment against growing corruption led Calles to choose an “ honest idealist ” to become president , a young man who had fought for him early in the revolution , who he thought he could control but who would help the government regain popularity . that “ honest revolutionary , ” Lázaro Cárdenas , toured the country , building his popular support , and then turned on Calles , expelling him from Mexico .
in 1938 – twenty-eight years after the revolution began – Cárdenas provoked a major confrontation with the US and Britain by expropriating their oil companies and nationalizing Mexico ’ s petroleum . only in the 1940 ’ s , after Cárdenas left power , did Mexico turn to a more conservative political path .
similarly , China ’ s Communist Revolution began with a decade of attacks on the middle and professional classes and a reshaping of the countryside , culminating in the Great Leap Forward of 1958-59 . but that disastrous campaign weakened Mao ’ s influence ; by the early 1960 ’ s he seemed to be relegated to the sidelines while pragmatists like Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping grew stronger .
yet Mao worried that his revolution was going off track , and in the mid-1960 ’ s he launched an effort to regain control of the Party by educating a new generation of radical youth . these “ Red Guards ” launched the Cultural Revolution in 1966-68 , targeting the more conservative elements within the Communist Party .
in the early 1970 ’ s , moderates gained by engineering a rapprochement with the US , capped by Nixon ’ s famous visit to China in 1972 . Deng was rehabilitated the following year , and in the late 1970 ’ s , after Mao ’ s death , Deng ’ s pragmatists seized control of the regime .
these pit the “ honest radicals ” - led by Ahmadinejad and supported by younger , second-generation revolutionaries known as the Abadgaran , or Developers , who are strong in the Iranian parliament , the Majlis- against the more corrupt and pragmatic mullahs who head the Party , led by Expediency Council Chairman and former President Hashemi Rafsanjani . Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei is left in the middle , perhaps increasingly isolated and without strong popular support .
how should the US and European leaders respond ? historically , phases of resurgent radicalism have lasted 5-10 years , marked by greater aggressiveness against internal and external enemies .
this bodes ill for improved relations with Iran in the short run , and makes it imperative that Western powers unite to make it unambiguously clear that any use of nuclear weapons or materials by Iran or terror groups aligned with Iran will result in an immediate and devastating response . ( China developed its nuclear weapons just before its Cultural Revolution , mainly to deter the Soviet Union , but never used them ) .
it also seems advisable to offer positive incentives – including US recognition and an end to sanctions – that could help empower pragmatists in their intra-Party struggle , much as Nixon ’ s overtures to China helped blunt China ’ s radicalism and strengthened the hand of pragmatists in the Communist Party .
Nixon did not demand that China ’ s leaders abandon communism or that Mexico become a competitive democracy , only that they act responsibly and learn to do business with the US . five decades after its revolution , China is still not a democracy , and Mexico is only just becoming one nine decades after its revolution .
the Return of the Siloviki
Stockholm – Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin recently announced that Russia , Belarus , and Kazakhstan have abandoned their separate talks to join the World Trade Organization . instead , they would seek to enter the world trade body as a single customs union .
two days earlier , United States Trade Representative Ron Kirk and European Union Trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton had completed successful talks on Russia ’ s accession to the WTO with Putin ’ s first deputy , Igor Shuvalov , Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin , and Minister of Economy and Development Elvira Nabiullina . as late as June 3 , Putin had declared himself sure of Russia ’ s “ swift joining of the WTO . ”
the leaders of Belarus or Kazakhstan seemed equally surprised by Putin ’ s statement , especially as Russia had just prohibited almost all imports of dairy products from Belarus in a protectionist ploy . after 16 years of negotiations , Russia appeared poised to join the WTO within a couple of months .
first , Ukraine demands a bilateral protocol on market access , which would force Russia to abolish roughly 100 trade sanctions , primarily in agriculture . the second obstacle is border controls with Georgia , a mainly political issue : whether Abkhazia and South Ossetia are independent , as Russia maintains , or are part Georgia , as the rest of the world believes .
no countries have ever entered the WTO collectively , nor is this legally possible says WTO head Pascal Lamy . moreover , while the customs union was proclaimed in 1995 , the earliest it can be formed is in July 2011 , which is unlikely .
even so , one-fifth of Russia ’ s exports comprise metals and chemicals that are sensitive to anti-dumping measures . a series of World Bank and Russian studies have estimated that Russia can gain 0.5-1.0 percentage points in economic growth for half a decade if it joins the WTO .
before Putin resigned as president in May 2008 , he presented his “ Russia 2020 ” program . its heart was an “ innovation strategy ” based on more market reforms and investment in human capital , leading to annual growth of 6-7 % .
but Putin and his siloviki ( political allies whose power base is in the security apparatus ) seem to prefer an “ inertia strategy , ” the worst of the Russia 2020 scenarios . this strategy amounts to state capitalism , living on Russia ’ s energy wealth , and doing nothing to curtail Russia ’ s massive red tape and corruption .
by reversing course on the WTO , Putin has again shown himself to be Russia ’ s master . he did the same thing last summer by lashing out against a successful mining and metallurgical company , Mechel , and provoking the war in Georgia .
rather than shielding Russia ’ s private enterprises , he engineered a domestic liquidity freeze , which led to a sharp drop in GDP of 9.5 % in the first quarter of 2009 , despite Russia ’ s huge foreign reserves . the pragmatic technocrats took over , but the subsequent doubling of oil prices signals that the danger for Russia ’ s economy is over for now , so the siloviki are resuming command .
the prominent Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer insists that their prime aim is to finish off Georgia and its president , Mikheil Saakashvili , who remains in power and defiant . Georgia has received no military support and is virtually undefended .
during the latter part of this maneuver , July 6-8 , US President Barack Obama is supposed to meet President Medvedev in Moscow . Medvedev obviously hopes to reach out and improve Russia ’ s and his own standing in the world .
the US also wants progress on the territorial integrity of former Soviet states , such as Georgia , but that , too , is unlikely . Putin or his collaborators seem to be setting up Medvedev for a failure , suggesting that their jealousy of Medvedev ’ s limited power is greater than their interest in defending Russia ’ s national interests .
yet there is still hope that Putin encounters a sufficiently negative reaction that he changes his stance on WTO accession . after all , he suspended Russia ’ s WTO accession talks after the August 2008 war in Georgia , only to allow them to restart this spring .
the Return of the Stiff Upper Lip
the British media have been described as “ feral ” ( a word used by Tony Blair , among others ) . the questions asked of politicians by journalists are often so aggressive or implicitly insulting that one wonders why their recipients don ’ t walk out of interviews in a huff , or wither on the spot from humiliation .
for one thing , there is the new coalition government – a rarity unseen since the end of World War II . then , there are the reactions to the new government , which have been marked by a temperateness of tone that is highly unusual – and all the more surprising , given that David Cameron , the new prime minister , has not exactly been the bearer of good news .
Cameron ’ s central proposition is that Britain is in a state of “ crisis , ” and that getting through it will require fortitude and patience . in a major speech , he warned that there is “ pain ” ahead , and that it will be felt by everyone , as severe spending cuts will be required to bring down Britain ’ s massive fiscal deficit .
and , of course , there have been demurrals and criticisms . but , aside from former Labour ministers , protesting bitterly at being blamed for the state of the economy , the response has been remarkably civil and thoughtful .
perhaps an alliance between Conservatives and Liberals – the two parties ostensibly farthest apart in their views – confounded everyone out of their certainties . this in itself may be no bad thing .
for one thing , the coalition exposes an undercurrent in British political life that has coexisted – almost furtively – with heated rhetoric : convergence among the main parties towards a kind of centrist synthesis on most of the big issues .
the policies and positions articulated by the new government suggest not so much the once vaunted Third Way ( a slogan for the age of prosperity ) as a carefully calibrated Middle Way . it is clear , for example , that the sacred cows of public services and social benefits – among the most extensive in the world – will not remain untouched .
in addition , Cameron is proposing other reforms , such as requiring people , after several years ’ unemployment , to accept a job offer , even if it is not the applicant ’ s preference . this may help break the demoralizing cycle of unemployment and alienation .
these come , however , after a vast influx of legal and illegal immigrants . but no one is suggesting that Britain should become a mono-cultural country again .
at the other end of the economic spectrum , banking practices will – one hopes – be better regulated , following a prolonged period of stunning financial irresponsibility . clearly , however , nationalization , or a state-managed economy , is not in the cards .
instead , what the coalition seems to be proposing is a sort of correction , a retrenchment from various excesses and dysfunctions to something more restrained and disciplined . and it seems that this agenda has captured a deep , if mostly unspoken vein of popular feeling – a consensus that something has been amiss in “ broken Britain , ” and that something needs to be done about it .
the tone of stern warning has recently been adopted by other European leaders . but the coalition has one thing going for it : the Brits still love a crisis – and being told that they are in the middle of one has played very well .
politics abhors equilibrium as much as nature abhors a vacuum ; and undoubtedly , tensions within the coalition , as well as outside it , will surface . still , possibly the British mood portends a wider change of climate for Western liberal democracies , and the onset of a new , less indulgent era .
for now , the British upper lip seems to have regained some of its stiffness . one hopes that this will last long enough for British society to regain its stability and its much-needed vigor .
the Revolt of the Debtors
Brussels – Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou ’ s call to hold a referendum on the rescue package agreed at the eurozone summit in late October has profound implications for European governance , despite the fact that the referendum will not now go ahead . it may also determine the future of the euro . &amp; # 160 ;
Papandreou had to reverse course quickly in response to both internal and external pressure , &amp; # 160 ; but the option that he put on the table will not go away whatever the fate of the present Greek government . as long as the Greek people have to be asked to accept one austerity package after another , they might wonder when they will have a direct say on this matter .
less than one week before Papandreou dropped his bombshell , eurozone leaders had spoken unequivocally : “ The introduction of the European Semester has fundamentally changed the way our fiscal and economic policies are coordinated at European level , with co-ordination at EU level now taking place before national decisions are taken . ” Simply put , pan-eurozone financial governance had supposedly won the day .
despite that , it was taken without any coordination with other eurozone leaders . moreover , if Greece ’ s voters had rejected the deal that has just been proposed to them , the outcome might have foreclosed any further coordination on the country ’ s debt problems with the European Union .
so , only days after the eurozone ’ s heads of state and government congratulated themselves on their summit success , the concept of coordination was shown to be meaningless for the one country where coordination matters most . Papandreou ’ s move also exposes the fatal flaw of grand plans for a political or fiscal union to support the euro : the “ people , ” not governments , remain the real sovereign .
the EU remains a collection of sovereign states , and it therefore cannot send an army or a police force to enforce its pacts or collect debt . any country can leave the EU – and , of course , the eurozone – when the burden of its obligations becomes too onerous .
this also implies that Eurobonds will never constitute the silver bullet that some had hoped would solve Europe ’ s sovereign-debt crisis . as long as member states remain fully sovereign , investors cannot be assured that if the eurozone breaks up , some states will not simply refuse to pay – or will not refuse to pay for the others .
the broader message of the Greek move is that “ coordination ” has so far been a code word for almost total control by creditors ( sometimes together with the ECB ) . the attempt to impose a benevolent creditors ’ dictatorship is now being met by a debtors ’ revolt .
nobody can know at this point whether Portugal or Italy might be the next stops on this road of resistance . the result , however , is quite predictable : soaring risk premia throughout the periphery .
Papandreou ’ s decision to call a referendum in Greece could thus have marked the beginning of the endgame for the euro . at this point , the common currency can be saved only if systemically important countries – namely , Italy and Spain – take concerted action to demonstrate that they are different from Greece .
the Revolt of the Meritocrats
Paris – The bailout of the financial system was a bizarre moment in economic history , for it benefited those who benefited most from the markets ’ irrational exuberance – the bosses of financial firms . before the crisis hit , however , redistribution of wealth ( and the tax and social security payments that make it possible ) was considered the biggest obstacle to economic efficiency .
the paradox is that a part of this evolution may be attributable to two positive factors : the slow work of democracy , which liberates individuals but at the same time leaves them more isolated ; and the development of a welfare system that shares risks and makes individuals more autonomous . with this isolation and autonomy , people increasingly tend to believe , for better or for worse , that they alone are responsible for their own fate .
an individual is free and autonomous only because of the collective decisions taken after democratic debate , notably those decisions that guarantee each person access to public goods such as education , health care , etc . some sense of social solidarity may remain , but it is so abstract that those for whom the wheel of fortune has spun so favorably feel little debt .
when merit is measured by money , there is no ethical limit to the size of an individual ’ s paycheck . if I earn ten , a hundred , or a thousand times more than you , it is because I deserve ten , a hundred , or a thousand times more than you .
the central place where this self- ( over ) evaluation meets the fewest obstacles is the financial market . money there is an abstraction – “ the abstraction of abstractions , ” as Hegel put it – which helps explain why salaries are no longer rooted in reality .
of course , when the crisis hit , financial institutions were the first to argue that autonomy was unrealistic , and that we are all interdependent . after all , why else should taxpayers agree to rescue them ?
so yesterday ’ s ( pre-crisis ) world is being resurrected . dismissing the risks that taxpayers incurred , financial institutions used the bailout to restore profitability and are now reverting to their old habits , which had worked so well for them and so badly for others .
if they were already too big to fail , what should we now say when banks are even bigger ? their market power has increased , yet they know they incur no risk , owing to the aggravated systemic impact of their potential bankruptcy .
moreover , they face an economy starved of credit , in which the crisis endangered many companies whose bankruptcy would have no systemic effect . working in so uncompetitive a market is a real stroke of luck .
the free-market doctrine , which has become almost a religion , reinforced this belief : markets are efficient , and if they pay me so much ( a potentially mind-boggling amount , as seen in recent cases ) , it is because my own efficiency warrants it . I also participate indirectly and abstractly in forging the common good , by creating value through my work , and I am rewarded for it .
no mathematician can remember so unprecedented and spectacular a result : parallel lines intersecting , with autonomy becoming ( for the brief moment of the bailout at least ) interdependence . for the connections between the economy and the world of finance are so strong and the interdependency between the so-called parallel universes so tight that there was no choice .
eyes are opened ; the illusion of arbitrage between efficiency and solidarity fades . the crisis reminds us what each person owes to others , highlighting an ethical truth that we were quick to forget : the rich benefit more than the poor from their cooperation with other members of society .
the first is that we all owe at least some of our success to others , given the public goods that society provides . this calls for more modesty and restraint in determining the highest salaries , not for moral reasons but for the sustainability of the system .
the second conclusion is that the most privileged classes , which have benefited the most from the solidarity of others , notably the poor , can no longer deny the latter ’ s contributions . but don ’ t hold your breath waiting for them to agree .
the Revolutionary Ethics of Embryo Research
in June , the prestigious journal Science published an article by the South Korean scientist Woo-Suk Hwang and an international team of co-authors describing how they had developed what were , in effect , “ made to order ” lines of human stem cells cloned from an adult . although the scientific validity of their research is now the subject of several separate investigations , it is no less important to examine its ethical implications .
at the beginning of December , Hwang disclosed that some of the eggs came from two women working in his lab , and that other “ donors ” had been paid for their eggs – a breach of ethical guidelines that had nothing to do with the accuracy of the science . but then Hwang ’ s collaborators began questioning the validity of the experiment itself , and Hwang notified Science that he wished to withdraw the paper .
we will not know how close we are to the production of individually tailored stem-cell lines until the scientific investigations into Hwang ’ s research are completed . nevertheless , few researchers doubt that what Hwang and his colleagues claimed to do is , in principle , achievable .
but the ethical significance of such research goes far beyond the undoubted importance of saving critically ill patients . proving the possibility of cloning from the nucleus of an ordinary human cell would transform the debate about the value of potential human life , for we would find that “ potential human life ” was all around us , in every cell of our bodies .
for example , when President George W. Bush announced in 2001 that the United States would not fund research into new stem-cell lines that are created from human embryos , he offered the following reason : “ Like a snowflake , each of these embryos is unique , with the unique genetic potential of an individual human being . ”
but it is precisely this reasoning that is threatened by what Hwang and his team claimed to have achieved . if it is the uniqueness of human embryos that makes it wrong to destroy them , then there is no compelling reason not to take one cell from an embryo and destroy the remainder of it to obtain stem cells , for the embryo ’ s “ unique genetic potential ” would be preserved .
this possibility highlights the weakness of the argument that abortion , too , is wrong because it destroys a genetically unique human being . by this reasoning , a woman who finds herself pregnant at an inconvenient time could have an abortion , as long as she preserves a single cell from the fetus to ensure that its unique genetic potential is preserved .
if , at a later date , the woman wants to have a child , why should she use the DNA of her earlier , aborted fetus rather than conceiving another fetus in the usual way ? each fetus – the one she aborts and the one she later conceives through sexual intercourse – has its own “ unique ” DNA .
perhaps the assumption is that , as opponents of abortion sometimes say , the aborted fetus had the genetic potential to become a Beethoven or an Einstein . but , for all we know , it is the next fetus that the woman will conceive , not the one she aborted , that will turn out to be the Beethoven or Einstein .
once we abandon arguments based on potential , the claim that it is wrong to kill embryos and fetuses must be based on the nature of those entities themselves – that they are actual human beings who already possess the characteristics that make killing wrong .
but , because fetuses , at least at the stage of development when most abortions are performed , have yet to develop any kind of consciousness , it seems reasonable to regard ending their lives as much less serious than killing a normal human being . if so , then this is all the more true of embryos .
the Revolution Reborn
Mexico CITY – In El Salvador , for the first time ever in Latin America , a former political-military organization that tried to gain power through the barrel of a gun has achieved its aims through the ballot box . although the Sandinista Front in Nicaragua did win a semi-legitimate election in 1984 , it had reached power five years earlier by overthrowing the Somoza dictatorship .
El Salvador ’ s Farabundo Martí Liberation Front ( FMLN ) was created in 1980 , through the fusion of five guerrilla groups supported by Cuba and Nicaragua . the FMLN nominated a presentable and attractive candidate , Mauricio Funes , for last Sunday ’ s presidential election , and , despite seeing a 10-point lead whittled down to barely two points by election night , squeaked out an uncontested victory .
the conservative ARENA party , which has governed El Salvador since the country ’ s 10-year civil war ended in 1992 , did everything possible to prevent an FMLN victory , resorted , once again , to every red-baiting trick in the book . according to ARENA ’ s relentlessly negative campaign , a triumph for the left would bring communism , Hugo Chávez , and the Castro brothers to San Salvador .
there is obviously a lesson here to be learned by other left-wing political movements and guerrilla groups in Latin America . the Socialist Party in Chile , the Workers Party in Brazil , the Broad Front in Uruguay , even Chávez in Venezuela and the PRD and FSLN in Mexico and Nicaragua , respectively , have shown that , after years of waiting , the left can win elections in Latin America .
the difference between these victorious leftists and El Salvador ’ s FMLN will be revealed when the FMLN ’ s old characteristics as an armed movement are challenged by the daily facts of governance . for , while Funes is no old guerrilla hack , his vice president , Salvador Sanchez Ceren , and almost the entire FMLN leadership are unreformed Castroist guerrilla leaders and cadres .
a second worrying factor is the FMLN ’ s links to Cuba and Venezuela . as recently as a year ago , anyone who visited FMLN headquarters in San Salvador to interview , for example , Ceren , its Secretary General , would be struck by the overwhelming presence of Chávez : red shirts , red berets , pictures of the Venezuelan caudillo , quotations from his teachings and musings .
Chávez helped the FMLN by giving free or cheap oil to its mayors in many parts of the country , and probably ( though it has not been proven ) by channeling funds , if only in small quantities , to the party ’ s electoral coffers . the Cuban presence also remains strong , although the recent political purges initiated by Raúl Castro make it difficult to know who exactly is working for whom .
Cuban and Venezuelan involvement in political parties in Mexico or Brazil , for example , is undisputable , but not necessarily very relevant . these are large countries with huge economies , where conspiring and doling out small perks and favors is not very effective .
a third factor that weighs in the balance in analyzing what sort of government the FMLN may deliver is the economic crisis that is battering Latin America . for the moment , it is impossible to ascertain whether the recession will provoke a radicalization of the left in the region , which Chávez seems to be promoting , or induce moderation through resignation – that is , a postponement of revolutionary goals owing to inauspicious economic conditions .
Nicaragua ’ s Ortega was always part of that orbit , as are people close to Alvaro Colóm in Guatemala . if too we add El Salvador to this list , only Costa Rica and Panama to the south remain out of the loop , leaving Mexico to the north increasingly exposed .
the Right Populism for Poland
Poland ’ s parliamentary and presidential elections this month saw the death of a left-leaning postcommunist party that mostly dominated the country since 1995 . but the demise of the left does not mean that the right has a coherent economic program .
if PiS ’ s populist slogans become policy , government spending is likely to expand , which will exacerbate Poland ’ s already weak fiscal position and consequently trigger inflationary expectations . worse , boosting social spending will contribute little to resolving the country ’ s staggering 17.5 % rate of unemployment – most of it structural – while any hope of quick euro adoption will be dashed .
what Poland needs most is fiscal discipline and market-oriented reforms , including relaxation of the rigid labor laws that are inhibiting job creation . after all , over the past two decades , the enduring goals of dismantling communism and central planning , as well as joining the European Union , have served as important driving forces of reform .
such a strategic goal would provide justification for prudent fiscal and monetary policies , and , given Poles ’ desire to consider themselves full Europeans , it would boost political support for such policies . only such support can bring the government budget deficit , expected to reach 4.4 % of GDP in 2005 , down to the EU ’ s benchmark of less than 3 % of GDP within the next two years .
it will reinforce convergence expectations among financial market participants , which will translate into lower risk premia for investors . lower risk also will bring inflation expectations down and reduce interest rates , which will in turn speed up the compression of Polish government bond yields to comparable EU levels , increasing financial stability .
while the current yield on 10-year Polish government bonds of 4.7 % appears to be at the edge of meeting the Maastricht long-term interest-rate benchmark , sustainability will depend on the fiscal policy outlook and on the overall credit risk . more stable financial markets and a less volatile exchange rate relative to the euro will bring many advantages .
so it is imperative that the new government prepares – in cooperation with the National Bank of Poland ( NBP ) – a comprehensive program to steer the course of fiscal and monetary policy toward the goal of euro membership .
by developing and disclose to the public a compelling rationale for what will determine the exchange rate when the time comes , the financial markets would then be able to forecast the future reference exchange rate more precisely . this would reduce the potential for speculative currency arbitrage and mitigate exchange-rate risk in the run-up to euro adoption , which would contribute to lower market interest rates , as their level always incorporates the prevalent exchange-rate risk .
these include legal impediments to labor mobility , reform of a complex tax system beset by excessive rates and porous loopholes , and substandard road infrastructure . each should be regarded as an urgent matter by the new government , and each , if handled adroitly , could be “ sold ” to the public as the type of popular reform that people have been demanding .
Poland ’ s new government faces several serious challenges , not the least of which will be to reconcile its liberal and populist tendencies . only if populism is put at the service of liberal reform will the government achieve lasting benefits .
the Right Priorities for the G8
in the run-up to the G8 meeting in Scotland on July 6-8 , British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called on the international community to set the right global priorities , which he has unequivocally stated should be Africa and global warming . Blair is right in challenging us to set priorities .
they must work with bureaucracies , which are naturally disinclined to have their efforts prioritized , lest they end up as anything less than number one . whenever we prioritize , we not only say where we should do more ( which is good ) but also where we should not increase our efforts ( which is regarded as cynical ) .
refusing to prioritize , dealing mainly with the most publicized problems , is wrong . imagine doctors at a perpetually overrun hospital refusing to perform triage on casualties , merely attending patients as they arrived and fast-tracking those whose families made the most fuss .
this question was addressed in a groundbreaking project involving a long list of the world ’ s top economists at the Copenhagen Consensus last year . a “ dream team ” of eight economists , including three Nobel Laureates , confronted the basic question : if the world had , say , an extra $ 50 billion to do good , where could that money best be spent ?
a comprehensive program would cost $ 27 billion , but the potential social benefits would be immense : avoidance of more than 28 million new cases of HIV / AIDS by 2010 . this makes it the best investment the world could make , reaping social benefits that outweigh the costs by 40 to 1 .
similarly , providing micronutrients missing from more than half the world ’ s diet would reduce diseases caused by deficiencies of iron , zinc , iodine , and Vitamin A with an exceptionally high ratio of benefits to cost . if we could only find the political will , establishing free trade could be achieved at a very low cost , with benefits of up to $ 2.4 trillion a year .
the list goes on to focus on agricultural technologies to tackle food production and hunger , as well as technologies to boost the supply of clean drinking water and improve sanitation . given that these problems are most acute in Africa , Blair ’ s priorities have some merit .
the experts rated responses to climate change extremely low on the “ to do ” list . in fact , the panel called these ventures – including the Kyoto Protocol – “ bad projects ” because they cost more than the good they do .
but the Kyoto rules will make an almost imperceptible difference ( postponing temperature increases from 2100 to 2106 ) at a substantial cost ( about $ 150 billion per year ) . given scarce resources , we must ask ourselves : do we want to do a lot of good now , or a little good much later ?
they cannot take preventive measures . breaking the cycle of poverty by addressing the most pressing issues of disease , hunger , and polluted water will not only do obvious good , but also make people less vulnerable .
the urgent problem of the poor majority of this world is not climate change . their problems are more basic : not dying from easily preventable diseases ; not being malnourished from lack of simple micronutrients ; not being prevented from exploiting opportunities in the global economy by lack of free trade .
we can prevent millions from dying from malnutrition simply by distributing vitamin supplements . these are not space-age technologies , but staple goods that the world needs .
doing the best things first would be a great investment in the planet ’ s future . if we are serious about solving the world ’ s most serious challenges , we owe it to ourselves to set the right priorities .
anchoring the Arab Awakening
Egypt is running low on cash – before recent rescue loans , currency reserves covered less than three months of imports – and Egyptians are hoarding fuel and foodstuffs in anticipation of future shortages . more frequent and longer-lasting power outages foretell worse to come in an economy already struggling with mass unemployment , widespread exclusion , and deep pockets of poverty .
short-term macroeconomic stability is the immediate priority in Egypt and the other Arab Awakening countries . in the medium term , however , the viability of the current order is at stake – and not only in these countries , but across the rest of North Africa and the Middle East .
with so much at stake , Majid Jafar of UAE-based Crescent Petroleum was right to worry at the recent World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa at the Dead Sea . his proposal of an Arab Stabilization Plan , inspired by the post-1945 Marshall Plan in Western Europe , is laudable .
the Marshall Plan was a macroeconomic strategy involving massive capital transfers to help reconstruct the war-ravaged industrial capacity and infrastructure of economies with well-developed institutions . but what the Arab region needs are micro-oriented , project-based , and governance-heavy investments conditioned on deep reform of a business environment that is generally considered among the worst in the world .
in a joint report on the competitiveness of the Arab countries , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) and the World Economic Forum call for urgent institutional reform to support private-sector growth . excessive red tape and ineffective enforcement of competition policy and governance rules are hampering entrepreneurship throughout the region .
perhaps surprisingly , there is widespread consensus in the Arab Awakening countries that the private sector is central to sustained job creation and growth . we saw this recently when the EBRD , together with the British-based organization Forward Thinking , conducted a closed-door workshop for 27 leading representatives of parties from across the political spectrum in the region .
the parties on the right largely embrace free-market thinking , while Egypt ’ s Muslim Brotherhood and its kindred parties in Libya and Tunisia are deeply sceptical of the state , which they view as bloated , inept , and ultimately corrupt . moreover , the existing banks have failed to serve these parties ’ small-business and farming constituencies .
but the region can look to the successful transition in Central Europe and the powerful anchor for reforms provided by these countries ’ accession to the European Union . countries like Hungary and Poland can hardly be accused of having a hidden agenda when they share their development experience .
the good news is that the economies of the Arab Awakening countries do not suffer from the deep distortions that characterized post-communist Europe . many of the early reforms have already been implemented , and reasonably sophisticated banking systems are in place .
as a result , while political uncertainty will take its toll on economic growth , the Arab Awakening countries should not have to face a transitional recession , as post-communist Europe did in the 1990 ’ s . on the other hand , they are unlikely to benefit from the subsequent robust growth that most European transition countries experienced .
most critically , it must be a plan owned by the countries themselves and based on an approach that recognizes the critical roles of an enabling state and a catalytic financial sector . the ongoing socio-political transition , underpinned by widespread public recognition of the need for change , provides a historic opportunity to embark on growth-enhancing reforms .
the Right to Die
Welby , who suffered from muscular dystrophy and was paralyzed , had battled unsuccessfully in the Italian courts for the right to die . after Riccio gave him a sedative and switched off the respirator , Welby said “ thank you ” three times to his wife , his friends , and his doctor .
Welby ’ s request to die was widely publicized in Italy , where it led to heated debate . at the time of writing , it is unclear whether Riccio will be charged with any offense .
one is whether a person has a right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment . the other is whether voluntary euthanasia is ethically defensible .
a patient ’ s informed consent should be a prerequisite for all medical treatment , as long as the patient is a competent adult in a position to make a decision . forcing medical treatment on a competent adult patient who does not want it is tantamount to assault .
that document states that to refuse a burdensome medical treatment “ is not the equivalent of suicide . ” On the contrary , such a refusal “ should be considered an acceptance of the human condition , or a wish to avoid the application of a medical procedure disproportionate to the results that can be expected , or a desire not to impose excessive expense on the family or the community . ”
that description applies well to Welby ’ s decision . on this view , Riccio was doing what anyone should have been prepared to do for Welby , who was paralyzed and unable to implement his refusal of a burdensome medical treatment .
defenders of Catholic teaching would answer that in the latter case , the patient intends to end his life , and that is wrong , whereas in the former case , the patient merely intends to avoid the additional burden that treatment brings . death is , of course , a foreseeable consequence of avoiding that burden , but it is a byproduct that is not directly intended .
many countries recognize a legal right to refuse medical treatment . but only in the Netherlands , Belgium , Switzerland , and the American state of Oregon are physicians permitted to assist a patient in ending his or her life by means other than withdrawing life-sustaining medical treatment .
the Netherlands , in particular , has been subjected to a relentless campaign of vilification . critics allege that the legalization of voluntary euthanasia has led to a breakdown of trust in the medical profession and all sorts of other dire consequences .
the Dutch know how voluntary euthanasia is practiced in their country , they know that legal euthanasia has improved , rather than harmed , their medical care , and they want the possibility of assistance in dying , if they should want and need it . isn ’ t that a choice that everyone should have ?
the Right to Equality , Then and Now
London – Following weeks of financial and economic turmoil , public debate has finally turned to the horrific potential human ramifications of the collapse of the global financial system . comparisons and contrasts with the Great Depression of the 1930 ’ s have inevitably become a central part of that discourse – and rightly so .
recession and depression can lead to exclusion and , at worst , persecution of societies ’ most vulnerable groups . that is why the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights was adopted in 1948 , and why we need , more urgently than ever , to establish universal equality for all human beings .
Nations must act now to ensure that everyone – regardless of wealth , ethnicity , sex , or religion – has the same rights , and that these rights are enshrined in laws at the time they are enacted .
this October , 128 leading experts in the fields of human rights and equality from 44 countries launched a landmark attempt to build on the epochal 1948 UN declaration to establish universal human equality . we did so by launching a “ Declaration on Principles of Equality ” – a declaration that builds on its historical precursor to establish , for the first time ever , general legal principles that define equality as a basic human right .
based on a total of 27 principles , the Declaration reflects a moral and professional consensus among human rights and equality experts and is the product of more than a year ’ s work led by the United Kingdom-based Equal Rights Trust . needless to say , reaching a consensus among such a diverse group of people from around the world was not easy .
equality means different things to different people – and at different times . interpretations largely depend on the practical realities of the social , cultural , and political environment in which the principles of equality operate .
all signatories to our new Declaration agreed that incitement to violence that is motivated by race or gender or sexual orientation constitutes a serious violation of the right to equality . some American civil rights lawyers , out of natural deference to the United States Constitution ’ s First Amendment were , however , reluctant to sign up to this principle unless it was qualified by a reference to the threat of “ imminent ” violence .
some participants from the developing countries wanted poverty to be declared a proscribed basis of discrimination , while others argued that poverty is far too vague a concept to be the subject of legal rights and duties . some contended that absolute poverty differs from relative poverty , or asked what responsibility individuals have to raise themselves out of poverty through education and work ?
these participants argued that specific legal duties , such as the right to a minimum wage and the right to vocational training , are more effective than the vague extension of anti-discrimination law to cover poverty as such . the result was a compromise between these two groups .
for all these differences of opinion , we are unanimous in the belief that , if the Principles of Equality are to be effective in our age , they have to go well beyond the negative anti-discrimination model that was adopted in the US and Europe in the second half of the twentieth century . they must , instead , encourage nations positively to promote the principle of equal rights in keeping with current interpretations of international obligation .
in other words , it exists as a separate right , and is not dependent on the violation of some other legal right , such as the right to education . it follows , then , that the right to equality could be violated even where another legal right – to , say , housing or employment – does not exist .
the right to equality would exist in all areas of activity regulated by domestic , international or regional law . it would apply to everyone , regardless of nationality or statelessness , including refugees and asylum seekers , and it would place a positive obligation on states to “ promote and fulfill ” the right to equality .
a new declaration was badly needed when we began work on it one year ago . today , it is crucial if we are to prevent an even greater chasm from dividing the world ’ s haves and have-nots .
the Right Way to Beat Chinese Inflation
as a result , the People ’ s Bank of China has raised interest rates substantially and increased banks ’ reserve requirements . the trick for the Chinese government will be to quell inflation in a way that does not compromise its long-term goal of continued strong economic growth .
China ’ s accelerating inflation reflects a similar climb in its GDP growth rate , from the already high 11 % in 2006 to 11.5 % in 2007 . the proximate cause of price growth since mid-2007 is the appearance of production bottlenecks as domestic demand exceeds supply in an increasing number of sectors , such as power generation , transportation , and intermediate-goods industries .
thus , lowering inflation would require reducing the growth rate ( if not the level ) of these two demand components . but Chinese policymakers should focus more on reducing the trade surplus and less on reducing investment spending – that is , they should emphasize renminbi ( RMB ) appreciation over higher interest rates to cool the economy .
a sizeable reduction in aggregate demand through RMB appreciation is achievable without being imprudent , because the current-account surplus in 2007 was 9.5 % of GDP . investment ( especially in infrastructure in backward areas and social investments ) should not bear the brunt of the expenditure squeeze , because today ’ s investment is also tomorrow ’ s growth in production capacity ; and the production of more goods tomorrow would reduce inflation .
using RMB appreciation as the primary tool to fight inflation implies accepting a temporarily higher unemployment rate now in exchange for a permanently lower unemployment rate in the future . this is because manufactured exports are typically more labor-intensive than investment projects .
policy makers should closely monitor potential changes in the economic conditions in the G-7 . a deep recession in the United States resulting from the sub-prime crisis would significantly lower Chinese exports and cut the prices of oil and other primary commodities .
in short , substantial RMB appreciation would reduce the bilateral US-China trade deficit and China ’ s overall trade surplus significantly , but it would do little to reduce the overall US trade deficit . in the absence of a generalized appreciation of all Asian currencies and unchanged American policies , possibly only a deep recession could reduce the overall US current-account deficit .
the Right Way to Electric Cars
new YORK – Excitement about electric cars abounds nowadays , but consider the number of existing gasoline-powered cars : about 850 million . it would take years of new-car sales to make a dent in that number .
even though many of them are in trouble , it ’ s probably not the best time to start a new car company , either . yet while the market for new cars has slowed dramatically , it could be a good time to start a business replacing gasoline engines with electric ones .
the group ’ s initiative , led by Räsänen , is called eCars - Now ! a small operation in Finland , it is less a company than a role model for companies that the team hopes will spring up worldwide .
borrowing from the open-software movement , Räsänen and his colleagues want to make the idea and the basic designs free , and encourage lots of companies all over the world to implement it locally . some companies will make batteries or electric engines or retrofit kits ; others will retrofit gasoline cars with the new engines – a great job opportunity for unemployed auto workers .
eCars- Now ! hopes to foster an ecosystem of car service workers and parts makers similar to the ecosystem of open-software programmers and generic computer hardware . of course , the parallels end at some point , because batteries and engines aren ’ t quite the equivalent of PCs , but the ethos is much the same .
“ No one had done that before in Finland , ” he recalls . “ We decided that if we could get 500 people to show interest in a converted car , we could demonstrate that the mass conversion scheme would make sense . ”
to be sure , they merely indicated interest ; they did not send money . but the company ’ s Web site continues to attract new prospects , with 1,000 people now registered as likely or certain to buy such a vehicle .
the site also solicited advice on which car to convert . the Toyota Corolla was the first choice – hardly surprising since it is the leading car model in Finland ( with 7 % of the market ) .
just 15 months later , in May of this year , a retrofitted Corolla demo model with an engine from Detroit-based Azure Dynamics was on display at the Electric Vehicle Symposium , a trade show in Stavanger , Norway .
in Italy , inventor Roberto Vezzi had a Smart-EV project along the same lines . he has now joined the eCars – Now ! movement , and his eSmart car will be upgraded with the open-source graphical user interface being developed for the eCorolla in Finland .
other initiatives are springing up in Denmark , Latvia , Spain , and Turkey , says Räsänen . the group is now looking for an initial manufacturer / assembler for the retrofit kits ( as opposed to the engines inside them ) .
produced on an appropriate scale , a kit should cost about $ 20,000 , including distribution costs and a profit margin . it should take about eight hours for two workers in a professional garage to install such a kit , or less than a week for the car-owner himself / herself ( or , as they say , two weeks if the owner ’ s spouse “ helps ” ) .
the real economic benefit , however , is in the cost savings thereafter . to be sure , a lot will depend on the availability of convenient charging stations , but they are starting to appear .
the project is deconstructing the car industry – probably in a more effective way than American government officials are doing in Detroit . in Finland , at least , all you need from the government is a certificate of inspection , which costs about € 100 ( $ 135 ) .
if all goes well , a host of electric car-engine and retrofit kit makers will appear , serving different markets of existing car owners . dealers and mechanics will install the batteries , comprising a new corps of workers devoted ( indirectly ) to cleaning up the environment and adding value to the installed base of cars .
that provides an incentive to retrofitting companies , while competition for customers , rather than for subsidies , will encourage the various providers to be efficient . ( many European governments currently have “ cash-for-clunker ” schemes that buy and destroy old cars ; a cash-for-gas-engines scheme would make more sense by lowering costs and conserving the many car bodies that still work fine . )
it ’ s energy- and environmentally- friendly at a time when concerns about global warming are growing . and it ’ s distributed , at a time when the world is skeptical of leaders ’ promises and people are realizing they have to do things for themselves .
if you want to start an electric engine company , learn how to retrofit a gasoline engine , or simply figure out what you could do with your own car , go to www.ecars-now.org . there may not yet be a ready-made solution for you unless you live in Finland , but that ’ s just the point : you can start a local version .
the Rise and Fall of Meritocracy
such merit is usually understood to be academic achievement , a combination of talent and training . this is measured by academic degrees , which in turn are graded on merit : a , B , C , D , or First , Upper Second , Lower Second , Third .
who would not wish to live in a meritocracy ? it is certainly preferable to a plutocracy , in which wealth determines status , or a gerontocracy , in which age leads one to the top , or even an aristocracy , in which what counts are inherited titles and properties .
so meritocracy seems preferable , at least at first sight . but , on closer inspection , things are not so simple .
most of those in the top reaches of not only the civil service and the judiciary , but also politics , business , and academia used to be graduates of the famous grandes écoles . many then went through the rigorous training to become inspecteurs de finance , senior state officials .
the uneasy relationship of money and politics has given rise to several high-profile scandals in recent years . it is no longer clear that France ’ s highly educated leaders are better able to run the country ’ s affairs more efficiently and more honestly than others .
Japan ’ s meritocratically selected bureaucracy , too , faces much the same public opprobrium . indeed , the bureaucracy itself is often blamed for the country ’ s rigidity and ongoing stagnation .
yet it was a British social scientist ( and Labour Party politician ) , Michael Young , who forty years ago wrote a much debated book entitled The Rise of the Meritocracy . his was not a description of the road to the promised land , but a dystopian vision of almost Orwellian dimensions .
two central questions raised by Young remain topical today . first , if academic achievement is the entry ticket to power and status , what about the rest ?
they are , Young argued , confined , even condemned to lower-level jobs , with no chance to rise to eminence , or even to a comfortable position of responsibility . according to Young , those who have at least some talent will form a “ pioneer corps ” of plumbers and builders and other skilled workers .
the new underclass is the other side of the meritocratic elite . immigrants , in particular , do not enjoy the equality of opportunity that the word “ merit ” suggests .
indeed , nowadays meritocracy seems to be simply another version of the inequality that characterises all societies . it may in fact be a particularly cruel form of inequality , as those who do not succeed cannot argue that they were unlucky or kept down by those in power .
to this must be added another feature that Young described : meritocracy means only that another ruling group closes the gates behind it once it has achieved its status . those who made it on “ merit ” now want to have everything else as well – not just power and money , but also the opportunity to determine who gets in and who stays out .
sooner or later , Young argued , meritocratic elites cease to be open ; they see to it that their children have a better chance than the offspring of the “ pioneer corps ” or “ home help corps . ” Like all elites before them , they become firmly established – and use all available means to keep it that way .
there is a need , however , for a healthy skepticism towards the claims of a meritocracy based on academic achievement alone . such a society is not the answer to all our prayers for decency and fairness , or even for sensible and good decisions .
it is far better to remember that when it comes to leadership , many qualities other than a first-class degree come into play . as far as institutions are concerned , we should not allow any one criterion to determine who gets to the top and who does not .
the Rise of Mid-Level Powers
the security environment since the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the United States has clearly demonstrated the limits of the United Nations , or even the US as the world ’ s sole military superpower , to maintain international security . however , like-minded mid-level powers with similar intentions could complement what the UN or the US lacks , effectively generating sufficient clout to stabilize the global security environment .
all are long time allies of the US . in fact , over recent years these countries have already had many opportunities to demonstrate their ability and willingness to contribute to international security if called for , for they all also share a recognition that global stability directly serves their own national interests .
nevertheless , subtle differences among these countries may influence their bilateral cooperation or coordination with the UN or the US . as a result , they must compliment each other ’ s advantages , characteristics , and interests in order to optimize their role in promoting international security .
in March 2007 , Japan agreed to enter a “ semi-alliance ” with Australia , and issued a “ Joint Communiqué on Japan-Australia Security Cooperation . ” In early June , the two countries ’ defense and foreign ministers held the first regular security meeting ( the so-called “ 2 + 2 meeting ” ) in Tokyo , agreeing to promote defense cooperation in various fields , including international security .
under Japan ’ s last two prime ministers , Japan has steadily been making practical contributions to the stabilization of the international security environment as a way to benefit its national and international interests . Japan is thus helping to create conditions to allow mid-level powers to act jointly and effectively to provide an essential international “ public good . ”
such practical proposals address key global issues , including international terrorism , strengthening of mechanisms for arms control , arms reduction , and non-proliferation , efforts to contain attempts by North Korea and Iran to develop nuclear weapons , encouraging transparency in China ’ s military , restraining Russia ’ s imperial ambitions , and building a global ballistic missile defense network against missiles that could be launched by rogue regimes .
there are many other potential mid-level democratic countries that should take part . various approaches may be available for building a coalition of such powers , including the use of the UN and seeking to influence US foreign policy .
to advance such efforts , it may be necessary for mid-level powers such as Japan , Canada , Australia , and Germany to strengthen ties with other like-minded mid-level countries that possess nuclear weapons and hold permanent seats on the UN Security Council , such as the United Kingdom and France , or with smaller nuclear powers without permanent Security Council seats , such as India .
once such a coalition gains a sure footing , the next step would be to participate actively in the negotiation of major security issues , such as international arms control , arms reduction , and non-proliferation , while encouraging the involvement of China and Russia . the goal should be to build and exercise influence within the international community to the point that the coalition becomes tantamount to a permanent “ sixth ” member of the Security Council .
the New Economy of Fealty
but , despite large-scale fiscal and monetary stimulus , they are not experiencing any dramatic economic rebound . moreover , the pre-crisis trend of rising income and wealth inequality is continuing ( in marked contrast to the post-Great Depression period , in which inequality declined ) .
the explanation of the post-crisis malaise – and people ’ s perception of it – lies in the combination of economic uncertainty and the emergence of radically new forms of social interaction . long-term structural shifts are fundamentally changing the nature of work , and thus of the way that we think of economic exchange .
that proportion subsequently fell sharply , and the same decline could later be seen in industrial employment . since the late twentieth century , most employment growth has come in services , particularly personal services – a pattern that looks like a reversal of a previous historical trend .
in the interwar years , these employees largely disappeared from the lives of all but the ultra-rich . the iconoclastic British historian A. J. P. Taylor quipped that laments about the decline of Britain were really generalized reflections of Oxford academics ’ view of the “ servant problem . ”
by the end of the twentieth century , however , many of these old service occupations were reappearing on a large scale , as dual-career households needed additional “ help . ” The employment of nannies , au pairs , babysitters , and day mothers reflected carefully differentiated approaches to the problem of looking after children .
after child care , there followed hordes of private tutors , test coaches , and university admissions consultants . and , beyond childhood and adolescence , the need for specialized personal support only grew .
dating agencies have developed increasingly complex algorithms to sort out their clients ’ romantic lives . lawyers work out prenuptial contracts , and then the complexities of divorce negotiations .
doctors need experts to deal with insurance forms , negotiate with other doctors and pharmaceutical providers , and manage legal risks . educational specialists fill every conceivable logistical and administrative gap , run sports and arts programs , guarantee diversity , and oversee technology transfer to the private sector .
cautious parents seek agents to select their employees and technology to monitor them as they work . so , to find out about the reputation of service providers , we need still more service providers : ratings and surveys and agents to tell us about agents .
the new service economy extends market relations to areas of life in which , previously , informal assistance and guidance within family units prevailed . to the extent that employment and income in the new services can be easily recorded , this change implies an increase in measurable economic wealth and output , because unpaid household services are ignored in GDP calculations .
experts might thus interpret the macroeconomic consequences as largely positive . but the element of personal dependence is a throwback to the preindustrial world .
the zenith of the old service economy was the court of Louis XIV , where specialist courtiers attended to the Sun King ’ s every need , even the most intimate ( there was a Groom of the King ’ s Close Stool ) . in that pre-modern world , private life was extraordinarily public , whereas the social movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries dramatically expanded the realm of individual privacy and self-definition .
we need advice on every aspect of life , provided in a complex world by people whom we think to be experts in ever-narrower and more specialized fields . we can easily monitor that advice and subject it to statistical testing : are our children doing better on tests ?
we are moving back to the Sun King ’ s world , in which everything personal is known , rumored , or whispered . but now , with electronic surveillance , personal dependence has never been more extreme , more humiliating , and more depressing .
this might explain some of the public dissatisfaction captured in so many surveys , even when economic conditions are not dire .
the Rise of the Beijing Consensus
Brussels – President Barack Obama ’ s first appearances outside North America – in London , Strasbourg , Prague , and Istanbul – galvanized world attention . but what that trip singularly failed to do was paper over a startling fact : the “ Washington Consensus ” about how the global economy should be run is now a thing of the past .
although China is often said to lack “ soft power , ” many of its ideas on economics and governance are coming into ascendance . indeed , in pursuit of national economic stability , the Obama administration is clearly moving towards the kind of government intervention that China has been promoting over the past two decades .
China is clearly pleased to see that the United States is now also placing cool calculation of its national interests at the forefront of its foreign policy . “ In delivering a better life for people on the ground , one should be more concerned with substance than with form , ” Obama stated in an interview just before his inauguration .
as the US backtracks on its liberal standards , it is flirting with what can be called the “ Beijing Consensus , ” which makes economic development a country ’ s paramount goal and prescribes that states should actively steer growth in a way that suits national stability . what matters in this worldview is not the nature of any country ’ s political system , but the extent to which it improves its people ’ s wellbeing .
this diplomatic and economic realism is more than a reversal of the neo-conservative muscle-flexing of the George W. Bush years . it is an attempt by a declining power to use its restrained capabilities in a more economical way .
for example , in times of crisis it is no shame for a government to be mercantilist , but by behaving in this way , the US has lost the moral high ground as a champion of free trade .
over the past two decades , the US and its European allies believed that they could inculcate the rest of the world with their economic and political principles . countries like China became enmeshed in a web of multilateral organizations and subjugated to conditional engagement strategies .
as we move from a unipolar international order to one with multiple regional powers , realism should allow them to vie for influence while keeping the costs as low as possible . the result will be a new concert of powers , tied together by their fixation with national economic growth and the objective of discouraging others from causing instability that risks intervention .
instead of entrusting America with the arduous task of safeguarding international stability on its own , the BRICs ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) will assume a more prominent role in policing their own backyards . Russia can have its Caucasus , and if the generals in Myanmar should go mad , it would become China ’ s and India ’ s problem to sort out .
America has the flexibility , capacity , and leadership to adapt to the new rules for pursuing diplomacy , but Europe simply does not . its strategic relevance , even in the transatlantic partnership , is destined to weaken further .
realism will give the US more maneuverability in the short term , but it will have to sacrifice some of its soft power to achieve this . whether America is able to strengthen its global influence in the future will depend not so much on its moral esteem , but on the extent to which it succeeds in revamping its economy and forging new alliances .
overlapping spheres of influence and frozen conflicts could again cause major conflict . and , if China comes out of the crisis as the big winner and continues to boost its power , zero-sum thinking will soon replace win-win cooperation .
the Rise of the BRICs
the winners of the great globalization push of the 1990 ’ s were small states such as New Zealand , Chile , Dubai , Finland , Ireland , the Baltic Republics , Slovenia , and Slovakia . the East Asian tigers that pushed themselves onto the world economy ’ s center stage were small units , and in some cases – Singapore , Taiwan , or Hong Kong – were not even treated as states .
in the world of pure globalization , small states do best , because they are more flexible and can adapt more easily to rapidly changing markets . small states are better at public policy adjustments , freeing up labor markets , establishing a solid framework for competition , and facilitating cross-border takeovers and mergers .
the urgency of such a program has been underscored in much recent analysis of the poor performance of the major continental European economies – France , Germany , and Italy – compared with smaller and much more dynamic economies in northern and central Europe . but , at the same time , small states are also more likely to be successful in defending crucial aspects of the welfare state .
a larger state can inevitably do more to control the economy , and hence is exposed to the costly temptation to intervene in response to political pressure from vested interests . in a small-state setting , imposition of a dense network of controls is likely to lead to the loss of mobile factors of production , while in a large state it is harder for labor or capital to escape .
on the international stage , large states try to make international rules , and often build their domestic legitimacy on their claims to be able to shape a larger world : they think in terms of what French thinkers call “ harnessing globalization . ” Instead of accepting the international system roughly as it is , with all its imperfections , they think that they can use their weight to alter the rules – in their favor .
small states ’ nervousness and fear began to increase roughly in 2000 . the new political realities were highlighted by the Iraq war , China ’ s search for energy sources in developing countries , and Russia ’ s assertiveness in foreign and domestic policy .
in today ’ s world , it looks as if the new winners are big states with large populations and rapid growth : Brazil , Russia , India , and China ( BRICs ) , in addition to the United States . these dynamic giants terrify the wealthy populations of the industrialized world with the potential power of their low-cost competition , cheap products , and outsourcing of services .
the BRICs ( we might rewrite the term as Big and Really Imperial Countries ) project power more easily , but they also need to project power to compensate for their weaknesses . they have their own problems , but at the same time they are likely to behave more like traditional big states , and will try to shape globalization rather than simply accepting it as an inevitable process .
there are at least three obvious flaws that afflict these big globalizers much more than the small globalizers who had done so well previously . first , highly populous countries must integrate their poor and ill-educated underclass ( in China and India mostly rural ) as they engage with world markets .
second , China and Russia have financial systems that lack transparency , while Brazil and India are financially underdeveloped , putting further integration in the world economy at risk and increasing prospects for a financial crisis .
third , Russia is already facing massive demographic decline and an aging and sickening population ; China faces the near certainty of a Japanese-style demographic downturn from the 2040 ’ s onward , a belated legacy of its one-child policy .
flawed geo-political giants have in the past been a source of instability ( Germany before World War I is an obvious analogy ) , and there are good reasons to see them presenting increased risk in the twenty-first century . but for the moment they are unquestionably powerful .
the result is that the BRICs will look for compensating power , and military and strategic influence and prestige , as a way to solve internal problems . gone are the 1990 ’ s , when for a brief moment in the immediate aftermath of the end of the Cold War , the world looked as if it would be permanently peaceful and unconcerned with power .
many commentators , indeed , were stunned by the rapidity with which tensions returned to the international system . while many blame US behavior , these tensions have in fact been fueled by the unfolding of a new logic in international politics .
the Rising Power of NGO \ u0027s
according to the Internet database Factiva , 43 news articles mentioned the report , in publications ranging from the Kansas City Star to the Beirut Daily Star . similarly , after the abuses of Iraqi detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison were disclosed , the views of Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross put pressure on the Bush administration both at home and abroad .
as these examples suggest , today &apos;s information age has been marked by the growing role of non-governmental organizations ( NGO &apos;s ) on the international stage . this is not entirely new , but modern communications have led to a dramatic increase in scale , with the number of NGO &apos;s jumping from 6,000 to approximately 26,000 during the 1990 &apos;s alone .
they develop new norms by directly pressing governments and businesses to change policies , and indirectly by altering public perceptions of what governments and firms should do . NGO &apos;s do not have coercive &quot; hard &quot; power , but they often enjoy considerable &quot; soft &quot; power - the ability to get the outcomes they want through attraction rather than compulsion .
a few decades ago , large organizations like multinational corporations or the Roman Catholic Church were the most typical type of transnational organization . such organizations remain important , but the reduced cost of communication in the Internet era has opened the field to loosely structured network organizations with little headquarters staff and even to individuals .
in addition to Human Rights Watch , other NGO &apos;s such as Transparency International , Oxfam , and Doctors without Borders have undergone exponential growth in terms of mainstream media mentions . by this measure , the biggest NGO &apos;s have become established players in the battle for the attention of influential editors .
even large countries with hard power , such as the United States , are affected . NGO &apos;s played key roles in the disruption of the World Trade Organization summit in 1999 , the passage of the Landmines Treaty , and the ratification of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in May 2003 .
the US , for example , initially had strong objections to the Convention on Tobacco Control , but dropped them in the face of international criticism . the Landmines Treaty was created despite the opposition of the strongest bureaucracy ( the Pentagon ) in the world &apos;s largest military power .
similarly , transnational corporations are often targets of NGO campaigns to &quot; name and shame &quot; companies that pay low wages in poor countries . such campaigns sometimes succeed because they can credibly threaten to damage the value of global brand names .
this decision came two years after the company acceded to pressure from environmentalists and scrapped plans to drill in a World Heritage site in Bangladesh . transnational drug companies were shamed by NGO &apos;s into abandoning lawsuits in South Africa in 2002 over infringements of their patents on drugs to fight AIDS .
NGO &apos;s vary enormously in their organization , budgets , accountability , and sense of responsibility for the accuracy of their claims . it is hyperbole when activists call such movements &quot; the world &apos;s other superpower , &quot; yet governments ignore them at their peril .
some have reputations and credibility that give them impressive domestic as well as international soft power . others lack credibility among moderate citizens but can mobilize demonstrations that demand the attention of governments .
yet they tend to pluralize world politics by calling attention to issues that governments prefer to ignore , and by acting as pressure groups across borders . in that sense , they serve as antidotes to traditional government bureaucracies .
governments remain the major actors in world politics , but they now must share the stage with many more competitors for attention . non-governmental actors are changing world politics .
the Rising Sons of North Africa
London – The role played by Libyan ruler Muammar al-Qaddafi ’ s son , Saif al-Islam , in gaining the release of the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi , and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ’ s state visit to Washington accompanied by his son , Gamal , suggest that dynastic successions are underway in both countries .
Mubarak and Qaddafi , along with Tunisia ’ s Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali and Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria , are among the world ’ s oldest and longest-serving heads of state . all four face the ticklish problem of succession , and speculation has been mounting for some time of possible attempts to keep power in the family .
that solution is becoming pretty commonplace , from the Aliyevs of Azerbaijan to the Kims of North Korea to the Assads in Syria . dynastic succession safeguards the immediate and frequently extensive interests of the ruling family as well as those of the wider political and business elite .
yet , despite these authoritarian leaders ’ apparently solid grip on power , ensuring that a relative takes over is not as simple as it seems . the problem boils down to overcoming possible resistance – from both the elite and the public – that could derail the handover or undermine the successor ’ s authority .
dealing with elite interests requires ingenuity . lucrative business opportunities can be allocated to soothe the successor ’ s political adversaries , while renegades can be targeted to discourage others – for example , by being stripped of property or dismissed from positions of influence .
securing popular legitimacy requires equal dexterity , which has played an important role in preventing North African leaders and family members from openly admitting their preparations for dynastic successions .
in Egypt , where such preparations are the most obvious , Gamal and other senior figures have stubbornly denied his presidential ambitions . at the same time , room has been made for Gamal to build a public profile of his own through his senior role in the ruling party , and a constitutional framework has been put in place that will allow him to be elected in multi-candidate elections , thus establishing a façade of republican legitimacy .
Ben Ali ’ s son-in-law , Sakhr el-Materi , was last year elected to the central committee of the ruling Rassemblement Constitutionnel Démocratique party . in Algeria , Bouteflika ’ s brother , Said , has been linked to a “ grassroots ” movement that – it is rumored – could eventually serve as a basis for his succession bid .
in Libya , Saif al-Islam has sought to distinguish himself as an agent of democratic change by setting up “ non-governmental ” organizations , establishing “ independent ” media outlets , and even sponsoring his own private drafting committee for a new constitution . but he has encountered stubborn resistance from key elite groups , who regard his agenda as a threat to their vested interests .
in Libya , the regime ’ s founding myth is inextricably linked to Qaddafi ’ s 1969 coup and his eclectic political theories . his departure would expose the anachronistic nature of the state ’ s ideological foundation ; family ties will do nothing to protect his successor from the resulting shock to the system .
but Bouteflika ’ s most likely successors , including his brother , almost certainly will not have this tie . as in Egypt , public opposition to a succession seen to threaten the republican order could sharpen the army ’ s understanding of itself as guardian of the state , prompting it to intervene .
in Egypt , Gamal Mubarak will have to counter the widespread perception that his interests are aligned with close allies among the business elite , notably steel tycoon Ahmed el-Ezz . Gamal could seek to dispel this perception by publicly making examples of regime cronies involved in excesses .
keeping everyone in suspense helps prevent the emergence of organized opposition to a dynastic succession . moreover , they may worry that heirs apparent will seek to force them out of office prematurely .
thus , Ben Ali has demoted prominent politicians back when they attained sufficient influence to be considered potential successors . he is apparently concerned that one of them could imitate a coup like the one he led in 1987 that toppled Habib Bourguiba .
in Libya , the fortunes of Saif al-Islam and Muatasim have waxed and waned as Qaddafi enforces his authority to prevent the emergence of a challenger . while few obstacles remain in Gamal ’ s path to power in Egypt , in Algeria , meanwhile , a bid to install Said would likely collapse against resistance from powerful regime interests .
the Rising Wealth of Nations
the latest figures are for 2004 , and , because of data lags , not all countries are included . yet these numbers are valuable because they are of exceptional quality and they correct systematically for relative price differences across countries , which sometimes leads to surprising results .
among the 82 countries for which 2004 data are now available , there has been really good news : real per capita GDP has risen by an average of 18.9 % between 2000 and 2004 , or 4.4 % per year . people generally are a lot better off than they were just a few years ago .
many people who could not afford a car in 2000 now have one , and people who could afford only one car in 2000 now have two . people who could not afford to send their children to a good school or college now can .
the reason China has not risen higher is that other countries have been growing too , and because the gaps between countries are enormous . the range between the poorest and the richest countries in the world is a factor of more than 100 .
as they pass by , all spread out , one sees that some runners seem to be gaining rapidly . and yet they do not often overtake one another , because the distances between them are so large .
if such growth rates continue , we will see relatively poor countries like India , Indonesia , the Philippines , or Nicaragua reach the average levels currently enjoyed by advanced countries in 50 years . but , of course , they will not have caught up with these countries , for those countries will have moved ahead too .
it is hard to imagine now what that world will be like with a doubling or quadrupling of just about every country ’ s GDP . what would all these countries do with all that money ?
he wrote : “ So great has been the change &#91; in standards of living &#93; that many of the desires of the individual are no longer even evident to him . they become so only as they are synthesized , elaborated and nurtured by advertising and salesmanship , and these , in turn , have become among our most important and talented professions . ”
but real per capita GDP in the US is now three times higher than it was in 1958 . what have people been spending all that extra money on ?
according to my calculations comparing 1958 and 2005 data from the US Department of Commerce , Americans spent 27 % of the huge increase in income between 1958 and 2005 on medical care , 23 % on their homes , 12 % on transportation , 10 % on recreation , and 9 % on personal business activities .
food got only 8 % of the extra money , clothing only 3 % , and personal care 1 % . unfortunately , idealistic activities also received little of the extra money : 3 % for welfare and religious activities , and a similar share for education .
thus , most of the extra money was spent on staying healthy , having a nice home , traveling and relaxing , and doing a little business .
maybe that is the way it will be around the world . as long as we can keep worldwide growth going at its current rate , billions of people can look forward to the same kind of improvement .
the Risk of European Centralization
Frankfurt – For many European leaders , the eurozone crisis demonstrates the need for “ more Europe , ” the final aim being to create a full-fledged political union . given the continent ’ s history of war and ideological division , and today ’ s challenges posed by globalization , a peaceful , prosperous , and united Europe that wields influence abroad is surely a desirable goal .
but the crisis confronting “ Europe ” is not so much about political union as it is about European Economic and Monetary Union . if anything , efforts to hold EMU together may have taken us further from the goal of a common foreign policy by re-igniting within member states ( regardless of whether they give or receive financial aid ) nationalist resentments that we hoped had died long ago .
later , the eurozone ’ s “ no bail-out ” principle was abandoned . the response to these failings , however , was a demand for greater economic integration , including such intermediate steps as the creation of a “ European finance minister ” or an EU commissioner with sweeping powers to facilitate closer integration .
such ideas , of course , ignored the central issues of national sovereignty and democracy , and specifically the privilege of nationally elected governments and parliaments to determine their own taxes and public spending . the fact that sovereign member states did not deliver on their European commitments is hardly a convincing argument for giving up sovereignty now .
they have fueled tensions among member states . perhaps most important , they have undermined the basis on which political union rests – namely , persuading European Union citizens to identify with the European idea .
indeed , it is Europe ’ s economic achievements that give it a political voice in the world . but , as the current crisis indicates , the best-performing EU economies are those with ( relatively ) flexible labor markets , reasonable tax rates , and open access to professions and business .
moreover , the impetus for economic reform has come not from the EU , but from national governments , one of the most successful examples being “ Agenda 2010 , ” launched a decade ago by then-German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder . numerous academic studies , following the work of the American economic historian Douglass North , support the notion that it is competition among states and regions that lays the groundwork for technological progress and economic growth .
arguably , in earlier centuries , it was competition within Europe that generated unparalleled dynamism and prosperity across much of the continent . to be sure , this was also a time of wars .
but , once again , EU leaders responded by concluding the opposite : the Lisbon Agenda ’ s failure was interpreted as justifying still more harmonization and centralization of national policies . true to form , in his “ State of the Union ” address to the European Parliament in September 2012 , European Commission President José Manuel Barroso called for a more powerful Commission .
it is the sort of pretense of knowledge that the economist Friedrich von Hayek denounced as a recipe for constraining freedom and ensuring economic mediocrity . indeed , the European project should start from the premise that appropriate institutions , property rights , and competition , together with a growth-friendly tax system and solid fiscal policies , are the basis of economic success .
the dangers of a centralizing approach can also be seen in the relationship between the 17 current eurozone members and the 11 non-eurozone EU states . as the former press on with greater integration , the adverse economic consequences of doing so are likely to deter the latter from EMU participation ( which may be another sign that institutional competition cannot be suppressed forever ) .
environmental policy is clearly one . but centralization of economic decision-making , as an end in itself , cannot underpin a prosperous and powerful Europe .
Jean Monnet , one of the EU ’ s founding fathers , once said that , given the chance to start the European integration process again , he would have begun with culture – a dimension in which we neither need nor want centralization . Europe ’ s cultural richness consists precisely in its diversity , and the basis for its finest achievements has been competition between people , institutions , and places .
green Sovereign Wealth
Paris – At the end of 2011 , sovereign-wealth funds ’ assets under management amounted to $ 3 trillion , following 237 direct investments worth $ 81 billion that year . some experts even estimate SWFs ’ assets to be worth $ 6 trillion .
European countries rank first among hosts for SWF investments , accounting for more than 40 % of the total value of deals in 2011 . the United States , where opposition to such investments has been stronger , accounts for less than 10 % .
these countries ’ concerns are not entirely unfounded . SWFs pose concrete risks , some of which have already materialized , to the global economy and to financial markets both at home and in host countries .
in general , however , opacity is a defining feature of most SWFs , exacerbating the risks that they pose . while some SWFs , like Norway ’ s Government Pension Fund – Global , are transparent , little information is available on most SWFs ’ size , portfolio holdings , investment strategy , performance , or mode of governance .
twenty-five countries have signed on to the Principles since 2008 . but , while they are an important first step toward managing SWFs ’ legal framework , institutional and governance structure , and investment and risk-management policies , they are unevenly applied , and are widely considered inadequate .
given the geographical distribution of SWFs and their investments , truly global regulation is highly unlikely . but , without closer monitoring , SWFs will inevitably face politically motivated restrictions by some host countries , so it is in their interest to intensify their efforts at self-regulation .
the need to increase the transparency of SWF operations should not be allowed to eclipse their potential benefits . as long-term investors , SWFs can help to reduce market volatility through financial intermediation , as well as contribute to financing projects with positive but long-term rates of return .
unlike insurance companies and pension funds , they have no long-term debt or future payment obligations . and , as public investors , they are likely to have a better understanding of investment projects that depend on public policy .
new financial regulations – Basel 3 for banks and Solvency 2 for insurers – are reinforcing these advantages . while the regulations are likely to reduce the likelihood and impact of financial crises , they will also make long-term loans more expensive and investments in illiquid assets riskier .
as a result , banks and insurers might disengage from infrastructure finance , creating more opportunity at lower cost for SWFs . given that infrastructure is crucial to sustainable development , this could eventually lead SWFs to become key players in this area .
in 2011 , SWFs invested $ 35.2 billion in financial services , $ 13.4 billion in property , $ 13.2 billion in fossil-fuel resources ( mainly oil and gas ) , $ 6.5 billion in infrastructure and utilities , and $ 3.4 billion in aircraft , car , ship , and train manufacturers . given that SWFs ’ primary objective is to transfer wealth to future generations , their high level of exposure to fossil-fuel markets is unsustainable .
indeed , the remaining carbon-emissions “ budget ” until 2050 , adherence to which is required to limit the global temperature increase to 2 ° C , is five times smaller than the carbon equivalent of proven fossil-fuel reserves . this means that only 20 % of these reserves , based on which SWF assets are valued , can be burned unabated .
some SWFs in the Middle East and Asia seem to understand the risks associated with carbon-heavy investment portfolios , and are ready to work together to create a platform to finance resource-efficient , low-carbon , environmentally friendly infrastructure projects . indeed , the idea was discussed in January at the World Future Energy Summit and the International Renewable Energy Conference in Abu Dhabi .
this initiative should be supported unequivocally , serving as a springboard for a stronger focus on green investment among SWFs . with the right approach , SWFs can offer significant long-term benefits to all .
ten QE Questions
new YORK – Most observers regard unconventional monetary policies such as quantitative easing ( QE ) as necessary to jump-start growth in today ’ s anemic economies . but questions about the effectiveness and risks of QE have begun to multiply as well .
the bond channel doesn ’ t work when bond yields are already low ; and the credit channel doesn ’ t work when banks hoard liquidity and velocity collapses . indeed , those who can borrow ( high-grade firms and prime households ) don ’ t want or need to , while those who need to – highly leveraged firms and non-prime households – can ’ t , owing to the credit crunch .
moreover , the stock-market channel leading to asset reflation following QE works only in the short run if growth fails to recover . and the reduction in real interest rates via a rise in expected inflation when open-ended QE is implemented risks eventually stoking inflation expectations .
third , the foreign-exchange channel of QE transmission – the currency weakening implied by monetary easing – is ineffective if several major central banks pursue QE at the same time . when that happens , QE becomes a zero-sum game , because not all currencies can fall , and not all trade balances can improve , simultaneously .
sterilized foreign-exchange intervention keeps domestic interest rates high and feeds the inflows . but unsterilized intervention and / or reducing domestic interest rates creates excessive liquidity that can feed domestic inflation and / or asset and credit bubbles .
yet imposing capital controls on inflows is difficult and sometimes leaky . macroprudential controls on credit growth are useful , but sometimes ineffective in stopping asset bubbles when low interest rates continue to underpin generous liquidity conditions .
although QE may be justified by weak economic and growth fundamentals , keeping rates too low for too long can eventually feed such bubbles . that is what happened in 2000-2006 , when the US Federal Reserve aggressively cut the federal funds rate to 1 % during the 2001 recession and subsequent weak recovery and then kept rates down , thus fueling credit / housing / subprime bubbles .
sixth , QE can create moral-hazard problems by weakening governments ’ incentive to pursue needed economic reforms . it may also delay needed fiscal austerity if large deficits are monetized , and , by keeping rates too low , prevent the market from imposing discipline .
also , if exit occurs by selling the long-term assets purchased during QE , a sharp increase in interest rates might choke off recovery , resulting in large financial losses for holders of long-term bonds . and , if the exit occurs via a rise in the interest rate on excess reserves ( to sterilize the effect of a base-money overhang on credit growth ) , the ensuing losses for central banks ’ balance sheets could be significant .
eighth , an extended period of negative real interest rates implies a redistribution of income and wealth from creditors and savers toward debtors and borrowers . of all the forms of adjustment that can lead to deleveraging ( growth , savings , orderly debt restructuring , or taxation of wealth ) , debt monetization ( and eventually higher inflation ) is the least democratic , and it seriously damages savers and creditors , including pensioners and pension funds .
ninth , QE and other unconventional monetary policies can have serious unintended consequences . eventually , excessive inflation may erupt , or credit growth may slow , rather than accelerate , if banks – faced with very low net interest-rate margins – decide that risk relative to reward is insufficient .
indeed , some countries are ditching their inflation-targeting regime and moving into uncharted territory , where there may be no anchor for price expectations . the US has moved from QE1 to QE2 and now to QE3 , which is potentially unlimited and linked to an unemployment target .
in short , policies are becoming more unconventional , not less , with little clarity about short-term effects , unintended consequences , and long-term impacts . to be sure , QE and other unconventional monetary policies do have important short-term benefits .
Asia ’ s Rebalancing Act
indeed , strong Chinese demand has supported its trading partners ’ export-led growth for much of the past three decades . but now , faced with a slowdown in China and significant downside risks there , the rest of Asia must abandon over-reliance on export-oriented development strategies and strive to ensure stable and sustainable growth domestically and regionally .
China ’ s vulnerabilities and risks – stemming from property bubbles , shadow banking , and local-government debt – have triggered concerns about a crisis not only there , but also in neighboring Asian countries . some , indeed , now predict a Chinese banking or fiscal disaster ; others predict long-term stagnation equivalent to Japan ’ s lost decades .
no one can guarantee that Prime Minister Li Keqiang ’ s attempts to achieve deleveraging and structural reform will succeed . moreover , external shocks , policy mistakes , and political instability could disrupt even the best-laid plans .
even if it manages a “ soft landing , ” annual output growth will slow to 5-6 % in the coming decades . standard growth theory predicts “ convergence ” of per capita GDP : a fast-growing country will eventually encounter difficulty maintaining high rates of labor mobilization , capital accumulation , and technological progress .
reduced rates of return will lower investment rates . China may be able to rely on policy reforms to boost productivity growth ; but , with relatively low innovative capacity , it will struggle to catch up with frontier technologies .
China ’ s inevitable growth slowdown , along with a large tail risk , threatens stable growth in Asian economies that have become increasingly interdependent . trade within Asia now accounts for more than half of the continent ’ s total trade turnover .
from 2001 to 2011 , China ’ s share of South Korean exports doubled , from 12 % to 24 % ; its share of Japanese exports grew even faster , rising from 8 % to 20 % . as a result , China has become South Korea ’ s single largest export market , and Japan ’ s second largest .
in terms of investment , the International Monetary Fund predicts that a disruption in China ’ s investment boom will adversely affect its trading partners . a drop of one percentage point in China ’ s investment rate is estimated to reduce Taiwan ’ s GDP growth rate by 0.9 percentage points and Korea ’ s by 0.6 percentage points .
if China can successfully rebalance its economy and shift to consumption-based growth , its trading partners could benefit enormously from a huge retail market . but as long as China ’ s import share of final consumption remains low , direct gains for exporters of consumer goods are likely to be small .
as they prepare for the coming Chinese slowdown and seek to minimize the risk of regional destabilization , Asian economies must strengthen domestic demand and reduce excessive reliance on exports to China . in other words , sustainable growth requires all of Asia ’ s China-dependent economies to rebalance their two main growth engines .
to enhance domestic demand , Asia , including China , must reallocate resources and structurally transform the economy . reinforcing social safety nets , broadening and deepening financial markets , and supporting small and medium-size enterprises would also strengthen domestic demand .
but a second reform front , aimed at enhancing regional coordination , must also be opened . with economic shocks able to spread more quickly than ever before , owing to broadened trade and financial channels , all Asian countries must maintain a sound macroeconomic environment .
perhaps most important , deeper regional integration calls for closer cooperation in macroeconomic and financial surveillance , as envisaged by the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization . Asian countries must be able to conduct well-coordinated candid reviews of one another to reduce the likelihood of risks and detect emerging vulnerabilities .
China ’ s long-term growth potential – and that of the rest of developing Asia – is not pre-defined . maximizing it requires not only that individual countries address their weaknesses and rebalance their sources of growth , but also that they build and strengthen the regional institutions needed to manage economic integration .
the Temptation of China ’ s Capital Account
Beijing – Despite fluctuations , China ’ s overall economic growth has been stable over the last three decades , owing not only to the economy ’ s strong fundamentals , but also to the government ’ s successful management of cross-border capital flows .
capital controls enabled China to emerge from the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 largely unscathed , even though its financial system was at least as fragile as those of the affected countries . the Asian financial crisis persuaded China ’ s leaders to shelve plans , launched in 1994 , to liberalize the capital account .
the authorities also introduced the “ qualified domestic institutional investors ” ( QDII ) program to enable residents to invest in foreign assets – one of many initiatives aimed at easing upward pressure on the renminbi ’ s exchange rate by encouraging capital outflows . at the same time , the “ qualified foreign institutional investors ” ( QFII ) scheme allowed licensed foreign entities to invest in domestic capital markets .
in early 2012 , the People ’ s Bank of China ( PBOC ) released a report calling for policymakers to take advantage of a “ strategic opportunity ” to accelerate capital-account liberalization . shortly after the release , QFII quotas were relaxed significantly .
although currency internationalization is not tantamount to capital-account liberalization , progress on the former presupposes progress on the latter . by allowing enterprises to choose currencies for trade settlement , and creating renminbi “ recycling mechanisms , ” the government effectively eased the restrictions on short-term cross-border capital flows .
most economists in China seem to support the PBOC ’ s stance , citing the potential benefits of capital-account liberalization . but Chinese policymakers should also recognize the significant risks inherent in relaxing capital controls .
a third reason to go slow on easing capital controls is that China ’ s economic reforms remain incomplete , with property rights not yet clearly defined . amid ambiguity over ownership and pervasive corruption , the free flow of capital across borders would encourage money laundering and asset-stripping , which would incite social tension .
owing to its underdeveloped financial system and inefficient capital markets , China would be unable to withstand an attack akin to those that triggered the Asian financial crisis without the protection of capital controls . already , even without a major speculative attack , the exchange-rate and interest-rate arbitrage facilitated by renminbi internationalization have imposed significant losses on China .
but a broad framework for determining the timing of each policy step , based on rigorous cost-benefit analysis , is essential . while some measures that the PBOC has taken under the banner of capital-account liberalization have turned out to be both necessary and appropriately moderate , others may need to be reassessed and rescinded .
today , as all major developed economies resort to expansionary monetary policy , the global economy is being flooded with excess liquidity , and a “ currency war ” is looming large . as a result , short-term capital inflows , whether seeking a safe haven or conducting carry trades , are bound to become larger and more volatile .
on the contrary , policymakers should tread carefully in their pursuit of financial liberalization . given China ’ s extensive reform agenda , further opening of the capital account can wait ; and , in view of liberalization ’ s ambiguous benefits and significant risks , it should .
brave New Cells ?
supporters of such research are framing criticism of it as opposition to saving children ’ s lives and an impediment to scientific development . but this view neglects a crucial factor in the debate : the techniques being developed involve permanent genetic alterations passed on to future generations .
so the real question is how the public feels about crossing the line between medical treatments for existingpeople and irreversible genetic alterations that would be passed on to future generations through genetic modification of the human germline ( the sequence of germ cells , such as sperm and eggs , containing genetic material that a child may inherit ) .
indeed , not only do most scientists and governments worldwide consider human germline genetic modification unacceptable ; it is expressly prohibited in more than 40 countries , including the UK . as a result , experts in the United States , Canada , Germany , Israel , and elsewhere have responded critically to the prospect of Britain unilaterally undermining the consensus that prohibits such techniques .
despite this relatively low frequency , the Wellcome Trust ( an organization dedicated to improving human and animal health ) recently donated £ 4 million ( $ 6.5 million ) to scientists at the University of Newcastle to establish a center for mitochondrial research . in a 2010 paper , the scientists reported some early success with a technique involving the use of human zygotes ( single-cell embryos ) that had been engineered to contain only healthy mitochondria .
but “ treatment ” does not mean helping existing sufferers . rather , the techniques might allow a small subset of women with mitochondrial disease ( in the UK , roughly 10-20 annually ) to reduce the risk that their children will inherit the mutation – at the cost of setting a precedent with serious potential consequences .
nonetheless , critics fear the slippery slope . after all , breaching the ethical and legal barrier to permanent genetic modification could make it more difficult to block its application for treating non-lethal conditions , or even for enhancing qualities like cognitive ability or athletic prowess .
but the more urgent threat is that any kind of germline genetic modification could do long-term , permanent damage . the HFEA ’ s own expert panel reported that the safety of mitochondrial techniques is far from being proven for current users .
given that the defective eggs miscarry naturally , more eggs than expected would be needed for the technique – possibly posing a risk to the donors . indeed , in their study , the team used 106 eggs from seven women , one of whom donated a total of 28 eggs , indicating possible ovarian hyperstimulation , which can be dangerous or even fatal .
germline genetic modification threatens to make such errors permanent . the UK scientific and charitable organizations advocating mitochondrial research are proud of the permissive legislative framework that has enabled them to establish an “ international lead . ”
taming the Arctic Oil Rush
on one hand , we stand to lose one of the Earth ’ s largest and most significant ecosystems . on the other hand , the once fabled northeast and northwest passages will reduce shipping times and costs by as much as half , bringing China and Japan much closer to Europe and North America ’ s east coast .
on land , oil fields in Alaska and gas fields in northern Russia have been producing hydrocarbons on a large scale for many years , but the estimated reserves under the Arctic Ocean are much larger . at today ’ s prices , these reserves could be worth more than $ 7 trillion , according to international energy companies ; factoring in the accompanying natural gas , $ 10 trillion would probably be a conservative figure .
because much of the Arctic Ocean is shallow and located on continental shelves , the bordering countries are scrambling to stake claims to exclusive economic zones under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea . the political heat is also being turned up in the Arctic Council , a body set up to facilitate cooperation between states with Arctic territories .
Rosneft has also signed exploration agreements with Statoil , ExxonMobil , and Eni . of the large oil companies , only one – France ’ s Total – has argued against Arctic oil exploration and exploitation on the grounds of environmental risks and economic costs .
even if the Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free in the summer , most of the year it is not , and icebergs from melting glaciers will become more common and possibly larger . this , together with frequent , powerful , and icy storms that appear on short notice , increases the likelihood of blowouts and other spills .
then there are the problems associated with remoteness . the BP disaster in 2010 happened in the best possible place in terms of nearby resources for capping a blowout : the Gulf of Mexico contains the world ’ s largest concentration of oil companies , subcontractors , petroleum engineers , equipment , workshops , etc .
in cold waters , however , recovery takes much longer , as the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989 demonstrated . the rule of thumb that chemical and biochemical processes double in speed with each increase of ten degrees Celsius is a reasonable approximation here , too .
meanwhile , in the low biodiversity ecosystems of the Arctic , with their simple food webs , so-called cascading effects are more pronounced than in temperate or warm regions . the demise of one species or trophic level ( which contains organisms performing the same function in the food chain ) , leads to changes in others in a rapid sequence that is difficult to foresee .
the new US rules for offshore oil operations in the Arctic – which forced Shell to postpone drilling until next year – are certainly stricter than the old rules , and will reduce the risk of a blowout . but , if one occurs , the only reliable way to stop it and cap the well is to drill a relief well .
there is , however , one way to shorten the time required to cap a well to a matter of days : drill two holes in parallel from the start . in case of a blowout in one hole , the other could quickly become the relief well .
obviously , this would cause the cost of drilling to increase significantly .
the Risky Rich
traditionally , sovereign risk has been concentrated in emerging-market economies . after all , in the last decade or so , Russia , Argentina , and Ecuador defaulted on their public debts , while Pakistan , Ukraine , and Uruguay coercively restructured their public debt under the threat of default .
but , in large part – and with a few exceptions in Central and Eastern Europe – emerging-market economies improved their fiscal performance by reducing overall deficits , running large primary surpluses , lowering their stock of public debt-to-GDP ratios , and reducing the currency and maturity mismatches in their public debt . as a result , sovereign risk today is a greater problem in advanced economies than in most emerging-market economies .
the impact was greater in countries that had a history of structural fiscal problems , maintained loose fiscal policies , and ignored fiscal reforms during the boom years . in the future , a weak economic recovery and an aging population are likely to increase the debt burden of many advanced economies , including the United States , the UK , Japan , and several euro-zone countries .
more ominously , monetization of these fiscal deficits is becoming a pattern in many advanced economies , as central banks have started to swell the monetary base via massive purchases of short- and long-term government paper . eventually , large monetized fiscal deficits will lead to a fiscal train wreck and / or a rise in inflation expectations that could sharply increase long-term government bond yields and crowd out a tentative and so far fragile economic recovery .
if they remove the stimulus too soon by raising taxes , cutting spending , and mopping up the excess liquidity , the economy may fall back into recession and deflation . but if monetized fiscal deficits are allowed to run , the increase in long-term yields will put a chokehold on growth .
countries with weaker initial fiscal positions – such as Greece , the UK , Ireland , Spain , and Iceland – have been forced by the market to implement early fiscal consolidation . while that could be contractionary , the gain in fiscal-policy credibility might prevent a damaging spike in long-term government-bond yields .
these countries had already lost export-market shares to China and other low value-added and labor-intensive Asian economies . then a decade of nominal-wage growth that out-paced productivity gains led to a rise in unit labor costs , real exchange-rate appreciation , and large current-account deficits .
the euro ’ s recent sharp rise has made this competitiveness problem even more severe , reducing growth further and making fiscal imbalances even larger . so the question is whether these euro-zone members will be willing to undergo painful fiscal consolidation and internal real depreciation through deflation and structural reforms in order to increase productivity growth and prevent an Argentine-style outcome : exit from the monetary union , devaluation , and default .
the US and Japan might be among the last to face the wrath of the bond-market vigilantes : the dollar is the main global reserve currency , and foreign-reserve accumulation – mostly US government bills and bonds – continues at a rapid pace . Japan is a net creditor and largely finances its debt domestically .
the US is a net debtor with an aging population , unfunded entitlement spending on social security and health care , an anemic economic recovery , and risks of continued monetization of the fiscal deficit . Japan is aging even faster , and economic stagnation is reducing domestic savings , while the public debt is approaching 200 % of GDP .
the US also faces political constraints to fiscal consolidation : Americans are deluding themselves that they can enjoy European-style social spending while maintaining low tax rates , as under President Ronald Reagan . at least European voters are willing to pay higher taxes for their public services .
if America ’ s Democrats lose in the mid-term elections this November , there is a risk of persistent fiscal deficits as Republicans veto tax increases while Democrats veto spending cuts . monetizing the fiscal deficits would then become the path of least resistance : running the printing presses is much easier than politically painful deficit reduction .
but if the US does use the inflation tax as a way to reduce the real value of its public debt , the risk of a disorderly collapse of the US dollar would rise significantly . America ’ s foreign creditors would not accept a sharp reduction in their dollar assets ’ real value that debasement of the dollar via inflation and devaluation would entail .
the Road to Arab Democracy
instead , it wrought for France – and much of Europe – Jacobin terror , right-wing counter-terror , decades of war , and eventually Napoleonic tyranny . a similar challenge now faces North Africa and the Middle East , where most Arab countries are experiencing massive upheavals .
for the first time , Arab authoritarian regimes have been toppled , and others are threatened , by mass demonstrations calling for freedom and democracy . previously , Arab regimes changed through military coups and other sorts of putsches , never through popular revolutions .
during the great democratic wave of the 1990 ’ s , which brought down dictatorships in Eastern Europe , Latin America , sub-Saharan Africa , and Southeast Asia , nothing similar happened in Arab North Africa and the Middle East . now , however , the region ’ s political inertia has been disrupted .
much more oppressive and ruthless rulers – Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya , Bashar Assad in Syria , and Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen – though seriously threatened , have proven far more resilient ( up to now ) in suppressing popular opposition . even in tiny Bahrain , the Sunni minority has , for now , succeeded in maintaining its rule over the Shia majority , albeit with military help from neighboring Sunni-led countries .
as always , it is easier to bring down an autocracy than to construct and consolidate a democratic regime . when communism in Eastern Europe collapsed , their old systems , despite some obvious differences , had the same characteristics : they were one-party dictatorships , with state control over the economy , education , and the media .
developments in Egypt will be crucial , not only because it is the largest Arab country , but also because some of the necessary pre-conditions appear to have a stronger presence there than elsewhere in the region . yet , even in Egypt , the challenges are enormous .
at the moment , only the army – which has effectively ruled the country since 1952 – and the Muslim Brotherhood , which has the widest social networks , appear to be serious players . will the army , whose monopoly of power is paradoxically legitimized by the massive demonstrations that toppled Mubarak , be willing to give up the enormous political and economic clout that it has amassed over decades ?
indeed , some activists are already back in Tahrir Square demonstrating against such an incongruous yet possible alliance . in Libya , if Qaddafi falls , can such a highly tribalized country possess the building blocks needed for a functioning democracy ?
like Christian churches , Islam can also change , and Indonesia and Turkey could well be examples for such a possibility . but a context in which a fundamentalist Islamic group like the Muslim Brotherhood is the strongest organization in society , with very little effective countervailing powers , creates a serious challenge .
it may be difficult to know , especially as the fundamentalist Hamas , now in control of Gaza , might be encouraged by the rising power of its parent organization in Egypt . the recent escalation of violence along Gaza ’ s border with Israel does suggest that events are developing in a dangerous direction .
as for Israel , it initially responded to the Arab revolts in a confused way . now its leaders maintain that they would welcome democratic changes in the region as a guarantor of peace and common values , though they express skepticism about whether such developments are actually imminent .
skepticism is in order also with respect to the unknown consequences of Western military intervention in Libya : it may have been asked for by the Arab League and legitimized by the UN Security Council , yet the outcome is far from certain . whatever happens in Libya will have repercussions across the region .
the road to democracy has always been rocky – look at a century of upheavals in Europe and the difficulties the US faced when dealing with slavery and the rights of its black population . it is to be hoped that there will be a light at the end of the tunnel in the Arab Middle East as well , but the tunnel may be a long one .
the Road to Food Security
Rome – Recently , I was on a road in the Southern Choma District of Zambia to meet with Rosemary Pisani , a smallholder farmer and mother of eight who struggled to feed her children prior to joining a farmer ’ s cooperative to raise goats . thanks to the cooperative and support from other farmers , she now has a thriving business and all of her children are in school .
on the way to meet her , I passed women walking through mud to the market with large loads of fruit and vegetables stacked on their heads . I imagined how I might be on my way to a very different rural community if the road we were on was paved and well maintained .
this leaves rural areas , which have the potential to feed the more than one billion hungry people , cut off and isolated . in sub-Saharan Africa , almost 70 % of all people living in rural areas live more than a 30-minute walk from the nearest maintained road .
Kofi Annan , Chairperson of the Board of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa ( AGRA ) , has acknowledged this isolation : “ The average African smallholding farmer swims alone . she has no insurance against erratic weather patterns , gets no subsidies , and has no access to credit .
the Green Revolution of the last century had a tremendous impact on agricultural yields and food production , transforming the lives of millions of people . much of this success stemmed from infrastructure that was already in place .
in Ethiopia , only 2 % of rural people have access to electricity , and telephone communication is more or less absent . researchers believe that this is because only 17 % of rural communities in the country live within one mile of a paved road .
as a result , yields are generally too low to allow the millions of rural households to generate marketable surpluses . even if smallholders are able to produce a surplus , their lack of access to downstream activities , such as processing and marketing , prevents them from selling it easily .
both developed and developing countries – caught up in rapid economic expansion and technological development – got distracted . they turned off the tap to agriculture , leaving small farmers to rely on basic farming practices and on government and donor handouts .
in IFAD ’ s experience , working simply to double the income of a smallholder farmer who scrapes by on less than a dollar a day is poverty management , because at two dollars a day , he or she still remains poor . but supporting that smallholder in launching a farming business that could generate a five-fold increase in income amounts to poverty eradication .
if smallholder farmers are to be given the opportunity to become viable businesses , it is essential that they be connected to markets . indeed , support for rural infrastructure – including last-mile roads , electrification , post-harvest facilities , support for agricultural associations and cooperatives , and access to land and irrigation facilities – is a crucial element in the value chain .
we need to link food producers with the people who need their product through viable and well maintained infrastructure . in addition , we need to provide them with research and technology to ensure that they can grow the best-quality produce , and storage capabilities so that they can sell at peak prices .
if smallholder farmers have the basic infrastructure they need to get their goods to market , they will not only be able to feed themselves and their communities , but will contribute to wider food security . we just need to put the pavement down so that farmers like those I saw in Zambia can more easily make their way on the road to food security .
the Roar of the Democratic Wave
Paris – Has the uprising in Tunisia sparked a new democratic wave that will conquer Egypt and eventually sweep away the authoritarian “ Arab exception ” ? after southern Europe in the 1970 ’ s , Latin America in the late 1980 ’ s , and Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990 ’ s , it seems that now it is the Mediterranean region ’ s turn .
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali ’ s ouster in Tunisia signalled the collapse of the Arab “ stability ” model , praised by many Western leaders , consisting of authoritarianism and overrated economic performance . the surge of anger and revolt in Egypt , whatever its final outcome , marks the beginning of the end for authoritarian nationalist Arab regimes .
in contrast to Tunisia , the military is a pillar of the Egyptian regime . but it is unlikely that Egypt ’ s huge ( mostly conscript ) army will engage in massive , violent repression , which would be unprecedented in that country .
even if President Hosni Mubarak hangs on to complete the remainder of his term , the ruling National Democratic Party ’ s regime , its legitimacy irreparably shaken , will not survive for long . Omar Suleiman ’ s appointment as Vice-President ( and heir-apparent ) indicates that the army has accepted that Mubarak must leave sooner or later .
but a protracted and incremental process of small steps towards economic and then political reform – the sequence contemplated by the European Union – is no longer an option . the regime is past reforming , and must give way to a new democratic republic , with a new constitution .
ideally , this should come about in a manner similar to democratic transitions in Latin America in the 1980 ’ s , when authoritarian , army-backed rulers yielded to popular demands for radical , democratic regime change . resorting to thugs to carry out widespread intimidation , and blaming violence on the largely peaceful protests of hundreds of thousands of ordinary Egyptians , as their government has done , is not a good omen .
unlike in Tunisia , Europeans and Americans should increase the pressure on Egypt ’ s leaders – primarily the military at this stage – to start fulfilling the regime ’ s promises of political reform . this will lack credibility under Mubarak , whose refusal to stand down is a recipe for chaos .
· Withdraw support for Mubarak ;
· Support the formation of a transitional authority , supported by the military and the “ street , ” and including independent political figures untainted by the regime , to prepare free and fair elections ;
· Call for an amnesty for all political prisoners .
many of the conditions needed for a democratic transformation – a vibrant and organized civil society , a relatively free press , and well-respected opposition figures , as well as a variety of battered but breathing political parties of different persuasions – are already present .
fear of the Muslim Brotherhood , which is only marginally involved in an uprising that it did not initiate and has no hope of controlling , is no excuse for trying to save a failing regime . the tragic consequences of eleventh-hour attempts to save the Shah in Iran should not be forgotten .
of course , there are concerns about the future of Egypt ’ s foreign policy , especially toward Israel . but there is no indication that a non-authoritarian Egyptian regime would call into question the bilateral peace treaty , though a definite end to the Gaza blockade and a shift in attitude towards Hamas – in the sense of a more serious attempt at forging Palestinian unity – are to be expected .
for Europe , the best option is to support the mass movement calling for regime change led by Mohammed ElBaradei , the Nobel laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
that would be a grave mistake , for such an outcome would most likely pave the way for extreme alternatives . Europe and the US must be as supportive of democracy in the Mediterranean region as they are within Europe itself .
the Rocky Road to Recovery
new YORK – A consensus now exists that America ’ s recession – already a year old – is likely to be long and deep , and that almost all countries will be affected . I always thought that the notion that what happened in America would be decoupled from the rest of the world was a myth .
fortunately , America has , at last , a president with some understanding of the nature and severity of the problem , and who has committed himself to a strong stimulus program . this , together with concerted action by governments elsewhere , will mean that the downturn will be less severe than it otherwise would be .
the United States Federal Reserve , which helped create the problems through a combination of excessive liquidity and lax regulation , is trying to make amends – by flooding the economy with liquidity , a move that , at best , has merely prevented matters from being worse . it ’ s not surprising that those who helped create the problems and didn ’ t see the disaster coming have not done a masterly job in dealing with it .
in some ways , the Fed resembles a drunk driver who , suddenly realizing that he is heading off the road starts careening from side to side . the response to the lack of liquidity is ever more liquidity .
still , I am not sure that there is sufficient appreciation of some of the underlying problems facing the global economy , without which the current global recession is unlikely to give way to robust growth – no matter how good a job the Fed does .
America ’ s profligacy – the fact that the world ’ s richest country could not live within its means – was often criticized . but perhaps the world should be thankful , because without American profligacy , there would have been insufficient global aggregate demand .
indeed , many developing countries , fearful of losing their economic sovereignty to the IMF – as occurred during the 1997 Asian financial crisis – accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves . money put into reserves is income not spent .
moreover , growing inequality in most countries of the world has meant that money has gone from those who would spend it to those who are so well off that , try as they might , they can ’ t spend it all .
the world ’ s unending appetite for oil , beyond its ability or willingness to produce , has contributed a third factor . rising oil prices transferred money to oil-rich countries , again contributing to the flood of liquidity .
but this was just the flip side of what Keynes had worried about – insufficient global aggregate demand . the search for return contributed to the reckless leverage and risk taking that underlay this crisis .
a few years ago , there was worry about the risk of a disorderly unwinding of “ global imbalances . ” The current crisis can be viewed as part of that , but little is being done about the underlying problems that gave rise to these imbalances .
more progressive income taxation will also help stabilize the economy , through what economists call “ automatic stabilizers . ” It would also help if the advanced developed countries fulfilled their commitments to helping the world ’ s poorest by increasing their foreign-aid budgets to 0.7 % of GDP .
second , the world needs enormous investments if it is to respond to the challenges of global warming . transportation systems and living patterns must be changed dramatically .
the dollar reserve system is fraying , but is likely to be replaced with a dollar / euro or dollar / euro / yen system that is even more unstable . annual emissions of a global reserve currency ( what Keynes called Bancor , or the IMF calls SDRs ) could help fuel global aggregate demand , and be used to promote development and address the problems of global warming .
this year will be bleak . the question we need to be asking now is , how can we enhance the likelihood that we will eventually emerge into a robust recovery ?
did Taxes Cause the Financial Crisis ?
Cambridge – After the financial crisis erupted in 2008 , many observers blamed the crisis in large part on the fact that too many financial firms had loaded up on debt while relying on only a thin layer of equity . the reason is straightforward : whereas equity can absorb a business downturn – profits fall , but the firm does not immediately fail – debt is less forgiving , because creditors do not wait around to be paid .
financial firms in the United States pay about 34 % of their profits in taxes , and , while they can deduct interest payments to creditors from taxable income , equity is not taxed as favorably . most countries have similar tax preferences for debt over equity , thereby encouraging financial and other corporations to use more debt , as financial analysts have long known .
and yet the argument that this tax preference for debt played a role in the financial crisis – and that it remains an ongoing risk to financial stability – was quickly rejected . after all , the tax preference for debt has existed for a long time , and nothing heightened it before the crisis hit .
all of this is true , but , given the possibility of a major overhaul of US corporate taxation , which President Barack Obama has proposed , we should revisit the conventional wisdom concerning the supposedly weak connection between corporate taxation and the financial crisis . indeed , in my view , policymakers , academics , and the media have rejected too resolutely the idea that corporate taxation played no more than a minor role .
and , yes , tax incentives are not the only – and perhaps not even the most important – reason why financial institutions use a lot of debt and minimize equity . most important , while reliance on debt made financial institutions riskier , creditors knew that , in a crisis , the government would probably bail out the largest , if not all of them .
destabilized by too much short-term debt and too much exposure to risky , overvalued , low-quality mortgage-backed securities , they tripped and fell over it . so regulators have focused on command-and-control orders to financial firms to increase their equity , and to reduce the riskiness of their investments .
but consider another way of viewing the crisis and our financial institutions : the financial system was never all that far from the cliff ’ s edge , even before 2008 , because the tax system encouraged financial firms to overload themselves with debt . they generally managed themselves and their risks well , so they did not fall .
the policy consensus has properly focused first on the new risks that were added . but focusing on those added risks should be only the first step ; doing so should not lead us to ignore the baseline risks that the tax system creates .
but , less obviously , these borrowers then demand more tax-induced lending from financial institutions , because tax benefits make their own use of debt cheaper . were their demand for debt lower – and , in the case of corporate debtors , were they to rely more on equity – financial institutions would face less pressure to use so much debt themselves .
much consideration has already been devoted to how to reform corporate taxation in a way that levels the playing field for equity relative to debt ; more than 20 years ago , the US Treasury conducted a major analysis and devised a plan to do so . as the Obama administration moves ahead with its new proposals , it should look back at the financial crisis , which provides strong grounds for implementing such a change .
one Flew Over the Resource Curse
Geneva – Geopolitical insight is often gained through real-life &amp; # 160 ; experience , rather than big-picture thinking . arriving at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris from Conakry , Guinea , is a case in point : Conakry ’ s airport , located in one of the world ’ s poorest countries , outperforms France ’ s prestigious global hub in terms of cleanliness , service , and pride .
by amplifying such exemplars into a national project , Guinea could join the small group of commodity-rich countries that have bucked the curse of corruption and economic decay that often accompanies large natural-resource endowments .
history demonstrates the difficulty of avoiding the so-called “ resource curse ” – and that it does not plague only less-developed countries like Nigeria , as many assume . in the 1980 ’ s , the United Kingdom ’ s North Sea-driven oil and gas boom undermined the country ’ s broad-based economic competitiveness , while Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ’ s government wasted much of the revenue on handouts that encouraged excessive consumption .
while a handful of commodity-rich countries have managed to buck the curse , including Botswana , Chile , and Norway , they have , nevertheless , failed to diversify their economies , remaining dependent on natural resource-based exports . but history is not destined to repeat itself , and leaders of commodity-rich countries are seeking alternative futures .
countries across Africa – including Ghana , Liberia , Mozambique , Rwanda , and Uganda – are showing early signs of success . Zambia recently issued a $ 750 million inaugural ten-year bond at an annual interest rate of 5.375 % .
such developments reflect growing confidence in Africa ’ s economic prospects and , thus , in its ability to escape the resource curse . but these countries still face significant obstacles to development .
first , governments must balance long-term goals with short-term achievements . given unlimited time , less-developed commodity-rich countries would first invest in human capital and institutions , then direct their growing commodity revenues into infrastructure , and move on to diversify their economies by strengthening the agriculture , manufacturing , and service sectors .
if governments fail to respond to these basic demands , citizens take to the streets , often destructively . this summer in Guinea , for example , citizens ’ frustration with widespread poverty and weak institutions , memories of ethnic persecution , and distrust of unfamiliar democratic processes fueled violent protests .
second , development requires both money and the right conditions . but , in many cases , the conditions placed on funding create barriers to investment .
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank lead the chorus of traditional players eager to help , offering debt write-offs and concessionary finance . but the stringent institutional reforms that they demand , while beneficial in theory , might not stabilize , let alone enhance , the development process .
newcomers , most notably China , have become a ready alternative source of cheap finance . but , in exchange , the Chinese expect business opportunities and , to some extent , political influence .
sovereign-wealth funds , too , are increasingly involved in financing development . but , despite being state-owned and subject to policy decisions , they function as commercial enterprises ( with the possible exception of Norway ’ s hydrocarbon-funded state-owned investment vehicles ) .
financing for the most expensive projects – implementing green-energy systems , building transport infrastructure , and developing modern cities – must come from foreign institutional investors . but high-quality private investors are resistant to financing lumpy , illiquid investments in fragile , volatile states .
as the most heavily invested , they have the most experience using cheap debt to create value . but , with commodity prices beginning to drop , even the most bullish companies are reassessing ambitious investment plans – a trend reflected in the Brazilian mining giant Vale ’ s recent decision to put its investment in Guinea on hold .
Bucking the resource curse requires , first and foremost , strong , legitimate domestic political leadership , underpinned by effective institutional arrangements . but it also requires a global investment community – public , private , and mixed – that can move beyond short-term thinking , ideological bias , ignorance , and cynicism .
Guinea , which is making progress despite annual per capita income of roughly $ 450 , exemplifies the potential of the world ’ s poorest countries to surpass expectations . investors should take note .
the Rules of Reconstruction
but Lebanon is not alone in that respect : according to the UN and several independent studies , countries in transition from war to peace face roughly a 50 % chance of sliding back into warfare . indeed , in East Timor , Iraq , Afghanistan , Kosovo , and many other countries , the transition to peace seems to be failing .
the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) , for example , just held its first elections in 40 years . the stability of the Great Lakes region of Africa , perhaps that continent ’ s most violent area , will depend on the success of its transition and reconstruction .
when wars end , countries confront a multi-pronged transition . violence must give way to security for inhabitants ; lawlessness and political exclusion must give way to the rule of law and participatory government ; ethnic , religious , or class / caste polarization must give way to national reconciliation ; and ruined war economies must be transformed into functioning market economies that enable ordinary people to support themselves .
these multiple tasks make economic reconstruction fundamentally different from “ development as usual . ” To succeed , the transition to peace requires demobilization , disarmament and reintegration of former combatants , as well as reconstruction and rehabilitation of services and infrastructure .
to meet these goals , the objective of peace should prevail over that of development if the two come into conflict . often , optimal economic policies and best practices are not attainable – or even desirable .
of course , the legitimacy of the government or other policymaking body will determine what is possible in economic policymaking . a weak interim national government – or a United Nations or foreign occupying administration – should not attempt to implement policies such as privatizing national resources when doing so might incite political resistance .
indeed , early privatization is likely to be destructive in its own terms , because property rights will remain in question for some time . thus , a new yardstick is needed to measure success .
effective demobilization and reconciliation in El Salvador , for example , ensured the consolidation of peace after that country ’ s brutal civil war of the 1980 ’ s . elsewhere , however , disregarding the primacy of politics in a transition to peace has had tragic consequences .
the failure to demobilize and reconcile factions in Lebanon , where Hezbollah remained armed despite its transformation into a political party , meant that belligerency was always bubbling below the surface . likewise , the collapse of peace processes in Angola and Haiti and the various setbacks in Cambodia and Nicaragua during the 1990 ’ s reflect a failure to demobilize and integrate .
on the surface , the UN seems ideally placed to lead reconstruction efforts because , unlike development institutions like the World Bank , it can integrate the political and economic objectives that are equal parts of a transition to peace . yet , time and again , the UN has shown itself to be incompetent in this role .
treating the transition to peace as “ development as usual ” has , moreover , led to new violence in East Timor , a country that the UN once trumpeted as a success story . the commercial exploitation of rich oil and gas reserves in the Timor Gap could have facilitated reconstruction and created jobs for the 30 % of the labor force that is unemployed .
Iraq provides numerous examples of the dangers created by misplaced priorities . early efforts to privatize Iraq ’ s oil industry proved disastrous , confirming for many Iraqis that the occupying Americans were determined to “ steal ” the country ’ s wealth and thus fanning the flames of violent resistance .
on the verge of civil war , Iraq just announced a restructuring of its foreign debt . rather than improving services and living conditions in areas where it could have helped consolidate peace , the government , at America ’ s behest , will allocate hundreds of millions of dollars to pay investment banks , accounting firms , and legal advisors who assist with that refinancing .
any transition to peace may well prove ephemeral unless policymakers make political reconciliation and integration – not optimal economic policies – the bedrock priority . despite its failures , the UN is probably still the best-placed organization to oversee such efforts .
the Russian Revival
Russia ’ s national revival and new assertiveness under President Vladimir Putin is not really home made but reflects highly auspicious international conditions . oil and gas prices are sky high , the United States is overwhelmed by serious problems in Iraq and the Middle East , and the West is divided about how it should deal with Russia .
Putin ’ s administration has been keen to take advantage of this favorable environment . yet , although some of the Kremlin ’ s moves seem clear and reasonable , others can scarcely be described as rational or forward-looking .
asserting itself as a major power outside the Western realm , Russia has boosted the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , which includes China and most Central Asian countries . indeed , Russia is increasingly attaching ever greater significance to its relations with China , something of a strategic shift in foreign policy , even if it is not yet clear how close Russia wants to be get to China .
Russia ’ s heavy-handed pressure on Georgia and its support of secessionist movements in South Ossetia and Abkhazia , two unrecognized republics within Georgia , inflames passions and risks destabilizing the already tense Northern Caucasus . should instability ignite into open warfare , Russia will find it impossible to avoid the consequences .
but if Russia ’ s policy toward him lets events in Georgia get out of control , Russia will be held accountable . because Russia claims the status of a world power , it is expected to show restraint and responsibility .
but the urge to project strength for the mere sake of doing so now seems overwhelming for the Kremlin . this urge stems from a desire to make up for the years of Russia ’ s humiliation after the USSR collapsed , years when the West contemptuously disregarded Russia ’ s views and interests .
this lingering resentment may explain Putin ’ s somewhat uncivil behavior and dubious jokes when dealing with his Western counterparts . it may also have been behind Russia ’ s irrational decision to renege on its promise to give Poland the files that document the massacre of thousands of Polish officers on Stalin ’ s orders in the forest at Katyn at the outbreak of WWII .
Russia needs America and the West in order to realize its ambitious initiative to establish international centers of uranium enrichment , and it needs Western markets , which are the largest consumers of Russia ’ s gas and oil . moreover , it is in the West where the rich and powerful Russian elite likes to travel , go shopping , and send their kids to school .
but Russia ’ s muscle-flexing behavior leaves Western leaders perplexed and wary , which seems a dubious way for the Kremlin to secure Russia ’ s new stature . contentious foreign policy makes contacts uneasy and agreements difficult to reach .
what will happen should crude strength and hard language prove inadequate to the task of insuring Russian national interests ? no one can say , but Russia ’ s history in this regard is not a source of hope .
managing Syria ’ s Meltdown
Syria , which at first seemed to be just another instance of internal change , has spawned a civil war that has spread beyond the country ’ s borders , affecting all of its neighbors . in historical terms , the Syrian crisis , not the Arab Spring , will most likely be regarded as the Middle East ’ s seminal event in this decade – and the crucible of the region ’ s future .
the dimensions of the crisis demand focus , wisdom , and leadership from all parties , especially the United States . managing the historical forces that are being released requires going far beyond the desultory US debate about what kind of assistance to give to which participants in the conflict .
would-be democrats , freedom fighters , jihadists , Sunni extremists , and Al Qaeda elements – all supported by Sunni Arab countries and groups , now man one side of the battle lines . against them are arrayed President Bashar al-Assad and his cronies , Shia militant groups fighting to protect their lifelines to Iran , religious minorities concerned about life after Assad , and , most ominously , Iran and its Lebanese proxy , Hezbollah .
with the stakes so high , the Russian-US initiative to organize a peace conference has not only been welcomed , but is seen as an indispensable initiative that must be planned with excruciating care . we are likely to hear of delay after delay in the coming days , as various sides try to choose their representatives .
the public debate in America about whether and how to arm or equip the Syrian opposition is an interesting sideshow . but it has nothing to do with the significance and complexity of the tectonic historical forces now grinding their way forward , straining – and beginning to tear asunder – the region ’ s political landscape .
Iran may be part of the problem , but , whether we like it or not , it may also be part of the solution . indeed , out of crisis can come opportunity : an Iranian role in resolving the Syrian conflict could bring a measure of cooperation that ultimately leads to progress in the moribund talks on Iran ’ s nuclear program .
but we also need to understand that Iran ’ s nuclear aspirations do not exist in a vacuum . they are part and parcel of a broader agenda , some elements of which are visible in the ongoing Syrian crisis .
the crisis has indeed spread to all of Syria ’ s neighbors – including , most recently , Turkey , which has witnessed the export of suicide bombings to what had been the peaceful city of Reyhanli . US President Barack Obama was wise to have invited Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , a NATO ally , to Washington for talks on Syria and the impending peace conference .
some pretend that the rise in violence there – to levels not seen since 2008 – has nothing to do with Syria . they lay all the blame for Iraq ’ s problems at the door of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki , a tough-minded Shia politician who has led the venerable Dawa Party to the head of a broad Shia coalition that helped him win a second term in December 2010 .
the Shia are the majority in Iraq , and the Sunnis need to become reconciled with that fact . there is certainly good reason to be concerned about Maliki ’ s temperament , his small group of advisers , his tendency to exercise personal control in the use of state power , and his reputation , partly merited , of making empty promises .
but Sunni extremists have launched some 50 suicide attacks in the last month , killing 500 mostly Shia civilians . in one instance , they killed 30 people and seized the Justice Ministry in downtown Baghdad , and have attacked Kurdish interests in Kirkuk and Mosul for good measure .
in other words , this is hardly a moment when any leader anywhere would be in a position to offer more concessions to the opposition . today , Sunnis in Iraq ’ s Anbar province , inspired by their brethren in neighboring Syria , are organizing “ tribal armies ” to do battle with the Iraq national army – a challenge to central authority that no leader could ignore .
the fate of the entire region may well depend on the outcome of the upcoming conference . for the US , in particular , this is a moment when many interests are simultaneously engaged .
the Science of Acupuncture
like many other traditional Chinese medicines , acupuncture has for many centuries been viewed suspiciously in the West . it seems to work , but how ?
most Chinese doctors and patients have , for example , long regarded acupuncture as an effective treatment for stroke , using it to improve motor , speech , and other functions that have been destroyed . one survey showed that 66 % of Chinese doctors use acupuncture routinely to treat the effects of stroke , with 63 % of the doctors surveyed believing it to be effective .
but another recent study done in the UK showed that research conducted in several countries was uniformly favorable to acupuncture as a treatment for the damage caused by stroke . indeed , all the trials performed before June 1995 in China , Japan , Hong Kong , and Taiwan were deemed positive by the British researchers .
the Cochrane Collaboration , an international non-profit organization providing healthcare information , conducted a systematic review of the benefits of acupuncture , including 14 trials , of which 10 were conducted in China , involving 1,208 patients . acupuncture started within 30 days of stroke onset , with control groups receiving a placebo – sham acupuncture – or no treatment .
indeed , another analysis , including 14 randomized trials with 1,213 patients six months after a stroke , compared the effects of conventional stroke rehabilitation with and without acupuncture as a supplement . acupuncture was found to have no additional effect on motor recovery , but a small positive effect on disability , which may be due to a true placebo effect , or to the varied quality of the trials .
only four trials , with 373 patients , could provide data on death or dependency ( becoming dependent on others for activities of daily living ) . and only three trials — all conducted in Europe — used sham acupuncture as a control , whereas no acupuncture trials controlled with placebos or sham acupuncture have been reported in China , owing to high cultural barriers .
after all , patients come to hospitals that practice traditional Chinese medicine because they already believe in acupuncture and are likely to be using it to treat another illness . getting such patients to accept being put into a control group where no acupuncture is applied is almost impossible .
more fundamentally , however , Chinese doctors who use traditional medicine argue that outcome measures of acupuncture as a treatment for stroke should be different from conventional measures used in Western trials , because the theory of acupuncture is different . but no one has yet specified what the appropriate outcome measures for acupuncture should be .
a recent study conducted in China , including 862 patients who were between the second and tenth day after onset of acute stroke , is the largest truly randomized trial using death or dependency as the primary outcome . the patients were randomly allocated to an acupuncture group receiving acupuncture treatment plus routine treatment or a control group receiving routine treatment alone .
we do know that acupuncture is a safe , inexpensive , widely accepted , and potentially effective therapy . particularly at a time when standard rehabilitation is not available for most Chinese stroke patients , few will wait to try acupuncture until its role is confirmed or refuted by reliable evidence .
the Scientific Road to Copenhagen
Berlin – On June 10 , 1859 , six months before Charles Darwin published his Origin of Species , the physicist John Tyndall demonstrated a remarkable series of experiments at the Royal Institution in London . the meeting was chaired by Prince Albert .
an orphan who was educated by monks , Fourier was a professor at the age of 18 , and became Napoleon ’ s governor in Egypt before returning to a career in science . in 1824 , Fourier discovered why our planet ’ s climate is so warm – tens of degrees warmer than a simple calculation of its energy balance would suggest .
one of these gases was CO2 . in 1859 , Tyndall described the greenhouse effect in beautifully concise words : “ The atmosphere admits of the entrance of solar heat , but checks its exit ; and the result is a tendency to accumulate heat at the surface of the planet . ”
then , in 1897 , Svante Arrhenius , who earned a Nobel Prize for chemistry six years later , calculated how much global warming a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere would cause . his answer was 4-6 degrees Celsius ( a little more than the 2-4 degrees that modern studies consistently find ) .
perhaps because he was Swedish , he proposed setting coal mines on fire to speed it up , since he thought a warmer climate was an excellent idea . but it was all just theory in Arrhenius ’ s time , since nobody had measurements to prove that CO2 levels in the atmosphere were in fact increasing .
that changed only in the late 1950 ’ s , when Charles Keeling started to measure CO2 with unprecedented accuracy in Antarctica and on Mauna Loa in Hawaii , far away from any sources . by 1960 , he was able to prove that CO2 was indeed on the rise .
it then took only a few years until , in 1965 , an expert report – the first of many – to US President Lyndon B. Johnson warned of global warming : “ By the year 2000 , the increase in carbon dioxide will be close to 25 % . this may be sufficient to produce measurable and perhaps marked changes in climate . ”
and even the rate at which emissions are increasing is now three times higher than in the 1990 ’ s . global temperatures had already risen by 0.5 ºC above preindustrial levels by the early 1990 ’ s , and another 0.3ºC have been added to that since the Rio Earth Summit .
but this has become an extremely tough challenge , as growth in greenhouse-gas emissions and atmospheric stocks accelerated in the years since Rio . that is why Copenhagen is so important : it may well be our last to address climate change before it addresses us .
Tyndall ’ s measurements 150 years ago showed that carbon dioxide traps heat and causes warming . and , 50 years ago , Keeling ’ s measurements showed that CO2 levels are increasing .
the Scoundrels of Economic Patriotism
Samuel Johnson called patriotism “ the last refuge of a scoundrel . ” If that is true , what should we think of today ’ s mounting economic nationalism , sometimes euphemistically described as “ economic patriotism ” ?
France is blocking the acquisition of French utilities by the Italian electricity company Enel . together with other European governments , France is also agitating against the takeover of the Luxembourg-based steel company Arcelor by a Netherlands company largely controlled by an Indian steel magnate .
an outraged Italian minister warned of a new mobilization of populist nationalism in an “ August 1914 ” scenario . the better analogy is from the 1930 ’ s : in 1933 , the year in which Hitler came to power , the world ’ s most famous economist , John Maynard Keynes , produced a plea for “ national self-sufficiency . ”
both the 1914 and the 1933 analogies point to the most striking characteristic of the current debate : the key role of security worries in justifying protectionism . nobody worried about foreign ownership of US ports as long as the owner was a British company ; the new fears reflect the belief that Dubai might be a channel for Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism .
likewise , the deterioration of international relations before World Wars I and II was marked by governments ’ increased propensity to use economics as a tool of power politics . in 1911 , the diplomatic crisis over Morocco was accompanied by a French speculative attack on German financial markets .
the most obvious reason for increased worries about security in America is the challenge of meeting the threat of terrorism after the attacks of September 2001 . but that can scarcely explain European nervousness and the protectionist reaction .
the first is that the new worries are a strange case of psychological transference . people in places like France and Poland who worry about national decline seek to blame somebody outside the country .
there was certainly a great deal of this type of sentiment in the 1930 ’ s , when the populist response to the Great Depression attributed it to the sinister forces of “ international capital . ” The modern version of this explanation holds that the world is changing so quickly that national security and , indeed , national identity , are under threat .
modern economic growth still depends in almost every advanced industrial country on imported energy ( Norway is an exception ) . because of fears about pollution , or about the safety of nuclear energy , most countries neglected to build up their own capacity .
the resulting vulnerability was highlighted by the Russian reduction of gas supplies to Ukraine in January , which resulted in reduced flows to central and western Europe . the experience made Poles particularly jittery , and pushed the country ’ s populist right-wing government down the road of economic nationalism .
these two scenarios of the origins of economic nationalism , one irrational and the other not , are not real alternatives , but describe responses that intertwine : the more rational the fear , the more that fear can be used as an instrument of politics .
politicians like this because it increases demand for their services . they point out the potential problem and then attempt to sell solutions that lie within their nationally defined spheres of competence .
one modern politician , in particular , has been effective in placing nervousness about energy supply at the center of a new political vision . according to Vladimir Putin , the need to control and secure energy justifies a massive extension of state intervention in the economy .
Putin ’ s vision was apparently vindicated by the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the US . since then , Putin has projected his vision of politicized energy in a way that makes all Europeans , not just Russians , nervous .
we should be concerned about the efficiency losses in markets where restrictions stemming from economic nationalism have so far been imposed . but we should be far more worried that fear about the collapse or manipulation of markets creates a demand for action that makes such a collapse more rather than less likely .
the Search for Quality on the Web
twenty years ago , they could graduate from high school without ever using a computer . in only a few decades , amp # 160 ; computer technology and the Internet have transformed the core principles of information , knowledge , and education .
indeed , today you can fit more books on the hard disk of your laptop computer than in a bookstore carrying 60,000 titles . the number of Web pages on the Internet is rumored to have exceeded 500 billion , enough to fill 10 modern aircraft carriers with the equivalent number of 500-page , one-pound books .
such analogies help us visualize the immensity of the information explosion and ratify the concerns that come with it . Web search engines are the only mechanism with which to navigate this avalanche of information , so they should not be mistaken for an optional accessory , one of the buttons to play with , or a tool to locate the nearest pizza store .
it shaped a new generation of people who are strikingly different from their parents . baby boomers might be the best placed to appreciate this , since they experienced Rock &apos; n ’ Roll as kids and Google as parents .
but search technologies that are based on statistical algorithms cannot address the quality of information , simply because high-quality information is not always popular , and popular information is not always high-quality . you can collect statistics until the cows come home , but you cannot expect statistics to produce an effect beyond what they are good for .
they need time for people to make referrals , and time to collect them . therefore , new publications and dynamic pages that change their content frequently are already beyond the scope of the popularity methods , and searching this material is vulnerable to rudimentary techniques of manipulation .
for example , the inefficiencies of today ’ s search engines have created a new industry called Search Engine Optimization , which focuses on strategies to make Web pages rank high against the popularity criteria of Google-esque search engines . it is a billion-dollar industry .
information quality , molded in the shadow of Web search , will determine the future of mankind , but ensuring quality will require a revolutionary approach , a technological breakthrough beyond statistics.amp # 160 ; This revolution is underway , and it is called semantic technology .
for example , when a computer encounters the word “ bill , ” it would know that “ bill ” has 15 different meanings in English . when the computer encounters the phrase “ killed the bill , ” it would deduce that “ bill ” can only be a proposed law submitted to a legislature , and that “ kill ” could mean only “ stop . ”
by contrast , “ kill bill ” would only be the title of the movie by that name . at the end , a series of deductions like these would handle entire sentences and paragraphs to yield an accurate text-meaning representation .
ontology is neither a dictionary nor a thesaurus . it is a map of interconnected concepts and word senses that reflect relationships such as those that exist between the concepts of “ bill ” and “ kill . ”
building an ontology encapsulating the world ’ s knowledge may be an immense task , requiring an effort comparable to compiling a large encyclopedia and the expertise to build it , but it is feasible . several start-up companies around the world , like Hakia , Cognition Search , and Lexxe , have taken on this challenge .
the answer is simple : precision . once computers can handle natural languages with semantic precision , high-quality information will not need to become popular before it reaches the end user , unlike what is required by Web search today .
semantic technology promises other means of assuring quality , by detecting the richness and coherence of the concepts encountered in a given text . if the text includes a phrase like “ Bush killed the last bill in the Senate , ” amp # 160 ; does the rest of the text include coherent concepts ?
given humans ’ limited reading speed ( 200-300 words per minute ) and the enormous volume of available information , effective decision-making today calls for semantic technology in every aspect of knowledge refinement . we cannot afford a future in which knowledge is at the mercy of popularity and money .
the Second Coming of Barack Obama
Washington , DC – The race was tough , but US President Barack Obama has won re-election . the question now , for the United States and the world , is what will he do with a fresh four-year term ?
many leaders – Nicolas Sarkozy , Gordon Brown , and José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero come to mind – have been swept away by economic discontent in recent years . although the financial disaster erupted on George W. Bush ’ s watch , after eight years of a Republican presidency , Obama had to carry the burden of an anemic recovery .
moreover , America ’ s ongoing demographic transformation makes it harder for candidates who are unable to reach out strongly to Latinos and other minority communities – something that Romney singularly failed to do – to carry the country .
some aspects of the campaign , particularly the amount of money spent and its negative tone , struck many observers as objectionable . but the competitiveness of American democracy – the fact that an alternative always exists , and that those in power have to fight hard to stay there – was on admirable display for the whole world to see .
in the US , the uneven and weak recovery has been sustained by extraordinarily expansive monetary policies and ongoing large fiscal deficits . while corporate coffers hold mountains of cash , private investment stagnates .
likewise , Europe is on life support , thanks to European Central Bank President Mario Draghi ’ s astute maneuvering and promises of unlimited intervention in sovereign-debt markets . but unemployment is at its highest in decades and growth has essentially stalled , even in Germany , while the troubled southern economies are mired in deep recession .
the world ’ s emerging-market economies are in better shape ; but , while their underlying trend growth in potential output is much higher than that of the advanced economies , there is no cyclical de-coupling . the world economy is an interdependent whole : trouble in any important part of it is transmitted globally .
the US cannot determine the world economy ’ s future on its own , but the course taken by America nonetheless has huge global importance , given that it remains the largest economy and retains considerable influence in venues such as the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , and the G-20 . American ideas continue to affect the policy debate worldwide .
despite the difficulties facing the global economy , there are huge investible resources in the US , China , Germany , and elsewhere . while there are climate and resource constraints , we are still at the beginning of a technological revolution that holds tremendous potential for higher productivity and greater prosperity , along with challenging implications for labor and employment .
but sustainable economic growth requires that those with investible resources actually invest them . and that will not happen unless and until a broad-based recovery of the middle- and lower-income groups in advanced economies , including the US , delivers the prolonged rebound in demand for which investors are waiting .
in other words , a more balanced income distribution is not only a social or ethical issue ; it is crucial for macroeconomic and , indeed , long-term corporate success . this is vital for many countries , above all the US and China .
without the skills required by new and incipient technologies , too many workers will simply be unemployable . a key benefit of prioritizing broad-based quality education is that it also helps to solve the income-distribution problem .
finally , there is the need for effective international cooperation . China ’ s current-account surplus has declined , but now northern Europe runs a $ 500 billion surplus , while demand in southern Europe is collapsing and the US is running a deficit that is close to $ 500 billion .
after America ’ s long , hard-fought election campaign , it is time for comprehensive policy reforms . one hopes that the US Congress will recognize this as well , leading to support for measures that could help hundreds of millions of people in the US and around the world .
the Secret of Harvard ’ s Success
AHMEDABAD , INDIA – No country dominates any industry as much as the United States dominates higher education . according to Shanghai Jiao-Tong University ’ s Academic Ranking of World Universities , for example , 17 of the world ’ s 20 best universities are American , with Harvard topping the list by a substantial margin .
the traditional explanation for this phenomenon – America ’ s wealth , large population , generous research funding , widespread private philanthropy , and ability to attract scholars from around the world – is incomplete . although the US boasts the world ’ s largest economy , it comprises only one-quarter of global GDP , and possesses roughly one-twentieth of the world ’ s population .
moreover , according to the accepted explanation , large countries such as France , Germany , Japan , and even China and India should also be represented at the top of global university rankings . but they appear only sparsely anywhere in such rankings , if even at all .
in fact , these countries lack a crucial piece of the puzzle : America ’ s innovative governance model for higher education .
Harvard was established as a public institution in 1636 by the authorities of the Massachusetts Bay Colony . its value to Massachusetts is exemplified in the Commonwealth ’ s post-independence state constitution , ratified in 1780 , which includes a section about the university ’ s function and boundaries .
when Harvard alumni dominated the Massachusetts legislature , the university was given support and consideration . but , in the 1840 ’ s , mass immigration , fueled by the Irish potato famine , altered the state ’ s demographic balance , enabling populists to gain control of the legislature .
over the next two decades , the state increasingly impeded Harvard ’ s functioning by , for example , refusing to release funds and obstructing the appointment of professors . this behavior culminated in 1862 , when the legislature blocked a university president ’ s appointment .
today , 19 of the top 20 American universities in US News and World Report ’ s much-watched rankings are controlled by alumni ( defined as 50 % or more representation on the Board of Trustees ) . the only exception , the California Institute of Technology , has a board with 40 % alumni representation .
in general , a higher percentage of alumni on the board is associated with a higher ranking , increased selectivity , and a larger endowment . after all , no group cares more about a university ’ s prestige than its alumni , who gain or lose esteem as their alma mater ’ s ranking rises or falls .
indeed , alumni have the most incentive to donate generously , and to manage the university effectively . given their intimate knowledge of the university , alumni are also the most effective leaders .
but US universities found a way to integrate competition ’ s benefits into the European concept of nonprofit , or so-called eleemosynary , corporations . the lack of profit does not diminish an alumni-dominated board ’ s incentive to compete for prestige by , for example , hiring distinguished faculty , accepting meritorious students , and striving for athletic or artistic achievement .
using alumni to infuse the benefits of competition into nonprofit institutions exemplifies the genius of American adaptation . countries that aspire to compete with US universities should take note .
the Secret Policeman ’ s Fall
as Hungary ’ s Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany found out when a recorded admission that his government was lying incited riots , openness in government doesn ’ t come easily in Eastern Europe ’ s new democracies . like Hungary , post-communist Romania has struggled to increase transparency and honesty in what was once one of the world ’ s most closed societies .
indictments have been issued against former and current cabinet ministers , members of parliament , judges , prosecutors , lawyers , police and customs officers , and other public officials , as well as directors of private companies . in addition , new standardized forms have been introduced for declarations of assets and financial interests by anyone who holds an official position in government , parliament , public and local administration , and the judicial system .
but getting access to sensitive information in transitional democracies is not always easier , as I know from my previous work as a human rights lawyer with the Romanian Helsinki Committee . often we had to go to court to force disclosure of information , using Romania ’ s 2001 Freedom of Information Act .
we filed a civil action against the prosecutor , and the judge imposed a fine for every day the information was withheld . but it was only when we caught the media ’ s attention that the data – detailing the number of wiretaps authorized over the previous 10 years , against whom , and for how long – were released .
but when painful reforms are necessary , there is no alternative . we could not have achieved the economic and political reforms that qualified us for EU membership if we had not subjected policymaking to public scrutiny and accepted the increased public participation in decision-making that inevitably accompanies such openness .
indeed , this has become a sine qua non of democratic government throughout the world . when the United States adopted its Freedom of Information Act in 1966 , it joined the exclusive company of Sweden and Finland .
likewise , the Bucharest court was asked for the number of judges disciplined since the beginning of 2000 , including grounds for any sanctions applied . the Court transferred the request to the Superior Council of Magistrates , which provided a full response : a four-page list of all sanctioned judges , with details of the reasons and penalties .
but , in the former communist bloc , the benefits brought by transparency have been undeniable . at the same time , Romania ’ s experience demonstrates that official secrecy remains a threat to the core values of democratic governance , and that only constant vigilance , in both established and young democracies , can prevent its encroachment .
the Seven-Year Ditch
Princeton – There are historical precedents for sovereign-debt defaults by the countries of Europe ’ s southern periphery , but they are not instantly attractive ones . dealing with seemingly intractable problems often takes time .
in August 1982 , Mexico threatened to default , and was quickly followed by other large borrowers , notably Argentina and Brazil . a default contagion would have brought down the banking systems of all the major industrial countries , and caused the world to relive something like the financial crisis of the Great Depression .
what followed was a seven-year play for extra time . the initial approach was to link policy improvements in the borrowing countries not only with help from international institutions , but also with additional lending from the banks – which seemed to defy the most elementary canons of sensible bank behavior .
three years after the outbreak of the Latin American crisis , United States Treasury Secretary James Baker announced a systematization of the initial response . it was not very imaginative : banks and multilateral development institutions should all lend more , and the debtors should continue their efforts to improve their macroeconomic policies .
more than three years passed before new US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady set out a more satisfactory program , in which banks would be given a menu of options that included lower interest rates on the debt and a hefty discount on the principal . if creditor banks were unwilling to accept some form of restructuring , they would have to put in new money .
Brady ’ s plan looked like a great success . confidence returned , capital flight from Latin America was reversed , and capital markets became willing to provide financing again .
inevitably , the Brady Plan looks like a good model for southern Europe . why not avoid seven years of misery , and begin some similar rescue operation now that could lead to a return to economic vigor and dynamism ?
the most obvious answer is that at an earlier stage in the Latin American saga , the banks simply could not have afforded to take such losses on their capital . they needed to fake it for seven years in order to build up adequate reserves against losses .
the initiative for the Brady Plan did not come from the official sector at all . it was the willingness of some large financial institutions to trade in discounted debt that established a market that could clear out the legacy of past mistakes .
their CEOs at the time presented their actions as being motivated by far-sighted benevolence and a concern for the well-being of the world as a whole . that may have been plausible , but the two banks also wanted to demonstrate publicly that they had better balance sheets than their weaker rivals .
moreover , despite the obvious “ reform fatigue ” of Latin American electorates , the debtor countries had engaged in a substantial measure of reform . before the Brady Plan was announced , Mexico had accepted a wide-ranging Pact of Economic Solidarity and Growth , which immediately improve investor confidence and reduced sky-high domestic interest rates .
one of the problems that had made the crisis more difficult after 1982 was the US dollar ’ s appreciation . likewise , today ’ s euro crisis is harder to resolve because of the euro ’ s strength in currency markets .
on all fronts , there has not been much progress . there is certainly plenty of frustration about the implementation of austerity , and no real indication of the long-term sustainability of reform efforts in southern Europe .
a truly competitive European banking system would provide incentives for the larger and stronger banks to take more risks in the hope of growing even larger and stronger . but , in the aftermath of the financial crisis , policymakers are too pre-occupied by the real problems posed by too-big-to-fail banks , and too terrified by the potential collapse of weaker banks , to allow such a solution .
the euro ’ s strength , despite the magnitude of the eurozone ’ s difficulties , makes an export-led recovery strategy harder to realize . the common currency ’ s strength reflects problems elsewhere in the world , but a euro exchange rate that would enable the return of confidence and growth is no less elusive for that .
without the preconditions that made the Brady Plan work , simply transplanting a debt write-off would only augment uncertainty and fuel the political revulsion that already threatens to undermine European integration . and it may be that Europe – because of its relative prosperity – is less in a mood for the biblical seven lean years than was a much poorer Latin America in the 1980 ’ s .
the Shadow of Depression
in both cases , if either Europe or Japan returned – or , indeed , ever returns – to something like the pre-downturn trend of economic growth , it took ( or will take ) decades . in a third case , Europe at the end of the 1930 ’ s , we do not know what would have happened had Europe not become a battlefield following Nazi Germany ’ s invasion of Poland .
of course , in the absence of mobilization for WWII , it is possible and even likely that the Great Depression would have cast a shadow on post-1940 US economic growth . that is certainly how things looked , with high levels of structural unemployment and a below-trend capital stock , at the end of the 1930 ’ s , before mobilization and the European and Pacific wars began in earnest .
in the US , we can already see signs that the downturn that started in 2008 is casting its shadow on the future . reputable forecasters – both private and public – have been revising down their estimates of America ’ s potential long-run GDP .
for example , labor-force participation , which usually stops falling and starts rising after the business-cycle trough , has been steadily declining over the past two and a half years . at least some monetary policymakers believe that recent reductions in the US unemployment rate , which have largely resulted from falling labor-force participation , are just as valid a reason for shifting to more austere policies as reductions in unemployment that reflect increases in employment .
most important , however , has been what looks , from today ’ s perspective , like a permanent collapse in the risk-bearing capacity of the private marketplace , and a permanent and large increase in the perceived riskiness of financial assets worldwide – and of the businesses whose cash flows underpin them .
sometime over the next generation , the price levels of the US , Japan , and Germany might rise substantially after some government short-sightedly attempts to finance some of its social-welfare spending by printing money . the price levels are unlikely to go down .
there are no psychological preferences , natural-resource constraints , or technological factors that make investing in private enterprises riskier than it was five years ago . rather , the risk stems from governments ’ refusal , when push comes to shove , to match aggregate demand to aggregate supply in order to prevent mass unemployment .
managing aggregate demand is governments ’ job . while Say ’ s law – the view that supply creates its own demand – is false in theory , it is true enough in practice that entrepreneurs and enterprises can and do depend on it .
for 62 years , from 1945-2007 , with some sharp but temporary and regionalized interruptions , entrepreneurs and enterprisers could bet that the demand would be there if they created the supply . this played a significant role in setting the stage for the two fastest generations of global economic growth the world has ever seen .
the Silver Lining in High Commodity Prices
the United States ’ ill-considered bio-fuels subsidy program demonstrates how not to react . rather than acknowledge that high fuel prices are the best way to inspire energy conservation and innovation , the Bush administration has instituted huge subsidies to American farmers to grow grains for bio-fuel production .
moreover , even under the most optimistic scenario , the US and the world will still be relying mainly on conventional fossil fuels until the hydrocarbon era comes to an end ( which few of us will live to see ) . last but not least , diverting vast tracts of agricultural land into fuel production has contributed to a doubling of prices for wheat and other grains .
the gas tax should be raised , not lowered . the sad fact is that by keeping oil prices high , OPEC is doing far more for environmental conservation than Western politicians who seek to prolong the era of ecologically unsustainable Western consumerism .
prices for many commodities have doubled over the past couple of years . oil prices have risen almost 400 % in the last five years . the proximate cause is a global economic boom that has been stronger , longer , and more broad-based than any in modern history .
Asia has led the way , but the past five years have been the best Latin American and Africa have enjoyed in decades . broad-based commodity shortages often begin to emerge at the end of long global expansions , and in this respect , the present boom is no different .
if “ speculators ” are bidding up today ’ s commodity prices because they realize that future generations are going to want commodities , too , isn ’ t that a healthy development ? high prices for commodities today mean more supply for future generations , while at the same time creating an incentive to develop new ways to conserve on consumption .
admittedly , the global commodity price boom has had profound , albeit enormously complex and uncertain , effects on poverty . while surging commodity prices are helping poor farmers and poor resource-rich countries , they are a catastrophe for the urban poor , some of whom spend 50 % or more of their income on food .
the World Bank , the United Nations , and even the Bush administration have moved to help , albeit in small measure relative to the scale of the problem . of course , it should be noted that if economic reform in resource-rich Africa had been proceeding at the same pace as in Asia , the era of soaring commodity prices might have been postponed for another century .
true , when today ’ s global economic boom ends , as it inevitably will , commodity prices will plummet , easily 25 % , quite possibly 50 % or more . Western politicians will cheer , and many pundits will express relief that less money will be flowing to undemocratic countries in the developing world .
but today ’ s era of high commodity prices is not just a bad dream that should be forgotten when it ends . high prices send a real message about scarcity in a globalizing world .
the Sinai Powder Keg
Tel AVIV – The crisis in the Sinai Peninsula seems to have been dwarfed by Sunday ’ s drama in Cairo . but Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi ’ s civilian coup , in which he dismissed General Mohamed Hussein Tantawi , the leader of the army ’ s supreme command , has not diminished the importance of the trouble there .
one vehicle failed to break through the border crossing ; the other penetrated Israeli territory , before being stopped by the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) . in response , Egypt ’ s military and security forces launched an offensive against Bedouin militants in Sinai , while Morsi forced the General Intelligence Service ’ s director to retire and dismissed the governor of Northern Sinai .
these episodes highlight the complexity of the Middle East ’ s changing geopolitical landscape , the fragility of Egypt ’ s post-Mubarak political order , and the explosive potential of Sinai , which , though sparsely populated , includes Egypt ’ s borders with Israel and the Palestinian enclave of Gaza . indeed , since Hosni Mubarak ’ s ouster last year , security in Sinai has deteriorated , and the region has become fertile ground for Islamic extremism .
the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty mandated that Sinai be largely demilitarized in order to serve as a buffer zone between the two former enemies . tourism and natural-gas pipelines linking the two countries provided economic resources for the local Bedouin .
but , as Mubarak ’ s regime declined , so did the government ’ s control over the Bedouin . Palestinian militants from Gaza – an active arena of Israeli-Palestinian confrontation since Hamas gained control in 2007 – and jihadi terrorists affiliated with Al Qaeda and the larger “ global jihad ” network penetrated Sinai , exploiting the government ’ s neglect of the region and inflaming the local population ’ s feelings of disenfranchisement .
Israelis complained about Mubarak ’ s “ cold peace , ” but they appreciated that he adhered to the treaty ’ s fundamental provisions . now the behavior of his successors from the military and the Muslim Brotherhood has revived security challenges and raised difficult questions about the region ’ s future .
their objective was to damage further the Israeli-Egyptian relationship , which is already more fragile than ever , and they succeeded : the IDF accidentally killed several Egyptian soldiers during the incident . the Egyptian security forces ’ subsequent failure to prevent demonstrators from storming Israel ’ s embassy in Cairo brought matters to the brink of calamity .
the uncertainty and disorder that have plagued Egypt for the last 18 months are fueling increasing lawlessness in Sinai . last month , a pipeline carrying Egyptian natural gas to Israel and Jordan was bombed – the 15th such attack since Mubarak ’ s regime was toppled – and remains out of commission .
Israel wants , first and foremost , peace and stability . to this end , Israeli leaders expect Egypt ’ s government to reestablish its authority in Sinai , and , despite the peace treaty ’ s provisions , have agreed to Egyptian requests to increase its military presence in the region .
Israel is determined not to act against terrorist groups and infrastructure on Egypt ’ s territory . and , in view of Hamas ’ s close links with Egypt ’ s Muslim Brotherhood , whose political party backed Morsi ’ s successful presidential run , Israel has restrained its response to terrorist and rocket attacks from Gaza .
relations with Israel are managed by the defense minister , now Lieutenant General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi , and the military security establishment , whose leaders are determined to maintain a peaceful relationship with Israel and to secure Egyptian sovereignty in the Sinai . for them , the lawless Bedouin , the Sinai jihadis , and Hamas and other groups in Gaza threaten Egypt ’ s national security .
meanwhile , Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood are playing a double game . while Morsi denounced the recent violence ( particularly the deliberate killing of Egyptian policemen ) and issued an implicit threat against Hamas , the Brotherhood published a statement accusing Israel ’ s Mossad of perpetrating the attack – a claim that Hamas ’ s Prime Minister of Gaza , Ismael Haniyeh , has repeated .
having lost Syrian backing , it is hoping that the Egyptian Brothers will provide its kindred movement with political and logistical support . yet it allows radical Palestinians and jihadi groups in Gaza to conduct operations in Sinai .
the fourth actor , the Sinai jihadis , comprises primarily Bedouins , whose distinct origins and long-time marginalization have led some to identify with radical Islamist groups ( often while working in the Arabian Peninsula ) . while this group ’ s primary goal is to undermine Israel-Egypt relations , they do not shy away from operating directly against the Egyptian state .
but it is too early to tell whether its security crackdown in Sinai is a one-time operation , intended to placate angry citizens , or the beginning of a serious effort to address the interconnected problems in Sinai and Gaza . it is also too early to tell whether Morsi ’ s shakeup in Cairo was related to , or expedited by , the Sinai events .
Hamas and the Bedouins in Sinai have most likely been emboldened by the latest developments in Cairo . but , as Egypt ’ s domestic politics take their course , Israel , which has had to tread softly in its relationship with Egypt and in Sinai since January 2011 , will have to behave with even greater sensitivity in the days ahead .
the Single Mother Makeover
Murphy Brown , played by actress Candice Bergen , was a TV anomaly at that time : a sympathetically portrayed single mother . so Bush ’ s vice president , Dan Quayle , attacked the show for normalizing rather than stigmatizing single motherhood .
the implication was that selfish me-first feminists ( if they were affluent white women ) or feckless social parasites ( if they were low-income women of color ) were putting their own interests above their children ’ s . Daniel Patrick Moynihan ’ s widely reprinted study The Negro Family : the Case for National Action painted a picture of single motherhood as the primary instigator of inner-city and especially African-American criminality , illiteracy , and drug use .
( Europe has more single mothers than the US , but , characteristically , has less need to moralize about them one way or the other ) . in US pop culture , the single mother has evolved from selfish yuppie or drug-dazed slut into a woman who is more fun , slightly more heroic , and certainly less frumpy than her married counterpart .
indeed , single mothers are the new maternal ideal – women whose maternal drive is so selfless and intense that they choose to raise children even under the burden of their solitary status .
Angelina Jolie ’ s photo spread with her toddler son , adopted from Cambodia , in Vanity Fair heralded this shift : the sexy young woman and her son in a luxurious hotel bedroom made single motherhood look fun and glamorous .
the tale of Sarah Palin ’ s daughter , Bristol , has also been spun as a tale of an admirable single mother and a loser father . when they split up , the story line cast the heroic young mother against what was often depicted as the beer-drinking , immature dad .
even Jennifer Aniston , whom Brad Pitt left because she did not want kids , now sighs in interviews , as she nears 42 , that she has stopped waiting for Prince Charming , and that she , too , could be ready to adopt and go it alone .
likewise , advertisements for convenience food and insurance – which used to feature only intact nuclear families – have begun to showcase single mothers lovingly spooning out meatballs , or protectively buying a life-insurance policy .
the glorification of single mothers represents a collective exasperation on the part of women in America – and women who make decisions in the mainstream media . the 1990 ’ s produced a demeaning narrative of women waiting in frustration as their “ biological clocks ” ticked , cursing themselves for putting career first at the expense of finding Mr. Right and having children .
the message from the media was one of constant nagging and blame , such as the famous Newsweek cover that asserted ( wrongly ) that an older single woman had more likelihood of being in a terrorist attack than of finding a husband . the whole narrative , as the writer Susan Faludi correctly perceived , was not about marriage at all ; it reflected a backlash against feminism .
at some point , women became powerful enough that they collectively rejected the high social value this narrative placed on a male offer of a ring and flipped the stereotype on its head . it started to occur to women that they could be employed and have a family – and that it could even be pretty nice .
this trend hardly signifies the end of civilization as we know it ; all things being equal , most women would still prefer the simple fantasy of a supportive partner in childrearing . but the new image of single mothers – and of single motherhood – does show that it is getting harder – if not almost impossible – to coerce women by trying to fix upon them the scarlet letter .
nationalism , Madness , and Terrorism
Boston – If we want to understand what drove the Boston Marathon bombing suspects , Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , to terrorism , the answer almost certainly does not lie in Dagestan , where the brothers lived before moving to the United States , or in the two wars fought in Chechnya in the last 20 years . instead , a key to the Tsarnaevs ’ behavior may perhaps be found in developments in England 500 years ago .
several new phenomena appeared in sixteenth-century England that revolutionized human experience . English society was redefined as a “ nation ” – that is , a sovereign community of equal members .
at the same time , a special variety of mental illness was first observed , which we would later call schizophrenia and depressive disorders – different from a multitude of mental illnesses already known . it called into being a new term , “ madness , ” the first medical specialization ( eventually named “ psychiatry ” ) , and special legislation regarding the “ mad . ”
madness expressed itself in degrees of mental impairment , the common symptoms of which were chronic discomfort in one ’ s environment ( social maladjustment ) , uncertainty about oneself , oscillation between self-loathing and megalomania , and sometimes a complete loss of identity . suicide became common , and the nature of violent crime changed , with a new type – irrational and unconnected to self-interest – becoming increasingly prevalent .
these phenomena were connected . it was nationalism that legitimated mobility ; the two of them together that produced madness ; and the new mental disease that expressed itself in suicide and irrational violence .
nationalism implied a specific image of society and reality in general – a consciousness that was to become the cultural framework of modernity . in its original , English , form it was essentially democratic .
by considering a living community sovereign , nationalism implicitly but drastically reduced the relevance of God ; even when combined with religion and presented in a religious idiom , it was essentially secular . national consciousness , dramatically different from the fundamentally religious , hierarchical consciousness that it replaced , shapes how we live today .
nationalist principles emphasize the self-governing individual , including the right to choose one ’ s social position and identity . but this liberty , empowering and encouraging the individual to choose what to be , complicates identity formation .
a member of a nation cannot learn who or what s / he is from the environment , as would an individual in a religious and rigidly stratified social order , in which everyone ’ s position and behavior is defined by birth and divine providence . modern culture cannot provide us with the consistent guidance that other cultures give to their members .
because a clear sense of identity is a necessary condition for adequate mental functioning , malformation of identity leads to discomfort with one ’ s self and social maladjustment , reaching clinical proportions among the more fragile of us . that is why the addition of madness to the roster of familiar mental illnesses coincided with the emergence of nationalism .
that is why the most open and freest society today , the Unites States , leads the world in rates of severe mental disease – supplanting England , yesterday ’ s freest and most open society . indeed , foreigners at one time considered madness “ the English malady . ”
most examples of violent crime by mentally ill people were committed first in England , and then in the US , often seeming politically motivated , even when mediated by religion . the first such case was likely that of Peter Berchet , a young Protestant , who felt that he had to kill the royal councilor Christopher Hatton , also a Protestant , whom Berchet believed to be a Catholic sympathizer .
to all appearances the act of a Puritan fanatic , the authorities suspected Berchet of being a part of an organized Puritan conspiracy . he was to be questioned to divulge the names of his co-conspirators and then executed .
it was as natural for an Elizabethan Protestant to see the cause of his mental discomfort in a government overrun by Catholic sympathizers as it is for someone with a Muslim connection in the US today to see this cause in America as the embodiment of Western offenses against the faith .
a story is constructed , which rationalizes one ’ s discomfort as reflecting an awareness of some general evil . one may then join an organization committed to fighting that evil or be impelled to act on one ’ s own – to the point of committing murder .
the thinking behind such acts bears the most distinctive mark of delusion : the loss of the understanding of the symbolic nature of human reality , confusing symbols and their referents , and seeing people in terms of what they represent .
the Slave Ethos and the African Economy
DAKAR – The slump in prices for Africa ’ s natural resources , which led to chronic deficits in the past , has been reversed . consumption , fueled by huge Asian demand for African commodities , is on the rise across the continent .
Africa is estimated to hold more than 10 % of global oil reserves and one-third of reserves of cobalt and base metals . South Africa alone possesses 40 % of the world ’ s gold , which has been skyrocketing in value since the onset of the global financial crisis .
long-term global demand for Africa ’ s commodities , land , and manpower is unlikely to diminish . China , which has increased trade with Africa five-fold since 2003 , has played a leading role in this turnaround , which has encouraged investors from elsewhere , including Europe and the United States , to rethink their approach to investing in Africa .
unfortunately , however , while the direction of Africa ’ s trade may be changing , its composition – raw-material exports and manufactured imports – is not .
in the half-century since colonialism ended ( for the most part ) , sub-Saharan Africa has experienced many false dawns . one remembers the 1960 ’ s , when the global economy ’ s “ long boom ” gave Africa a chance to save its surpluses , invest in value-added industries , and increase productivity .
hundreds of years ago , many African kings effectively engaged with the West ’ s rising imperial powers to halt the growth of indigenous industry in pre-colonial Africa . instead of having their peoples begin to manufacture their own goods , these rulers chose to import them from Europe in exchange for their own subjects – or the subjects of neighboring rulers – whom they exported as slaves .
back then , imported goods consisted mainly of beads , alcohol , and , most importantly , weapons , which enabled these rulers to exercise extreme violence over their people . it was a system that no doubt worked to the benefit of Africa ’ s partners .
when slavery was abolished in the mid-nineteenth century , the terms of these rulers ’ partnership with Western colonizers changed from trade in slaves to trade in commodities . after independence in the early 1960 ’ s , during the Cold War , many African rulers played the West against the Soviet bloc to retain their predatory economies .
elite networks continue to conspire with foreign interests to cannibalize their economies and retain the perquisites of power : fleets of luxury cars , private jets , bank accounts in tax havens , overseas properties , consumer goods , weaponry , etc . their contempt for local products extends to health and education : rather than invest in these vital sectors , Africa ’ s rulers use private overseas healthcare and schools for themselves and their children .
this culture of exploiting Africa ’ s human and natural resources at will – not through entrepreneurial endeavor and wealth creation , but by means of predatory politics – is deeply entrenched . indeed , the few trade unionists , intellectuals , and others who challenge these regimes usually do not seek to change how the state functions , but rather to ensure that , as they put it , they get their “ turn to eat . ”
not so . if a few NGOs have achieved great results fighting the ills of Africa ’ s poor , the vast majority are perceived as either a “ fifth column ” of the West or a refuge for fringe members of the elite who use widespread poverty as another source of lucre .
according to estimates published in the Financial Times on June 1st , at least $ 854 billion ( € 702.6 billion ) have been siphoned from Africa since 1970 in cumulative capital flight . however , this cost is nothing compared to the scars associated with Africans being seen around the world as the “ wretched of the earth . ”
at the turn of the millennium , a meeting of African church leaders convened on the Senegalese island of Gorée to urge Africans to assess their share of responsibility for the slave trade . the call went unheeded , in keeping with the general atmosphere of self-denial surrounding the issue .
Africa faces a crisis of leadership and governance , owing to a dysfunctional ethos . if Africans want to change this , they cannot spare themselves a collective debate about their elites ’ complicity in widespread impoverishment .
the Sleeping Volcano of Global Finance
the rejection of the European Union ’ s Constitutional Treaty by French and Dutch voters was , according to all evidence , more a rejection of unregulated globalization than it was a rejection of Europe . the general instability of social relations – most importantly , but not only , of employment – is slowly becoming intolerable for a growing part of the population in many developed countries , not just in Europe .
capitalism could be reconstructed after World War II because it was buttressed by three necessary types of regulation : social security , which served as a principal stabilizer , at least in the developed countries ; Keynesian tools to fight domestic cyclical downturns ; and a universal high-wage policy aimed at stimulating general consumption , without which the genius of capitalism – mass production – does not work .
but the realignment of the rich , developed countries around the monetarist policies promoted by economists like Milton Friedman , which began around 1970 , broke with all that . not long after , the dollar was detached from the gold standard .
employment is increasingly precariousness . and where unemployment is preferred to universal job insecurity , it has become impossible to suppress .
it is to this state of affairs that the French and Dutch said “ no ” two months ago .
after all , beyond the social misery produced by the re-institutionalized cruelty of the current global economic system , the greatest danger facing the world nowadays is that very system ’ s inherent instability . I don ’ t see any institution other than the EU that has enough size and heft to protect Europeans from a possible implosion .
consider the simple fact that the American economy is now more than $ 600 billion in debt . the United States cannot function without being able to borrow $ 1.9 billion dollars each and every day of the year , mainly from the emerging economies of Asia , and China above all .
but this support could weaken or even cease if the dollar falls too low , if the price of oil rises too high , or if the American economy backfires . in fact , the US economy has become increasingly detached from reality .
meanwhile , two speculative bubbles – in the real estate market and in mortgages – have become grafted upon each other and now dominate economic activity in the US . a crash , or at least a sharp spasm , is quite likely in the near future , and the consequences – for America and the world – may be catastrophic .
this instability also makes it difficult to address other grave problems affecting the global financial system . sovereign debt , needed by all countries , but particularly by the poorest , suffers profoundly from erratic interest-rate and exchange-rate movements .
to make matters worse , national failures can no longer be addressed without aggravating the situation . of course – indeed , above all – in such circumstances the immense investments needed to overcome underdevelopment and the disabilities that it entails are increasingly forgotten by the world of international finance .
with rich countries threatened by instability and poor countries largely left to their own devices , the reconstruction of the world financial system should be at the top of the international agenda . a new Bretton Woods could not be more urgent !
five Years in Limbo
new YORK – When the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008 , triggering the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression , a broad consensus about what caused the crisis seemed to emerge . a bloated and dysfunctional financial system had misallocated capital and , rather than managing risk , had actually created it .
five years later , while some are congratulating themselves on avoiding another depression , no one in Europe or the United States can claim that prosperity has returned . the European Union is just emerging from a double-dip ( and in some countries a triple-dip ) recession , and some member states are in depression .
labor-force participation in the US has fallen to levels not seen since women began entering the labor market in large numbers . most Americans ’ income and wealth are below their levels long before the crisis .
yes , we have done some things to improve financial markets . there have been some increases in capital requirements – but far short of what is needed .
Market-dominant banks still extract hefty fees on debit- and credit-card transactions from merchants , who are forced to pay a multiple of what a truly competitive market would bear . these are , quite simply , taxes , with the revenues enriching private coffers rather than serving public purposes .
but here , too , what they have paid is but a fraction of the losses that their actions caused . more important , the underlying problem – a perverse incentive system whereby they are paid by the firms that they rate – has yet to change .
but they never seem to mention that anyone who got huge government loans with near-zero interest rates could have made billions simply by lending that money back to the government . nor do they mention the costs imposed on the rest of the economy – a cumulative output loss in Europe and the US that is well in excess of $ 5 trillion .
yes , we were all Keynesians – but all too briefly . fiscal stimulus was replaced by austerity , with predictable – and predicted – adverse effects on economic performance .
and an economy in which 25 % of workers ( and 50 % of young people ) are unemployed – as is the case in Greece and Spain – is still in depression . austerity has failed , and there is no prospect of a return to full employment any time soon ( not surprisingly , prospects for America , with its milder version of austerity , are better ) .
the financial system may be more stable than it was five years ago , but that is a low bar – back then , it was teetering on the edge of a precipice . those in government and the financial sector who congratulate themselves on banks ’ return to profitability and mild – though hard-won – regulatory improvements should focus on what still needs to be done .
exceptions Become the Rule
new YORK – Long ago , I worked as an analyst on Wall Street . the first company that I analyzed was Federal Express , which at the time had not yet shipped its first package .
the idea behind FedEx was simple and compelling : the cost of complexity was higher than the cost of air transport , so the company would ship all its packages overnight to Memphis , Tennessee . by radically simplifying the myriad combinations of start and end points – the only routes were to and from Memphis – all of the packages could be delivered the next day reliably .
indeed , with the ability to make reliable predictions , we can put people and things into categories , whether market segments , disease risks , likely loan defaulters , potential purchasers , and so on . that ’ s big data .
the exceptions – whether individual genotypes , individual privacy preferences , or digital rights to use content in specific contexts – &amp; # 160 ; have become the rule . we don ’ t need to guess at everyone ’ s privacy preferences or settle for one-size-fits-all policies .
over time , we will be able to figure out which people , based on their genotype , will be helped or harmed by a particular drug , or how children can learn best with personalized feedback , or how to produce furniture and clothing in a world of 3D printers and real-time modeling . and so on .
people who care about something will be able to specify their preferences to an extremely precise degree and get exactly what they want . for others , actually setting those preferences or defining what they want may take more attention than they care to devote to the task .
but this change will raise challenging social and political questions as well , particularly concerning privacy preferences and health care – both already controversial issues .
currently , Web advertisers and publishers say that their businesses depend on their ability to track people and collect and resell the data that they gather . they argue , further , that it is too complicated to respect individuals ’ preferences , too difficult to tell them how their data is being used , and pointless to treat them as individuals .
yet , somehow , the data collectors can manage to record individuals ’ purchase histories , their airline seat preferences , and so on . there is no reason why they could not also record how and by whom each piece of such information can be used .
indeed , millions of people now do set specific privacy preferences within Facebook , opt out of being tracked , and the like . at the same time , they gladly share data with vendors and even track their own data – whether airline mileage or steps walked , check-ins at their favorite venues ( especially if they can earn discounts or special offers ) , or their movie , music , or book purchases .
most people would not care , but those who did would appreciate the transparency and perhaps want a little share . suppose you started a business that managed data on behalf of the users .
that is not such a crazy idea – the airlines , among other companies , are already doing it to some extent . United , American , and British Airways all know my travel patterns on their airlines , and help me manage both my past trips ( and related rewards ) and my future reservations .
businesses can treat customers as individuals , and give them the amount of special consideration that they are willing to pay for . companies can also decide not to serve certain customers , focusing on the most profitable segments .
but this approach does not work for things that the government ( that is , other people ’ s taxes ) pays for . in the public sector , the one-size-fits-all approach still prevails .
but consider all of the qualitative services and conditions for which individuals have different preferences , needs , and outcomes that are now more predictable . if we can predict individual outcomes , what is an individual ’ s responsibility , and what remains a collective task ?
for example , we treat children differently in school according to their potential – as we understand it . but , if we help some children “ to realize their potential , ” are we thereby limiting the potential of others ?
likewise , how do we allocate health-care resources ? what responsibility do individuals have to modify their behavior in response to their individual vulnerabilities and predispositions ?
the Social Dimensions of Globalization
the war on terrorism and in Iraq has distracted much of the world &apos;s attention from the pressing issue of how globalization should be managed so that it benefits everyone . a new report , issued by the International Labor Organization &apos;s Commission on the Social Dimensions of Globalization , reminds us how far the Bush administration is out of line with the global consensus .
the gap between the emerging consensus on globalization , which this report reflects , and the Bush administration &apos;s international economic policies help explain today &apos;s widespread hostility towards America &apos;s government .
consider two issues that have been part of recent bilateral trade agreements pushed aggressively by the Bush administration . the crises in East Asia and the recent recessions in Latin America show that premature capital market liberalization can result in enormous economic volatility , increasing poverty , and destruction of the middle class .
even the IMF now recognizes that capital market liberalization has delivered neither growth nor stability to many developing countries . yet , whether driven by narrow ideology or responding to the demands of special interests , the Bush administration is still demanding an extreme form of such liberalization in its bilateral trade agreements .
the second issue concerns the unbalanced intellectual property provisions ( TRIPs ) of the Uruguay Round of trade talks , dictated by America &apos;s pharmaceutical and entertainment industries . these provisions restricted countries from making generic imitations of drugs , making many critically important medicines unaffordable in developing countries .
spearheaded by worries about AIDS , activists around the world demanded that something be done . just before last year &apos;s trade talks in Cancun , the US made some concessions , so that it was no longer the only holdout .
the global consensus , reflected in the Commission report , calls for more exceptions , so that , say , drugs can be made available in any case where to do so could save a life . to those confronting the prospect of death , what matters is access to life-saving drugs , not whether what is killing the person is part of an epidemic .
bilateral agreements form the basis of enhanced ties of friendship between countries . but America &apos;s intransigence in this area is sparking protests in countries facing the &quot; threat &quot; of such an agreement , such as Morocco , and is forming the basis of long-lasting resentment .
the Commission highlights other issues that have received insufficient global attention - such as tax competition among developing countries , which shifts more of the tax burden from business to workers . in still other areas , the Commission &apos;s report argues for more &quot; balanced &quot; perspectives .
as this example shows , bringing different voices to the table in discussions of globalization brings new perspectives . until now , the main worry for most experts on globalization has been excessive government intervention in the economy .
at the root of this problem is the global political system - if such it can be called . key players like the IMF and World Bank must become more transparent and their voting structures must be changed to reflect the current distribution of economic power - as opposed to that prevailing in 1945 - let alone to reflect basic democratic principles .
whatever one thinks of the many concrete suggestions made by the Commission , this much is clear : we need a more inclusive debate about globalization , one in which more voices are heard , and in which there is more focus on the social dimensions of globalization . this is a message the world would do well to heed , lest discontent with globalization continue to grow .
the Efficient Networker
just last week , a friend pulled me aside at a conference to ask for advice . “ What ’ s the best way to make conferences more efficient for meeting people ? ” he asked .
he was asking the wrong question . the interaction has to be two-way : do other people really want to meet him ?
indeed , does my friend have a right to their time ? he told me that he had actually sat in a breakout group with 20 people , each of whom he wanted to meet , but he managed to talk to only two of them .
what he wanted was a tool that would allow him to make contact with each person on the list of people he had picked out . this is probably a legitimate goal – he sells decent products – but the reality of the world is that relationships , even around so-called shared interests , are not necessarily symmetrical .
more people want to meet Bill Gates or Marissa Mayer than vice versa . if we were to create a real market , it would become unpleasantly commercial – a bit like those charity auctions where celebrities or tycoons donate the pleasure of their company for lunch with the highest bidder , except that the VIP pockets the money .
at yet another conference , I was musing about how to make introductions efficient but not transactional when I was introduced to Lisa Anderson of Werqit by Megan Smith of Google . that was a useful signal .
in other words , the behavior her startup looks for is not purchasing behavior ( like so many “ social ” tools ) , but actual social behavior . Werqit plans to build a “ collaboration graph ” by looking not only at ability to help or collaborate , but also at indicators of willingness .
willingness reflects a complex mix of incentives influencing when , whom , and how to help – and also reflects how busy a potential ally or target is . ( as in any market , you need to consider not just your targets , but also who is competing with you for their attention . )
the premise is that willingness to help is influenced not just by connections , but also by the kind of connections and by the requester ’ s ability to formulate a clear and specific request . clearly , Werqit is both a flattering compliment ( and complement ! ) to LinkedIn and a competitor for what LinkedIn does only in part .
currently , Werqit relies on what it can glean from public data and the user ’ s own Facebook , Twitter , and LinkedIn interactions . over time , it will develop its own database of users .
this is the first new tool that I have come across whose creators seem to understand that the problem is not simply to find the right people ; it is to run the right process to succeed at a specific task with the help of those people .
consider my own interaction with Anderson . I frequently advise people who approach me without an introduction that they should start with someone who knows them , not with a stranger they would like to know .
maybe my friend was lucky to speak with only two of the 20 people in his breakout group . as Werqit ’ s Anderson knows , the most effective introductions are those made by others .
the Soft Power of the United Nations
Joseph Stalin once dismissed the relevance of “ soft power ” by asking , “ How many troops does the Pope have ? ” Today , many self-styled realists dismiss the United Nations as powerless , and argue that it can be ignored .
with no forces of its own and a relatively tiny budget , the UN has only as much hard power as it can borrow from its member states . it was created in 1945 to be the servant of its member states , and Article 2.7 of its charter protects the sovereign jurisdiction of its members .
after the failure of the League of Nations in the 1930 ’ s , the UN was designed to have the Security Council ’ s permanent members act as policemen to enforce collective security . when the great powers agreed , the UN had impressive hard power , as demonstrated in the Korean War and the first Gulf War .
people do not live wholly by the word , but neither do they live solely by the sword . for example , the UN could not prevent the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , but the absence of its imprimatur greatly raised the costs to the American and British governments .
some American leaders then tried to de-legitimize the UN and called for an alternative alliance of democracies . but they missed the point : Iraq policy had divided allied democracies , and , with its universal membership , the UN remained an important source of legitimacy in the eyes of most of the world .
for example , in recent years the internal bloc politics among its member states produced a Human Rights Council with little interest in fair procedures or the advance of human rights . likewise , administrative inefficiency has led to poor performance of high-profile efforts like the oil-for-food program .
in the aftermath of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon War , states turned once again to UN peacekeepers , as they have in dealing with the problems in the Congo and Darfur . but , while there are currently more than 100,000 troops from various nations serving in UN peacekeeping missions around the world , member states are not providing adequate resources , training , and equipment .
for example , in the aftermath of the recent government crackdown in Myanmar ( Burma ) , the Secretary General was able to send a representative to the country , but with powers limited to reporting and attempted mediation . that may be enough to influence some governments , but the Burmese junta recently expelled the UN ’ s representative after he warned of “ a deteriorating humanitarian situation . ”
it has modest but useful soft power when great powers disagree but are willing to acquiesce in a course of action . and it has very little power when the great powers oppose an action , or repressive member governments ignore the claims of the new “ responsibility to protect . ”
the Soft Underbelly of China ’ s Growth
China ’ s explosive economic growth hinges on the rest of the world , radically changing the global production chain and challenging the global trading system . if China maintains its growth momentum over the next two decades , the global system will face huge challenges .
in fact , even as China ’ s economy has boomed over the past decade , structural adjustment in its domestic sectors slowed , mainly owing to political constraints . the banking system remains unhealthy and fragile ; capital markets are dying .
the private sector ’ s growth is hemmed in by its inability to invest in economic sectors that the government still monopolizes . mounting regional disparities , as well as the widening urban-rural divide , impede household consumption growth , increasing the economy ’ s dependence on exports and foreign investment .
now , it is laying the groundwork to become a global power in more sophisticated , technology-intensive industries . billions of dollars are flowing into auto , steel , chemical , and high-tech electronics plants , setting the stage for China to be a major exporter of high-end products .
postponing structural reforms eventually constrains any economy ’ s performance , as we saw in Japan in the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s . China has similar problems , with the investment-growth nexus threatening macroeconomic stability – witness the overheating that occurred in 2003 and 2004 .
indeed , China faces tremendous challenges in maintaining macroeconomic stability under conditions of export-led growth , with huge repercussions for the rest of the world . given China ’ s size and its rising share in the global market , macroeconomic instability there fuels volatility in global prices for basic commodities and raw materials .
but the political reality is that China ’ s government favors rapid growth in the short run over the structural reforms needed to sustain long-term economic performance . fiscal consolidation and the abrupt closure and restructuring of inefficient banks and state enterprises would , after all , constitute a powerful brake on short-term growth , threatening social peace and political stability .
this may explain the growing efforts of Chinese businesses in recent years to go global themselves . globalization is increasingly viewed as an alternative to domestic structural complexity .
this strategy will exact a heavy price , just as it did in Japan twenty years ago . the main lesson of Japan ’ s approach is that launching an aggressive buying spree overseas merely upsets established international balances of interests – thus generating greater tensions with the rest of the world – while hiding the seriousness of structural problems at home .
focusing squarely on structural reforms would allay some of the fears that China ’ s rise has inspired in the rest of the world , while winning praise from the international business community . rather than scaring global corporations and their home states , China would retain strong political support abroad – and the financing that it needs for its continued development .
in economic terms , China has no choice : it must remove the structural obstacles that stand in the way of rapid growth over the next decade or two . above all , truly secure and sustainable economic development requires that it build a large consumer base at home .
of course , the global imbalances associated with China ’ s economic rise can take longer to adjust than they otherwise would , simply because the US welcomes it as being in America ’ s own interest . but China ’ s long-term interest , and that of the world , requires that it get serious about domestic structural reform .
the Software of Life
in the accepted classification of sciences , mathematics is thought to be the queen , and the most difficult to grasp , followed by physics , chemistry , and , finally , biology . but this scientific hierarchy is false and misleading : we now know that biology contains more mathematics than we ever imagined .
when molecules entered the scientific understanding of life with the discovery of DNA , biology climbed one step up the scale , to chemistry . then , with recognition of the abstract schemas dictating how genes are expressed , biology climbed even closer to mathematics .
for a long time , those who studied the nature of life and heredity were divided into two camps : epigeneticists , who emphasized environmental influences on living organisms , and preformists , who stressed the similarities between parents and progeny . the epigeneticist view was clearly wrong , because something stable had to be transmitted across generations .
consider the old metaphysical puzzle : is a wooden boat whose planks are gradually replaced as they decay the same boat after all the planks have been changed ? “ Systems ” biology is biology that recognizes that what remains the same is the design of the boat – that which determines the relationships between the planks .
when computer programming became widespread , pieces of software were found to behave the same way , and were thus called “ viruses . ” And when it became possible to manipulate DNA in vitro , the metaphor of a “ genetic program ” appeared even more precise : scientists could construct experiments that corresponded to the reprogramming of cells merely by working on symbols in silicon .
the metaphor comes from the famous mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing , who , along with John von Neumann and other theoreticians , uncovered the link between the mathematics of whole numbers and logic . Turing proposed that all computations and logical operations could be performed by a simple machine , which he called the Universal Turing Machine , reading and modifying a linear sequence of symbols .
genetic engineering rests on the manipulation of DNA molecules ( whether real or artificially constructed ) in order to reprogram foreign cells . as a result , many bacteria today produce human proteins .
it has been shown that , the outcome of some computer programs is at once entirely deterministic , innovative , and unpredictable . the computer metaphor thus implies that living organisms are material systems that , facing an unforeseeable future , arrive at improbable solutions so that some of their progeny can survive in unpredictable conditions .
however , the metaphor is limited by a simple fact : computers do not make computers . the challenge for the new biology is to understand how they would .
the Sources of Chinese Conduct
Beijing – Six decades ago , the American diplomat George Kennan wrote an article , “ The Sources of SovietConduct , ” that galvanized American and world opinion , which soon hardened into the rigid postures of the Cold War . today , given China ’ s decisive influence on the global economy , and its increasing ability to project military power , understanding the sources of Chinese conduct has become a central issue in international relations .
since 2008 , discussions among Chinese scholars and strategists on the nature of their country ’ s foreign policy have focused on two issues : its ideological foundations , and China ’ s international appeal and standing – its “ soft power . ”
mainstream thinking , known as the Chinese School , insists , with the government , on “ Marxism with Chinese characteristics ” as the bedrock principle of China ’ s foreign policy . but a minority school argues that China should rely instead on the country ’ s traditional political thought , emphasizing the universal value of traditional Chinese philosophy .
the Chinese School insists on adhering to Deng Xiaoping ’ s doctrine of maintaining a low profile in international diplomacy , while the traditionalist group advocates taking on greater international responsibility . the mainstream school defines China as a developing country , pointing to China ’ s per capita GDP , which ranks only 104th in the world .
today , the impact of the Chinese School seems to be limited mostly to official statements , while the traditionalists are gradually gaining policy influence . for example , the Chinese government reiterated its core diplomatic principle of non-intervention in other countries ’ affairs during the Libya crisis , yet China accepted the imposition of United Nations ’ sanctions on Muammar Qaddafi ’ s government .
moreover , China dispatched a warship and four military aircraft to the Mediterranean to help evacuate 35,860 Chinese nationals and 2,100 others from Libya . that measure , the first projection of Chinese naval power so far from home , is consistent with Confucianism , which regards morality as the top priority of policymaking , rather than Marxism , according to which economic interests alone drive foreign policy .
early Confucian thinkers were writing in a world of small countries competing ruthlessly for territorial advantage . for them , the key to international power was political power , and the central attribute of political power was a morally informed leadership .
thus , thinkers such as Mencius , Confucius ’ s leading intellectual heir , argued that humane authorities should punish immoral rulers in other states who tyrannize their people . rulers who rely mostly on military or economic might divorced from morality , he argued , cannot achieve long-term success on the international stage .
at the recently concluded 11th People ’ s National Congress , the word heard most often in policy discussions was “ happiness , ” which had suddenly replaced “ economic growth ” as the official mantra . this change may augur future adjustments in China ’ s foreign policy as well , for “ happiness ” is a word used more frequently in Chinese traditional political thought than in Marxist political philosophy .
according to early Confucian thinkers , a key task for rulers is to strive to improve a peoples ’ happiness , which is itself grounded in a moral way of life . because poverty was an obstacle to moral behavior , they believed that the state should be vitally concerned with eliminating it .
in February 2010 , at “ Spring Festival ” – one of China ’ s biggest holidays , marked by family reunions – Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said that the government should help people live with dignity and happiness . at a press conference this month , he said that economic reform cannot succeed without political reform , and that corruption currently poses the gravest danger to China .
such statements sounded new to Chinese ears , because they accentuated politics rather than trumpeting the Party ’ s usual emphasis on economic determinism .
today , it is impossible to tell what impact and how much influence Chinese traditional political thought – the traditional concern with moral duty , happiness , and honor – will have on China ’ s foreign policy . but it is certain that the influence of traditional ideas in Chinese public life is growing .
US Interest Rates Will Continue to Rise
Cambridge – Six months ago , I wrote that long-term interest rates in the United States would rise , causing bond prices to fall by so much that an investor who owned ten-year Treasury bonds would lose more from the decline in the value of the bond than he would gain from the difference between the bonds ’ interest rate and the interest rates on short-term money funds or bank deposits .
that warning has already proved to be correct . the interest rate on ten-year Treasury bonds has risen almost a full percentage point since February , to 2.72 % , implying a loss of nearly 10 % in the price of the bond .
given the current expected inflation rate of 2 % , the real rate on ten-year bonds is still less than 1 % . past experience implies that the real rate will rise to at least 2 % , taking the total nominal interest rate to more than 4 % , even if expected inflation remains at just 2 % .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke ’ s announcement in May that the Fed would soon start reducing its asset purchases and end QE in 2014 caused long-term interest rates to jump immediately . although Bernanke ’ s announcement has focused markets on exactly when this “ tapering ” will begin and how rapidly it will proceed , these decisions will not affect the increased level of rates a year or two from now .
with the unemployment rate currently at 7.4 % – having fallen nearly a full percentage point in the last 12 months – markets can anticipate that the 6.5 % threshold could be reached in 2014 . and the prospect of rising short-term rates means that investors no longer need to hold long-term bonds to achieve a higher return over the next several years .
although it is difficult to anticipate how high long-term interest rates will eventually rise , the large budget deficit and the rising level of the national debt suggest that the real rate will be higher than 2 % . a higher rate of expected inflation would also cause the total nominal rate to be greater than 5 % .
the interest rate on ten-year Treasuries increased from about 4 % in the mid-1960 ’ s to 8 % in the mid-1970 ’ s and 10 % in the mid-1980 ’ s . it was only at the end of the 1970 ’ s that the Fed , under its new chairman , Paul Volcker , tightened monetary policy and caused inflation to fall .
it may therefore be tempting to invest in inflation-indexed bonds , which adjust both principal and interest payments to offset the effects of changes in price growth . but the protection against inflation does not prevent a loss of value if real interest rates rise , depressing the value of the bonds .
the relatively low interest rates on both short-term and long-term bonds are now causing both individual investors and institutional fund managers to assume duration risk and credit-quality risk in the hope of achieving higher returns . that was the same risk strategy that preceded the financial crisis in 2008 .
the Specter of Global Stagflation
new York – Will rising global inflation lead to a sharp global economic slowdown ? even worse , will it revive stagflation , that deadly combination of rising inflation and negative growth ?
in emerging markets , inflation has – so far – been associated with growth , even economic overheating . but economic contraction in the US and other advanced economies may lead to a growth recoupling – rather than decoupling – in emerging markets , as the US contraction slows growth and rising inflation forces monetary authorities to tighten monetary and credit policies .
today , a stagflationary shock may result from an Israeli attack against Iran ’ s nuclear facilities . this geopolitical risk mounted in recent weeks as Israel has grown alarmed about Iran ’ s intentions . such an attack would trigger sharp increases in oil prices – to well above $ 200 a barrel .
but short of such a negative supply-side shock , is global stagflation possible ? between 2004-2006 global growth was robust while inflation was low , owing to a positive global supply shock – the increase in productivity and productive capacity of China , India and emerging markets .
this positive supply-side shock was followed – starting in 2006 – by a positive global demand shock : fast growth in “ Chindia ” and other emerging markets started to put pressure on the prices of a variety of commodities . strong global growth in 2007 marked the beginning of a rise in global inflation , a phenomenon that , with some caveats ( the sharp slowdown in the US and some advanced economies ) , continued into 2008 .
barring a true negative supply-side shock , global stagflation is thus unlikely . recent rises in oil , energy and other commodity prices reflect a variety of factors :
large current-account surpluses and / or rising terms of trade imply that the equilibrium real exchange rate ( the relative price of foreign to domestic goods ) has appreciated in countries like China and Russia . thus , over time the actual real exchange rate needs to converge – via real appreciation – with the stronger equilibrium rate .
following a benign period of a positive global supply shock , a positive global demand shock has led to global overheating and rising inflationary pressures . now the worries are about a stagflationary supply shock – say , a war with Iran – coupled with a deflationary demand shock as housing bubbles go bust .
thus , central banks in many advanced and emerging economies are facing a nightmare scenario , in which they simultaneously must tighten monetary policy ( to fight inflation ) and ease it ( to reduce the downside risks to growth ) . as inflation and growth risks combine in varied and complex ways in different economies , it will be very difficult for central bankers to juggle these contradictory imperatives .
the Spring of the Zombies
new York – As spring comes to America , optimists are seeing “ green sprouts ” of recovery from the financial crisis and recession . the world is far different from what it was last spring , when the Bush administration was once again claiming to see “ light at the end of the tunnel . ”
but that does not mean that the global economy is set for a robust recovery any time soon . hitting bottom is no reason to abandon the strong measures that have been taken to revive the global economy .
that model has broken down , and will not be replaced soon . for , even if America ’ s banks were healthy , household wealth has been devastated , and Americans were borrowing and consuming on the assumption that house prices would rise forever .
the collapse of credit made matters worse ; and firms , facing high borrowing costs and declining markets , responded quickly , cutting back inventories . orders dropped abruptly – well out of proportion to the decline in GDP – and those countries that depended on investment goods and durables ( expenditures that could be postponed ) were particularly hard hit .
we are likely to see a recovery in some of these areas from the bottoms reached at the end of 2008 and the beginning of this year . but examine the fundamentals : in America , real estate prices continue to fall , millions of homes are underwater , with the value of mortgages exceeding the market price , and unemployment is increasing , with hundreds of thousands reaching the end of their 39 weeks of unemployment insurance .
the banking system has just been tested to see if it is adequately capitalized – a “ stress ” test that involved no stress – and some couldn ’ t pass muster . but , rather than welcoming the opportunity to recapitalize , perhaps with government help , the banks seem to prefer a Japanese-style response : we will muddle through .
loan debacle of the 1980 ’ s. the banks are using bad accounting ( they were allowed , for example , to keep impaired assets on their books without writing them down , on the fiction that they might be held to maturity and somehow turn healthy ) . worse still , they are being allowed to borrow cheaply from the United States Federal Reserve , on the basis of poor collateral , and simultaneously to take risky positions .
some of the banks did report earnings in the first quarter of this year , mostly based on accounting legerdemain and trading profits ( read : speculation ) . but thiswon ’ t get the economy going again quickly .
the American government , too , is betting on muddling through : the Fed ’ s measures and government guarantees mean that banks have access to low-cost funds , and lending rates are high . if nothing nasty happens – losses on mortgages , commercial real estate , business loans , and credit cards – the banks might just be able to make it through without another crisis .
but experiences around the world suggest that this is a risky outlook . even &amp; nbsp ; were banks healthy , the deleveraging process and the associated loss of wealth means that , more likely than not , the economy will be weak .
Eastern Europe has its problems , which are likely to impact Western Europe ’ s highly leveraged banks . in a globalized world , problems in one part of the system quickly reverberate elsewhere .
in earlier crises , as in East Asia a decade ago , recovery was quick , because the affected countries could export their way to renewed prosperity . but this is a synchronous global downturn .
America ’ s strategy for fixing its financial system is costly and unfair , for it is rewarding the people who caused the economic mess . but there is an alternative that essentially means playing by the rules of a normal market economy : a debt-for-equity swap .
with such a swap , confidence could be restored to the banking system , and lending could be reignited with little or no cost to the taxpayer . it ’ s neither particularly complicated nor novel .
the question is how long and deep this downturn will be . in spite of some spring sprouts , we should prepare for another dark winter : it ’ s time for Plan B in bank restructuring and another dose of Keynesian medicine .
autumn of the Patriarchs
Francisco Franco is reputed to have exclaimed on his deathbed . death , it seems , is always particularly difficult for autocrats to manage , even when they succeed in dying of natural causes .
a dictator ’ s death throes are always a form of theater , featuring ecstatic masses , would-be successors fighting for political survival , and , behind the scenes , the dictator ’ s coterie locked in efforts to extend the life of their patriarch until they can secure their privileges . Franco ’ s son-in-law , who was also the family doctor , kept the dying despot on life-support machines for more than a month .
the emotional manipulation of the mise-en-scene surrounding Chávez ’ s death appears certain to translate into electoral support for his grey successor , Nicolás Maduro . but will this suffice to create a Chávista lineage ?
Fernández ’ s melodramatic speeches are a transparent attempt to elevate her late husband to saintly status , just as Perón elevated his wife , Evita , to sainthood . upon taking office , she swore allegiance not only to the constitution , but to “ Him ” ( Kirchner ) as well .
after Augustus , the first Roman princeps , the Senate could vote deceased emperors into divine status . such an apotheosis , of course , served the political interests of the emperor ’ s successors , who could claim a godly lineage while aspiring to be raised to godlike status themselves .
an ordinary , natural death does not accord with the superhero image of the patriarch fighting the nation ’ s enemies . Maduro ’ s conspiracy theory that his mentor ’ s cancer was the result of poisoning by “ the dark forces that wanted him out of the way ” is not particularly original , though it does raise the stakes .
given the bizarre circumstances of Stalin ’ s own death , was he poisoned by his secret police chief , Lavrentiy Beria , or perhaps by his archenemy , Yugoslavia ’ s Josip Broz Tito ? did “ Dear Leader ” Kim Jong-il suffer a heart attack in bed , or , more nobly , on a train trip while working for the welfare of his beloved people ?
he could just as well refer to Egypt ’ s Gamal Abdel Nasser , who dropped dead of a heart attack in 1970 ; Nasser ’ s confidant , the journalist Mohamed Hassanein Heikal , always maintained that the president had been poisoned by his deputy and successor , Anwar El Sadat .
although Chávez ’ s legend may survive , Chávismo probably will not , for it is not truly a doctrine , but a sentiment based on the rejection of the old political order and the invention of enemies . it lacks the solid foundations of , say , Perónism , an inclusive movement that relied on a traditionally well-organized working class and a nationalistic bourgeoisie .
the Stem-Cell Race Continues
scientific research is usually conducted to improve our lives , but it is also an industry , one that represents a massive investment by governments and corporations alike . the stakes and potential rewards for a few research topics are exceptionally high , which is why the recent finding that the Korean scientist Hwang Woo-suk fabricated the results of his work on stem cells has reverberated so widely .
the episode highlights the ongoing race in global health research that is playing out in the field of stem cells . possibly one of the biggest prizes in medical history is up for grabs , and anyone – truly anyone – could seize it .
that study was initiated by the United States , which used insights developed in the wake of the atomic bombing of Japan to understand the extent of long-term genetic damage . the current research effort on stem cells and their potential is just as grand , because it will lead to an equally radical medical revolution .
whereas a skin cell or a liver cell , for instance , can reproduce only more skin or liver , stem cells , which are the most robust at the beginning of human development , are “ master ” cells . as a fertilized egg turns into an embryo , and then a fetus , those initial stem cells somehow show their daughter cells how to become skin , liver , eye , or bone .
in these cases , stem cells would be encouraged to restore nerve tissue . this would also benefit patients with brain and spinal injuries , or those who have suffered strokes and paralysis .
a stem cell changes its identity through a process of “ triggering ” – a signal literally “ turns on ” the liver cell gene inside the stem version . when scientists figure out how to flip these switches , it might be possible to introduce stem cells into the body and activate them so that they correctly replace damaged tissue , whatever it is .
not surprisingly , given its huge potential , teams of scientists have been mobilized almost everywhere for embryonic stem cell research . the race has become all the more dramatic since the leading researcher , the US , dropped out , owing to the influence of religion on politics ( although the state of California has decided not to miss out , and recently approved a $ 3 billion subsidy for embryonic stem cell research ) .
because the promise is so great , and the science does not require massive infrastructure , many smaller countries have rushed to take advantage of the absence of the US . any competent medical research center can enter the race , whether in Mexico , Ethiopia , Indonesia or Yemen .
discoveries occur incrementally , and , because it is science , each step is announced and tested . research establishments gain momentum this way , with the leaders sweeping up talent , resources , and prestige in a rough-and-tumble intellectual ecology .
they claimed that they had developed a technique whereby new , perfect stem cells could be cloned from ordinary ones . this was big news , for it implied that sufficient numbers of stem cells could be made without controversy , thus allowing anyone to be able to do quality research while avoiding what US President George W. Bush described as “ taking a life to save a life . ”
more importantly , the Koreans did a common thing these days : they claimed patent rights over the process . it almost looked for a moment as though South Korea would become a world superpower in health matters .
we now know that the Seoul researchers made up the whole thing . an investigation by a Seoul National University investigative panel has concluded that the “ cloned ” stem cells were really created by test-tube fertilizations .
the fraud has bewildered the science community , particularly because the claim that the Korean researchers made was so transparently false . why , then , did they place their reputations and careers in jeopardy ?
with stem cell research , huge fortunes depend on which group takes the lead , wherever their laboratory is located . as the competition heats up , we should expect amazing developments – and no doubt more public relations gimmicks .
the Stimulus Ostriches
as N. Gregory Mankiw said of a stimulus package back in 2003 , when he was President George W. Bush &apos;s chief economic advisor , this is not rocket science . deficit spending in a recession , he said , “ help &#91; s &#93; maintain the aggregate demand for goods and services .
I can understand ( though I disagree with ) opponents of the stimulus plan who believe that the situation is not that dire ; that the government spending will be slow and wasteful ( whereas properly targeted tax cuts would provide a more effective stimulus ) ; and thus that it would have been better to defeat Obama ’ s stimulus bill and try again in a couple of months .
I can also understand ( though I disagree with ) opponents who believe that the short-run stimulus effect of the plan will be small , while America ’ s weak fiscal position implies a large long-run drag on the economy from the costs of servicing the resulting debt .
what I do not understand is opposition based on the claim that the stimulus package simply will not work : the government will spend its money , households will receive their tax rebates , and nothing will happen afterwards to boost employment and production . in fact , there is a surprisingly large current of thought that maintains that stimulus packages simply do not work , ever .
I simply do not understand their arguments that government spending cannot boost the economy . as far as I can tell , they are simply burying their heads in the sand .
then America ’ s businesses and investors discovered the Internet . over the next four years , annual US spending on information technology equipment and software roared upward , from $ 281 billion to $ 446 billion , the US unemployment rate dropped from 5.6 % to 4 % , and the economy grew at a 4.3 % real annual rate as the high-tech spending boom pulled extra workers out of unemployment and into jobs .
you can argue that neither group should have boosted its spending to such a degree – that both were subject to “ irrational exuberance ” – and that someone should have taken away the punchbowl earlier . but you cannot argue that these groups did not increase their spending , and that their increased spending did not pull large numbers of Americans – roughly two million in each case – into productive and valued employment .
the government ’ s money is as good as anybody else ’ s . if businesses ’ enthusiasm for spending on high-tech gadgetry and new homeowners ’ enthusiasm for spending on three-bedroom houses can boost employment and production , then what argument can Harvey , Fama , Barro , Steil , and company make that government spending will not ?
the Storm in Sub-Saharan Africa
Washington , DC – As the world struggles with the most serious financial turmoil of the post-war era , attention has focused on the advanced and emerging-market economies most immediately affected . but the impact on poor countries is far more severe .
the combination of tighter credit conditions in the advanced economies and dimmer economic prospects in low-income countries is hitting investment flows . and workers ’ remittances , which now eclipse aid as the biggest financial flows to low-income countries , are also falling .
many African countries have used the past decade to put in place sound and sustainable economic policies that have delivered robust growth and low inflation . together with debt relief , these policies have resulted in low levels of public debt , relatively sound financial systems , and – most important – rising living standards .
the high food and fuel prices that prevailed until recently have taken a heavy toll on the finances of many African economies . now they face a second blow from the global recession .
the priority for Africa and the international community must be to ensure that the continent weathers the global financial storm , preserves the significant achievements of the past decade , and continues to make decisive progress in combating poverty . this is not the time to take a break from efforts to achieve the United Nations ’ Millennium Development Goals .
but the international community must stand ready to help . my view is that strong policies on the African side , with strong support from the international community , offer the best prospects for sustained growth and poverty reduction in Africa .
this does not mean imposing rigid inflation targets . but a predictable monetary policy aimed at delivering medium-term price stability – with a flexible exchange rate where appropriate – benefits both the private sector and , most importantly , the poor .
this is not the time to renege on those commitments . it is equally important to restart global trade talks and bring the Doha Round to a successful conclusion – not least in order to protect Africa from the risk of rising protectionism .
we have increased our financing to the countries most heavily affected by food and fuel shocks . and we stand ready to provide additional support – including under a new financing mechanism for countries hit by exogenous shocks – to help those whom the global financial crisis has affected most severely .
we are also stepping up our technical assistance to strengthen economic policy making in Africa , and opening two new regional technical assistance centers . at the conference in Tanzania , we look forward to feedback and ideas about how the Fund can do even more – and differently .
as Africa and its partners navigate the financial storm together , we must ensure that the most vulnerable are not forgotten . we must also ensure that solutions for strengthening financial stability and avoiding future turmoil – the focus of April ’ s G-20 summit – are discussed with all countries concerned .
our shared objective is clear : to ensure that Africa not only weathers the immediate storm , but emerges from it stronger .
the Strange Death of Multiculturalism
an ideology which holds that people from different cultures must live in separate communities within a country , should not take an interest in each other and must not criticise each other is both wrong and unworkable . of course , multiculturalism ’ s more thoughtful advocates never imagined that a cultural community could or should substitute for a political community .
this evolved stealthily into a form of moral racism which held that white Europeans deserved liberal democracy but that people of different cultures had to wait for it . African dictators might do dreadful things but somehow they did not meet with condemnation from many European intellectuals , for criticism implied cultural arrogance .
the Netherlands , where I was born , has perhaps been divided by the debate over multiculturalism more than any other country . the murder of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh two and a half years ago by an Islamist assassin has incited a wrenching debate about the country ’ s entrenched culture of tolerance and easy access for asylum-seekers .
but at the moment that multiculturalism ’ s advocates were making this suggestion , Dutch society was undergoing a dramatic transition . with secularization taking hold , the traditional pillars began to break down .
from defining themselves as anti-colonialists and anti-racists – champions of multiculturalism amp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; they have become fervent defenders of so-called Enlightenment values against Muslim orthodoxy . these people feared the comeback of religion ; that the Protestant or Catholic oppressiveness they knew first-hand might be replaced by equally oppressive Muslim codes of conduct .
but their turn away from multiculturalism is not what prevented the emergence of a “ Islamic ” pillar in Dutch society . the main problem with this idea was that people from Turkey , Morocco , and the Arab countries , some deeply religious and some quite secular , and all with perceptible animosities towards each other , would never have agreed on what should constitute such a pillar .
in any case , it is now too late to create such a pillar . with the earlier pillars having collapsed , the emergence of a new one would bring about a situation where an increasingly integrated majority would be negotiating with a minority , thus perpetuating its isolation in the process .
many will not abandon their religion , so Europeans must learn to live with them and with Islam . of course , this will be easier if Muslims come to believe that the system also works to their benefit .
the children of immigrants , born in Europe , sense they are not fully accepted in the country where they grew up , but neither do they feel a special bond with their parent ’ s native country . Islamism , besides offering them an answer to the question why they do not feel happy with the way they live , gives them a sense of their self-worth and a great cause to die for .
in the end , the only thing that can truly damage European values is Europe ’ s response to its non-Muslim majority . fear of Islam and of immigrants could lead to the adoption of non-liberal laws .
our laws prohibiting incitement to violence and insulting people for reasons of their religion are sufficient . further constraints on freedom of speech – such as anti-blasphemy laws or , indeed , those laws that make Holocaust denial punishable – go too far .
insulting Muslims simply on the basis of their faith is foolish and counterproductive , as is the increasingly popular notion that we must make sweeping pronouncements as to the superiority of “ our culture . ” For such dogmatism undermines scepticism , the questioning of all views , including one ’ s own , which was and is the fundamental feature of the Enlightenment .
the reason for defending Enlightenment values is that they are based on good ideas , and not because they are “ our culture . ” To confuse culture and politics in this way is to fall into the same trap as the multiculturalists .
if we antagonize Europe ’ s Muslims enough we will push more people into joining the Islamist revolution . we must do everything to encourage Europe ’ s Muslim to become assimilated in European societies .
the Strange Rebirth of American Leadership
Florence – At the recent annual meetings of the American Economic Association , there was widespread pessimism about the future of the United States . “ The age of American predominance is over , ” declared one economist .
we have heard this story many times before , not only in the US , but in other places as well . George Dangerfield ’ s controversial history , The Strange Death of Liberal England , describes his country ’ s sudden decline at the peak of its power at the turn of the last century .
Dangerfield based his diagnosis on a cross-section of institutions , politics , and personalities , set against the bitter class warfare of the time . Americans , however , have generally been averse to class warfare .
optimists , touting GDP and other indicators , will continue to insist that Americans have never had it so good . if there is any continuity worth underscoring , it is the regular cohabitation of boosterism with declinism : America ’ s glass is always simultaneously half full and half empty .
both authors based their arguments on an assessment of the underlying context – that is , the structure – of world power . America was overstretched because its global liabilities were increasingly out of balance with its national assets , and it was bound to lead because the world as we know it is arranged favorably for it to do so .
similar arguments have been raised again recently . writers Parag Khanna and Fareed Zakaria have regurgitated those made by Kennedy , Nye , and forebears like Hedley Bull in asserting that the US must lead the world away from a “ new medievalism ” amid the “ rise of the rest ” and the relative stagnation of the “ West . ”
if we look at moments of so-called structural convergence – the 1880 ’ s , 1920 ’ s , 1950 ’ s and 1960 ’ s , and 1990 ’ s , in particular – we see the sources of American prosperity and power emerged in a global context , only to recede again . perhaps rise and fall is more of a cyclical than a linear phenomenon .
most historians place leadership in the foreground of human history , with structural variables having conditional , not causal , value . beneath even the richest soil , Dangerfield wrote , may lie the most perilous residue of discord and destruction .
are Americans specially blessed , or just lucky ? now that the US has at last begun to move , gradually and thoughtfully , away from the passions that characterized the country ’ s response to the 2001 terrorist attacks , it is worth asking if Bill Clinton was right to say that America ’ s virtues and assets always prevail against its vices and defects .
the writers mentioned above are less interested in the essence of power than in its exercise . they would rather have the US become more sophisticated in the ways of the world .
the US political system was never designed to rule the world . its checks and balances were meant to frustrate any such mission at the hands of an all-powerful executive , and it is doubtful that Americans would support such activism in perpetuity .
the secrets of American success are transparent yet difficult to quantify . Americans ’ pragmatism , opportunism , fair-mindedness , inventiveness , adaptability , optimism , and , above all , their inherent competitiveness offset their tendencies toward violence , impatience , self-righteousness , and unpredictability , their fondness for novelty and celebrity for their own sake , and their self-assertion en masse – getting there , as they like to say , “ fastest with the mostest . ”
those who understand Americans ’ deep-rooted passion for “ making it ” know why class or any other civil warfare has not succeeded in destroying America from within . the American character prefers displacement to destruction , the win-win to the zero-sum .
the Known Knowns of Climate Change
more recent research is piled toward the top of the pyramid , where most public debate takes place . it is an apt metaphor for climate-change research , and one worth bearing in mind with the publication of the latest report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
the IPCC ’ s fifth report , the product of several years of work by hundreds of climate scientists around the world , reviews our established understanding of climate change and explains more recent findings . the media understandably tend to focus on the latter – like the much higher sea-level rise predictions compared to the previous IPCC report of 2007 .
climate research dates back at least two centuries , to Joseph Fourier ’ s discovery of the effects of greenhouse gases on planetary climates ; in 1859 , John Tyndall demonstrated in his laboratory which gases cause this effect . detailed radiation measurements on the ground and from satellites have since proved the greenhouse effect ’ s existence .
we also know beyond doubt that emissions from human activities have substantially increased the amount of greenhouse gases ( especially carbon dioxide ) in our atmosphere . when the first IPCC report was published in 1990 , the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere had reached 354 parts per million ( up from the preindustrial baseline of 280 ppm ) .
IPCC reports have consistently given a range of 1.5-4.5ºC ( with a minor exception in the fourth report , which gave a range of 2.0-4.5ºC ) . natural climate changes in the past – for example the great ice ages – attest to the sensitivity of our planet ’ s climate to disturbances , and analyzing them is one method used by scientists to estimate this sensitivity .
an extraordinary , if underappreciated , feature of the IPCC ’ s reports is that , though many different scientists have worked on them over the past 23 years , the fundamental conclusions have not changed . this reflects an overwhelming consensus among scientists from around the world .
yet these conclusions need to be reaffirmed in the face of efforts by well-funded special-interest groups to sow doubt among the public . indeed , these efforts have been so successful that few members of the public are aware of the scientific consensus on the fundamentals of climate change .
at the end of the last Ice Age , for example , global temperature rose by about 5ºC over a period of 5,000 years . this was enough to transform the Earth ’ s vegetation cover , melt two-thirds of the continental ice masses , and raise sea levels by more than a hundred meters .
but , before millions of people are submerged , many will be struck by extreme weather events . record-breaking hot months now occur five times more frequently than they would in a stable , unchanging climate ; these heat waves cause droughts , wild fires , poor harvests , and , inevitably , loss of life .
the latest IPCC report describes our current predicament with disturbing clarity : global temperatures are climbing , mountain glaciers and polar ice caps are melting , sea levels are rising , and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more severe .
but our solid understanding of the fundamentals of global warming – the base of our knowledge of climate science – should provide reason enough to press on with the implementation of carbon-free energy technologies . with a rapid reduction in emissions , it is still possible to keep warming within safe bounds ( estimated at below 2ºC ) ; but the task is becoming increasingly difficult .
China ’ s Dream Team
new HAVEN – China ’ s recent leadership transition was widely depicted as a triumph for conservative hard-liners and a setback for the cause of reform – a characterization that has deepened the gloominess that pervades Western perceptions of China . in fact , nothing could be further from the truth .
first , Xi ’ s assumption of power is more complete than was the case in earlier transitions . by immediately taking the reins of both the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) and the Central Military Commission , he has a greater opportunity to put his personal stamp on policy than his predecessors had at the start of their administrations .
but Xi is well positioned to drive the thinking of a now-leaner decision-making body ( downsized from nine members to seven ) . moreover , he has long favored a market-friendly , scientific approach to economic development , which will be vital to China ’ s future .
second , Li Keqiang – the presumptive incoming premier – could be the big surprise in the new leadership team . unlike the current premier , Wen Jiabao , who was third in the chain of command for the past ten years , Li has been elevated to number two , which suggests a greater potential for power-sharing between the CCP and the government at the top of China ’ s new team .
third , and contrary to prevailing wisdom in the West , Wang Qishan , one of China ’ s savviest and most experienced senior officials , has not been relegated to obscurity in his new position overseeing “ discipline ” on the Standing Committee . yes , Wang has invaluable experience in the financial sector , and it would have been logical for him to assume similar responsibilities on the new leadership team .
that is especially true of Yu Zhengsheng and the two Zhangs , Dejiang and Gaoli , who come from senior roles in three of China ’ s most powerful and dynamic urban centers – Shanghai , Chongqing , and Tianjin . their deep knowledge of the key role played by urbanization in driving economic development will be critical to broadening the structural transformation that China now faces .
the West is not only overlooking the new Chinese leaders ’ enhanced skill set , but is also misjudging the current state of the country ’ s economy , which , while far from perfect , is not crisis-torn and in desperate need of a quick fix . in fact , China is emerging in reasonably good shape from yet another global slump .
but the same could have been said of the early utterances of Deng , modern China ’ s greatest reformer . as Ezra Vogel notes in Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China , Deng ’ s first public statement after his political rehabilitation in 1976 was , “ Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought constitute the guiding ideology of the party . ”
those were not exactly enlightened words – especially in view of what was shortly to come . yet Deng seized the moment at a critical juncture that is strikingly reminiscent of the one now faced by Xi and Li .
as is the case in any country ’ s leadership transition , no one knows for certain whether China ’ s incoming administration is up to the multiplicity of challenges that they face . since the days of Deng , China has had an uncanny ability to rise to the occasion and meet its challenges head on .
the Stressful Life of Laboratory Animals
research on animals is performed to gain more knowledge about diseases and how to cure them , and to evaluate drugs for toxicity before testing them on humans . in fact , animal studies have played a vital role in almost every major medical advance .
although researchers are committed to finding new ways to reduce and replace animal testing , current technology cannot yet replace many types of animal research . the Nuffield Council on Bioethics estimates that between 50 and 100 million animals , from flies to monkeys , are euthanized for research each year worldwide , with roughly 90 % of the vertebrate animals used for research being rodents .
gaining useful knowledge from animal research requires robust experimental findings : different scientists should be able to reproduce them in different locations . this requires a thorough understanding of each animal species and its biology .
stress is generally defined as the state that results when the brain instructs the body to make changes in order to adapt to a new or excessive demand and the individual perceives that the demand will exceed the personal resources which he or she has available . the response is fuelled by stress hormones that flow through the body , altering every organ and biochemical function , with wide-ranging effects on metabolism , growth , and reproduction .
although the environments of laboratory animals are usually well controlled in terms of lighting , temperature , and humidity , there are many uncontrolled sources of noise in animal facilities , most of which derive from human activities . these include high-pressure hoses , cage cleaners , and air-conditioners / heaters ; squeaking doors , carts , and movable chairs ; and jangling keys .
these noises can alter rodents ’ behavior and even adversely affect their health . yet , surprisingly , many scientists are unaware that loud noises in their animal facilities can affect research outcomes and compromise their data .
apart from noise problems , research animals are often housed in small cages with no source of enrichment , such as wheels , shelves , or tubes . such devices enable animals to exert some control over their environment , such as escaping an attack from a cage-mate by moving to another level in the cage or hiding .
often , researchers are unwilling to include such items in their animals ’ cages because other researchers do not . however , rigorous standardization of the environment , particularly if it leads to barren surroundings , increases the risk of obtaining results that , being specific to a narrow set of conditions , cannot be compared with other researchers ’ results .
researchers often dismiss questions concerning environmental influences on their experimental data by claiming that such effects “ cancel out , ” because their control animals are housed under the same conditions . but the conclusions drawn from such experiments are specific to the stressed animals and cannot necessarily be extrapolated to healthy animals .
genetically modified mice either lack a specific gene or gene-pair ( knock-out mice ) or carry a piece of foreign DNA integrated into their own chromosomes ( transgenic mice ) , and are used to deduce the functions of particular genes . studies are beginning to show that an animal ’ s environmental conditions can completely change the results of genetic studies .
normal and aberrant behaviors for each species could be agreed upon institutionally and a list made available to all investigators . designing an environment to suit animals ’ psychological and physiological needs would be far preferable to the minimalism , otherwise known as “ standardization , ” that is currently employed .
but the end result would be similar . both the welfare of research animals and the quality of the science would be markedly improved , leading to data that could be meaningfully applied to our quest for medical knowledge .
the Strong Force is Almost With Us
today , this promise remains unfulfilled . development of nuclear technology has stagnated , with nuclear power plants still using technology developed a half-century ago.amp # 160 ;
the nuclei of their atoms usually decay into two smaller nuclei and a couple of neutrons , releasing many million times more energy than any chemical process ever could . heavy elements contain so much energy because they stored a fraction of the energy released in the supernova explosion that created our Earth and the solar system around five billion years ago.amp # 160 ;
today ’ s power plants use as a fuel a special kind of Uranium , U-235 , which is burned in a chain process whereby the neutrons from one nuclear decay induce the next decay . neither Uranium-238 , which is roughly 100 times more abundant than U-235 , nor Thorium , which is even more accessible , is used to produce energy on a large scale .
indeed , in principle , every heavy element , even lead , is a potential source of nuclear energy . everybody who has studied nuclear decay processes has been struck by the myriad possible ways in which energy can be produced .
from the scientific point of view , the main problem is a lack of knowledge . despite many hundreds of well-functioning nuclear power plants , our understanding of nuclear forces is only empirical , and empirical knowledge is always imperfect .
for example , in producing nuclear energy , the decay reactions repeat many times , with the imperfections of every repetition resulting in a loss of predictive power of computations . this hampers the optimization process , and is one of the main reasons why several large projects investigating energy production using more abundant Uranium-238 or Thorium ( fast breeder reactors ) were closed in Europe and the United States before they achieved the expected level of performance .
another problem is the nuclear waste that emerges when energy is produced in the decay process . the waste can be substantially , or even completely , reduced if we could use an alternative form of nuclear decay that is triggered by externally accelerated particles .
the force binding atomic nuclei is a special case of the “ strong force , ” one of the four fundamental forces in nature , and is extremely difficult to investigate , because it acts very quickly and violently . around 50 years ago , it was proposed to study the strong forces by firing protons at each other at very high energies .
the acceleration of particles at high energy slows down all physical processes , because , according to Einstein ’ s theory of relativity , time runs more slowly for fast-moving objects . since protons are the simplest nuclei , it was hoped that , at high energy , the forces acting during the scattering of protons could be observed and analyzed like in a slow-motion film , providing a precise understanding of the strong force .
several large accelerator research centers were built , and the scattering of particles at high energies revealed a fascinating structure of matter . new particles , called gluons , were found to mediate the strong force .
but , at larger distances , comparable to the proton radius , the force becomes really strong , and a very large number of gluons is involved , forming complicated structures that are not well known today . therefore , for some time , it was not expected that the properties of the strong force could be directly derived from the properties of gluons .
in the last few years , however , experiments at the HERA accelerator in Hamburg , Germany , have observed the strong interaction effects in slow motion , which could open a way to a precise understanding of the strong force . at the HERA accelerator , the scattering of electrons on protons was studied at the highest energies ever for this type of experiment .
one of its most important discoveries was that several distinct phenomena observed at high energies and short distances could be clearly attributed to the emission of gluons and the emergence of gluonic structures . by observing how these structures change while increasing the distance , it should be possible to follow – and thus to understand – the action of the strong force .
but the precision experiments required to measure the strong force can be designed and built with known technology . so two large groups of physicists – one concentrated around the Brookhaven and Jefferson National Laboratories in the United States , and the other around CERN in Geneva – are proposing to restart the investigation of electron-proton interactions .
and , as the history of physics has shown , a better understanding of natural forces will open new , completely unexpected possibilities . for example , our understanding of electromagnetic force , developed mostly in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , gave rise to today ’ s breathtaking developments in telecommunications , computers , chemistry , and material sciences .
a preciseunderstanding of the strong force could be just as important , opening new ways to use nuclear-energy resources while solving the problems of safety and nuclear waste .
what ’ s Stopping Europe ?
French production costs are high , but Greek costs are higher . despite the considerable decline in Greek ( and Italian and Spanish ) real GDP since 2007 , adjustment is far from complete .
in fact , one would be hard pressed to find broad agreement with Hollande ’ s assessment anywhere in Europe . before the recent Italian election , financial markets showed signs of optimism , encouraged by the European Central Bank ’ s policy of guaranteeing eurozone members ’ sovereign debt , expanding its balance sheet , and lowering interest rates .
there is a vast difference between unit labor costs – real wages adjusted for productivity – in Germany and in the heavily indebted southern countries . when the crisis began , production costs in Greece were about 30 % higher than in Germany , so Greece exported very little and imported very much .
austerity reduced the number of employed workers , particularly those with low skill and productivity levels . but gains in measured productivity growth from this source are not permanent changes , so a large part of the reported reductions in unit labor costs are temporary .
that will prolong excessive government spending , and deficit targets will not be met on a sustained basis . large reductions in public-sector wages brought down the primary deficit , but employment maintenance lowers productivity , raises costs , and delays adjustment .
and Italy ’ s parliament rejected many of Monti ’ s proposed reductions in government spending . labor and many product markets remain closed , despite the urgent need to increase competition , lower production costs , and raise productivity .
after five years of slow growth and rising unemployment , voters in other indebted countries , like Italians ( and French voters before them ) , are likely to reject additional spending reductions , tax increases , and further painful deregulation . Europe must find more effective policies that reduce production costs toward German levels .
the economic historian Harold James has shown in a recent book that in the 40 years of negotiations leading to the adoption of the common currency , all of the problems that now beset the eurozone were discussed repeatedly . everyone understood that a monetary union would require enforceable fiscal and banking rules .
it works slowly , if at all , because elected governments are often reluctant to implement their promises – and may not feel bound by those of previous administrations ( especially if they owe their victory to voters who are rebelling against years of belt-tightening with no evidence of renewed growth ) . likewise , politicians are reluctant to adopt deregulation that eliminates state-sponsored special privileges .
let all the heavily indebted southern European countries jointly agree to join a weak euro , which would float against the stronger northern euro . when the weak euro reduces the heavily indebted countries ’ production costs by 20-25 % , they can rejoin the “ hard ” euro if they accept fiscal reforms that are subject to approval by the European Commission ( and thus by the hard-euro creditor countries ) .
after five years of decline in living standards , voters oppose more austerity and further retrenchment without growth . restoring a sound euro requires policies that revive growth , rein in government spending , and reform heavily regulated labor and product markets .
the Struggle for Syria
but the role of external regional forces is almost as important in fueling the domestic bloodshed as what is happening internally . if Syria could break free of the negative influences of regional politics , genuine change without continued violence might become possible .
Syria needs to manage its diverse ethnic and religious composition , and to decide its own position on the Arab-Israeli conflict . but that is more difficult when neighboring countries are exploiting the country &apos;s heterogeneous makeup to pursue their own hegemonic agendas .
to the south sits Saudi Arabia , with its long friendship with the United States and its inherent hostility toward Iran &apos;s Islamic Republic . and to the north is Turkey , a pro-European , largely secular and democratic country that seeks to wield influence across the Arab world .
the region in and around Syria is also populated by extremist Islamist groups that are attempting to expand their spheres of influence - and that are quick to capitalize on instability in any country . Syria is particularly vulnerable in this regard , as extremists incite violence against minority religious groups by using , for example , television stations in Saudi Arabia and Egypt .
the current regime in Syria , in its ruthless quest to remain in power , refuses to acknowledge peaceful protesters &apos; demands for freedom and dignity . if it did - and if it met those demands - Islamists would not be able to hijack the demonstrations .
peaceful change in Syria can nonetheless be achieved , and the international community can influence that process by recognizing that its continued focus on the country &apos;s “ complexity ” does nothing for its people . in fact , the obsession with Syria &apos;s sectarian rivalries provides destabilizing external forces with the oxygen that their inflammatory rhetoric requires .
the incitement against Syrian religious minorities promulgated by extremist TV stations , and by people like the Chief Justice of Saudi Arabia &apos;s Supreme Judicial Council , coupled with equally damaging behavior by Iran , if left unchecked , could result in an even worse bloodbath , with Syria &apos;s people drawn into a war of all against all .
the international community allowed change in Tunisia and Egypt to proceed at those countries &apos; own pace . in Syria , a Libyan-style military intervention is not warranted , but diplomatic intervention is needed to allow the country &apos;s people to determine its future .
the international community &apos;s goal must be to persuade neighboring countries to halt their brazen , unwarranted attacks on parts of Syrian society . in particular , the US , which has significant influence in Saudi Arabia , must act to stop attacks by that country &apos;s extremists on Syria &apos;s religious minorities - attacks motivated merely by a desire to provoke sectarian conflict .
for them , peaceful , gradual change is the best option . and that requires a national dialogue , overseen by the international community , aimed at bolstering internal unity – and thus at protecting the country from regional interference .
the situation in Syria is usually – and rightly – described as an intricate , multi-dimensional playing field with a wide variety of political actors and competing interests . but there has been an inadequate focus on the Syrian people ’ s simple desire for genuine reform , greater personal freedom , and more economic opportunity .
Syrians have experienced uninterrupted dictatorship for 40 years , and , with it , extreme economic hardship , including high unemployment , rising food prices , and endemic corruption . they are also now suffering from water shortages and a budget deficit that has been exacerbated by declining oil revenues .
with international assistance in developing Syria ’ s democratic institutions and political infrastructure , we can build a robust civil society that can assert its own identity and sovereignty , independent of undue outside influence . a new Syria , based on democratic principles , would not only benefit Syrians , but would be a force for stability throughout the region .
the Sugar Season
the holiday season that is now upon us is a time for festivity , and usually of overeating . but the rampant consumption of sugar that marks this time of year is nothing to celebrate .
in fact , this seasonal upsurge in sugar consumption is just part of a huge transition in world health that is now underway . many countries , especially developing countries , are facing the consequences of huge changes in lifestyle : modifications in diet , lower levels of physical activity , and increased tobacco use .
these changes are determined , to a large extent , by the globalization and expansion of food markets , and by ever-greater levels of urbanization . both of these factors incite sedentary behavior at home and at work , as well as profound alterations in dietary habits .
so it should be no surprise that noncommunicable diseases ( NCD &apos;s ) , including cardiovascular diseases ( CVD &apos;s ) , obesity , diabetes and cancer , now kill roughly 33 million people around the world each year , and cause almost 60 % of total deaths . indeed , they account for almost half the global burden of disease .
by 2020 , that contribution is expected to rise to 73 % of all deaths and 60 % of the global burden of disease . moreover , more than 60 % these deaths occur in the developing world , and here NCD &apos;s increasingly appear in younger age groups , which can have huge implications for how productive a country &apos;s workers are .
recent data from China reflect the extent of the problem . in China &apos;s rural areas , with more than 800 million people , NDC &apos;s account for more than 80 % of deaths .
many countries are now afflicted by a double burden of diseases . countries that still struggle with malnutrition and illnesses like malaria , tuberculosis , and HIV / AIDS , now must contend with an explosion of CVD &apos;s , diabetes , and obesity , as well as soaring rates of high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol .
indeed , five of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide are related to diet and physical activity : high blood pressure , high cholesterol , low intake of fruit and vegetables , high body mass index , and insufficient exercise . clearly , effective strategies to tackle the NCD burden require a critical examination of what people are eating and their levels of physical activity .
one of the strategy &apos;s key conclusions is that reducing the burden of NCD &apos;s requires a multi-sectoral approach . like a toolbox , the strategy provides WHO members with a comprehensive range of policy options from which to choose .
transport ministries should provide safe roads so that children can bike to school . finance ministers could tax unhealthy food and subsidize healthy food .
most of what WHO is recommending has been endorsed by public health officials for many years . but we face a global problem , with many international stakeholders , and this requires an urgent and worldwide response .
this debate is both welcome and to be expected ; improving diet and finding ways to increase physical activity is a complex issue . Moreover. there will always be groups with their own interests , using arguments that we do not have sufficient evidence to act .
the strongest critique has come from sugar associations , who claim that the upper limit of 10 % on caloric intake from sugar is not based upon scientific evidence . however , more than twenty national and international reports from around the world by scientific bodies governing dietary recommendations set similar or lower targets for sugar intake .
the growing NCD and CVD burden is a time bomb for world health . the implementation of the WHO &apos;s strategy could lead to one of the largest-ever positive shifts in human health , putting populations throughout the world on pathways to lifelong and sustained improvements in well-being .
the Summit of Europe ’ s Ineffectiveness
just look at the way it reacts when the other side decides not to show up ( for example , its response to President Barack Obama ’ s decision not to attend the May EU-US summit in Madrid ) . if the EU wants to be taken seriously and have a tangible impact , it needs to learn that talking about the right things is no substitute for taking the right kind of action .
but any deployment of trainers is seen as too dangerous , expensive , and likely to fail . instead , individual member states are going it alone , with their own bite-sized assistance projects .
the EU is equally unlikely to change dramatically its development-aid policies towards Pakistan . questions of capacity , corruption , and quality assurance remain unanswered , and with the US granting $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , any change in the EU stance would be relatively insignificant .
since his five-year term began in September 2008 , Zardari has found it hard to assert his authority . like his predecessor , General Pervez Musharraf , he is in danger of falling victim to a tide of anti-Americanism , fueled by disquiet over US policies in Pakistan , such as the use of military drones and covert operations .
unlike Musharraf , Zardari cannot count on the support of the army , which remains Pakistan ’ s most powerful state institution . it has already reacted furiously to attempts to curb its powers and rein in the activities of its intelligence apparatus .
even the engaged US finds it difficult to attain its aims : witness the Pakistani interpretation of America ’ s $ 7.5 billion aid package as interference rather than goodwill . so why should the EU even bother ?
in its 2009 intelligence assessment ( the TE-SAT Terrorism Situation and Trend Report ) , Europol concluded that “ Pakistan &#91; has &#93; replaced Iraq as preferred destinations for volunteers wishing to engage in armed conflict . ” A senior EU official spelled out what this means : there had been “ many cases in the recent past where either Pakistanis were coming to Europe or young EU citizens were going to Pakistan for training and being brainwashed . ”
but , in order to be taken seriously by the US , the EU needs to bring well-developed , well-resourced policies to the table , rather than 27 half-baked ideas . so a second reason for revamping the EU ’ s Pakistan policy is to be able to help shape US policy rather than be a passive by-stander .
the US made Pakistan a top-priority Cold War ally . as a result , many unsavory aspects of Pakistan ’ s conduct went unchallenged by America , while its military and intelligence services were handsomely resourced .
ordinary Pakistanis hate the US because they believe that America supported years of oppression and military rule , while Pakistani elites are wary of anything that may undermine the position they have come to enjoy . the US , therefore , will never be seen as a constructive partner in Pakistan ’ s development .
Pakistan matters to Europe , and Europe could matter much more to Pakistan . if the EU wants to be a serious global player to which the US turns as a credible partner ( showing up at its summits , for a start ) , the Pakistan-EU summit is a good opportunity to start replacing words with action .
the Summit of Muted Intentions
one such issue was the so-called Free-Trade Area of the Americas , which was proposed by former US President George H.W. Bush in 1990 , and then collapsed at the Mar del Plata summit in Argentina in 2005 . incensed by the presence of Bush père ’ s son , President George W. Bush , Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez rallied thousands of anti-American demonstrators to protest against the agreement .
the Summit of the Americas thus serves as a bellwether of United States-Latin American relations , even if it fails to accomplish much of significance .
this year ’ s summit , which will take place in Cartagena , Colombia , in mid-April , has already generated controversy . two traditional hot-button issues will dominate the discussions : Cuba and drugs .
Cuba has never been invited to the Summit of the Americas , because the meeting was designed to include only members of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) and democratically elected presidents ( although Peru ’ s then-president , Alberto Fujimori , attended in 1998 , despite having suspended the country ’ s constitution in an “ auto-coup ” in 1992 ) .
in February , Ecuador ’ s president , Rafael Correa , declared that if Cuban President Raúl Castro were not invited to the Summit , the ALBA countries ( Cuba , Venezuela , Ecuador , Nicaragua , Bolivia , and some of the Caribbean islands ) would not attend . this was clearly intended to provoke the US , Canada , and a handful of other countries opposed to his presence .
several Latin American leaders and commentators recommended that US President Barack Obama attend , despite Castro ’ s presence , in order to confront him about Cuba ’ s dearth of democracy . Obama did not take the bait : an accidental photo opportunity or public debate with Raúl Castro in the middle of an election campaign is not how a US president wins a second term .
Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos tried to defuse the issue by first ascertaining whether the Cubans actually wanted to be invited . having sent his foreign minister to Havana to ask , he received a surprising response : Cuba did wish to attend , despite having rejected in 2009 an invitation to return to the OAS .
it was clear to Santos that , if Castro attended , the Cartagena summit would take place without Obama , Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper , and perhaps a few other heads of state . if , on the other hand , Castro did not attend , some of the ALBA members , including two neighbors with which Colombia hopes to improve relations – Ecuador and Venezuela – might not show up , either .
in the end , Santos , like his summit-hosting predecessors , had no choice but to inform the Cubans personally that they were not welcome , as “ there was no consensus regarding their participation . ” Despite talk of growing Latin American independence and Castro ’ s recent reforms , most countries , when forced to choose between Cuba and the US , choose the latter .
so Castro will not attend , Obama will , and the ALBA leaders will probably be divided . the participants will try to ensure that Cuba is invited to the next summit in 2015 , but it is difficult to predict what will happen .
nevertheless , whereas only a smattering of political leaders and intellectuals advocated legalization in the past , nowadays officials are coming “ out of the closet ” on drugs in droves . those who used to say that they favored a debate on the issue now support legalization ; those who opposed it now accept the need for debate ; and those who continue to oppose legalization do so on moral , rather than rational , grounds .
his foreign-policy challenges , with the exception of Iran ’ s nuclear-enrichment program and Israel ’ s reaction to it , come second to the US economy ’ s health , and its impact on his re-election . Latin America – even Mexico – is not on his radar screen at the moment .
nonetheless , Obama will go to Cartagena , as he should . the US has learned by now that it is in the country ’ s best interests to pay close attention to its southern neighbors .
the Sumo and the Yakuza
wrestlers wash their faces , mouths , and armpits before entering the dohyo ( ring ) , on whose sacred sand neither shoes nor women may tread . before a match starts , the two contestants raise their hands to show that they are not hiding weapons in the folds of their loincloth-like belt .
the elders of the Japan Sumo Association ( JSA ) , the retired wrestlers who govern the sport , see themselves less as administrators than as guardians of a holy tradition . they promote wrestlers to the highest ranks not just on brute merit , but according to how much hinkaku ( dignity ) they are judged to possess .
allegations of match-fixing , dope-smoking , orgies , and ties to gangsters among the sport ’ s top stars have enraged the Japanese public . indeed , Japanese Sumo circles are now facing growing public infamy , causing many Japanese to wonder if the country , after 20 years of stagnation , is capable of purifying itself .
backed by an enraged public , the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department ( MPD ) recently searched some 30 sites , including a raid on a major Sumo “ stable , ” or training center . the move was made in an effort to seize material evidence about the nexus between Sumo wrestling and the “ Yakuza , ” Japan ’ s Mafia-like organized-crime groups that date from the seventeenth century .
the investigation continues , and the MPD has not yet referred anyone to prosecutors . but the incessant , extended media coverage of the investigation suggests that the MPD has provided – and possibly even leaked – information from the investigation to journalists , a routine but legally dubious means of gaining public support .
indeed , there is a long tradition of retired police “ parachuting ” into lucrative posts in “ Pachinko , ” the de-facto gambling industry and , to a lesser extent , across the public gambling sectors . these links raise the question of the real objective of the Japanese police , a bureaucratic behemoth , in their investigation of the Sumo circle .
Sumo evolved over many centuries as a peripatetic form of public entertainment in which the wrestlers , trainers , and promoters depended on local gangs to secure facilities and an audience , including selling the tickets . this cozy relationship was supposedly dissolved when the traditional Sumo circle was modernized , becoming today ’ s JSA .
Sumo , as a traditional spectacle , cannot survive without respectable patrons . but Japan ’ s wealthiest people , such as entrepreneurs , medical doctors , and lawyers , are nowadays less willing or financially able to continue patronizing the sport , particularly since the collapse of Japan ’ s asset bubble in the early 1990 ’ s .
instead , these respectable supporters have gradually been replaced over the years by a shady new class of rich Japanese , who have risen through loan-sharking and other dubious businesses . as a result , some Sumo stables have become associated in one way or another with people running front companies for Yakuza organizations .
in the 1950 ’ s , Japanese ministers and industrialists sometimes relied on nationalist elements of Yakuza groups to quash unions and socialists . the gangs then upheld classic Japanese virtues of manliness and loyalty – and paid for mistakes by slicing off one of their fingers in atonement .
but Japan ’ s long-floundering economy has eaten revenue from traditional activities that required muscle , such as gambling , prostitution , and loan-sharking . for example , “ land-sharking ” – the practice of coercing landowners to sell their land and then flipping it for huge profits – is no longer as lucrative as it once was , because land prices have been flat for years .
once he is released , it is anticipated that he will direct a major drive to revitalize his organization through both its traditional and new illegal activities . some analysts suspect that the Sumo circle has provided some of the best match tickets to Yakuza leaders , who , as matches were shown on television , sent signals to the godfather that they remain loyal to him .
so it is likely that next year will see a showdown between the police and the “ Yamaguchi-Gumi . ” The Sumo gambling scandal , indeed , may be a prelude to it .
the Sun Will Rise Again
the number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami that assaulted the Tohoku region of northeast Japan has now reached around 30,000 , if those who are still missing are included . this was the largest natural disaster to strike Japan in its history , and the entire nation has been in mourning .
throughout this period , television stations , in response to viewers ’ feelings , have refrained from showing frivolous programs and gaudy commercials . many of the hanami events , for celebrating the annual eruption of cherry blossoms , a much-loved activity for us Japanese , have been canceled .
the strong bonds ( kizuna ) of the Japanese people create great solidarity during dark times such as these . one virtue of kizuna can be seen in people ’ s inability to enjoy themselves in their usual ways in the face of the loss of so many countrymen and the knowledge that 200,000 more are enduring harsh conditions in evacuation centers .
but there are concerns that these bonds of kizuna may also bind the Japanese economy , which must recover as soon as possible – not only for the benefit of the Japanese , but also because disruptions in Japan ’ s economy are hitting the rest of Asia , owing to the production chains of which Japan is an integral part .
the tourism industry has been directly hit by people refraining from travel , and the abundant hot springs in the Tohoku region , normally popular with tourists and totally unaffected by the earthquake or tsunami , have become a victim of the disaster . similarly , the baseless rumor that all of Japan is soaked in radiation has caused tourism from abroad to plummet .
meetings and parties in Tokyo have been canceled , and this has directly affected not only hotels and inns , but also the liquor industry and the food and beverage industry . the restaurant industry , too , is being pushed to the wall .
likewise , customers who formed lines to buy up water and toilet paper immediately after the disaster are now slow to return to supermarkets . and this tendency to shun all purchases except disaster-related goods , is not limited to east Japan .
indeed , the Japanese economy , which has endured two decades of sluggishness , has been falling behind in the global economy even more since the shockwaves caused by Lehman Brothers ’ collapse in 2008 . now it has been struck by a combination of prolonged deflation and the shocks caused by the recent natural disasters .
the profound disruption of the economy will continue at least until that time . it took a year for consumption to recover after the Kobe earthquake in 1995 , but the widespread damage did create widespread demand back then , and should do so again .
enormous demand will be created for construction of temporary housing and , later , for the reconstruction of lost towns . the estimated damage of ¥ 25 trillion is also the size of the potential reconstruction demand .
but Japan ’ s government needs to think big and creatively . if towns suffering from depopulation before they were destroyed are transformed in their reconstruction , they could mark the emergence of a new model for regional development that can decentralize Japan ’ s Tokyo-centric economy .
farmland that had been worked by an aging population with no successors , and that was subdivided into blocs that were too small , has now become vacant , opening the way for much larger-scale farming . similarly , individually operated fishing businesses whose potential heirs ended up choosing other careers can now be reorganized and consolidated , thereby taking advantage of greater economies of scale .
perhaps most importantly , the nuclear accident has shed a stark light on the need for safe , renewable energy , which had been shunned in the past . the current government has plans to generate power using large-scale solar and wind power plants in the disaster-affected areas .
indeed , the only way truly to honor those who lost their lives is to create a new-model Japan from the tsunami ’ s wreckage , rather than simply restoring towns and their economies to their previous decadent conditions .
the Sustainability Mindset
and , as Ben Friedman of Harvard University argued persuasively in his 2006 book The Moral Consequences of Growth , economic growth is good for open and democratic societies . but markets and capitalist incentives have clear weaknesses in ensuring stability , equity , and sustainability , which &amp; nbsp ; can adversely affect political and social cohesion .
obviously , abandoning market-capitalist systems , and implicitly growth , is not really an option . collectively , we have little choice but to try to adapt the system to changing technological and global conditions in order to achieve stability , equity ( in terms of opportunity and outcomes alike ) , and sustainability .
the global economy will probably triple in size in the next quarter-century , largely owing to growth in developing countries as they catch up to developed-country incomes and adopt similar consumption patterns . thus , there is a well-founded fear that the planet ’ s natural resources ( broadly defined ) and recuperative capacities will not withstand the pressure .
but , in developing countries , where only sustained growth can lift people out of poverty , limiting it cannot be the answer . the alternative is to change the growth model in order to lighten the impact of higher levels of economic activity on natural resources and the environment .
everyone , not just policymakers , needs to understand the consequences of our individual and collective choices . we need to be aware for example , that population growth and rising consumption levels have intergenerational consequences , and that how we conduct ourselves will affect the lifestyles and opportunities of our children and grandchildren . &amp; nbsp ;
thus far , the quality of our choices has been unimpressive , reflecting little sensitivity to sustainability and the impact of our choices on future generations . as a result , many developed countries have built up dangerously large public debts and even larger non-debt liabilities , owing to unsustainable growth patterns .
so perhaps incomplete knowledge of the consequences of our choices is responsible . moreover , an unfunded liability path , once taken , is hard to leave , because at the point of departure , some generation is paying for past commitments and at least beginning to fund future ones .
most people might agree that living beyond our means in the aggregate , via unfunded social services and insurance , or disproportionate use of resources , imposes a burden on our offspring . but we might still fail to reach agreement on who should pay for funding these programs , or for reducing our consumption of resources .
education and values are the foundation of sound individual and , ultimately , collective choices . without them , the incentives and policies that economists rightly argue are needed to increase energy efficiency , limit carbon emissions , economize on water usage , and much more will lack support and fail in the democratic decision-making process .
environmentalists are right to focus on education and individual choices , even when their policy proposals are not always on target . education and values will drive local innovation , alter lifestyles , and shift social norms .
complementary national policies and international agreements will require careful scientific and economic analysis and thoughtful choices . the need for burden-sharing , particularly between advanced and developing countries , will not magically disappear .
appropriate regulation and sufficiently long time horizons can make structures of all kinds much more energy-efficient , without imposing burdensome costs . in a similar way , transportation can become less energy-intensive without restricting mobility .
that is why climate-change negotiations are shifting from the misguided objective of seeking risky 50-year commitments to binding carbon-emissions targets to focusing on parallel , step-by-step processes , including higher energy efficiency , better urban planning , improved transportation systems , and on learning as we go . likewise , businesses and industries that are heavy water users will simply develop new technologies and thrive in the face of scarcity .
progress has been helped by growing awareness in populous Asia – and in developing countries generally – that sustainability is the key to achieving their longer-term growth objectives . this perspective perhaps comes more naturally in an environment of rapid growth , because their growth models require continual review and adaptation to be sustainable .
policies aimed at sustainability are likely to follow . what is unknown is whether we will reach that point fast enough to avoid major disruptions , or even potential conflict .
the Swedenization of Europe
anti-Semitism , anti-Zionism , and anti-Americanism are becoming linked and ever more rabid in today &apos;s Europe . they arise from a kind of blindness , combined with a strange mixture of alienation , guilt , and fear toward both Israel and America .
Israel cannot afford to lose one major war , as it would mean the end of the Jewish democratic state . but huge numbers of Europeans believe that something is fundamentally wrong with the Israelis : they never compromise ; they prefer using military means to solve political problems .
something similar is at work in the European attitude to the US . look at Europe , many Europeans say , we have eradicated wars , dangerous nationalism , and dictatorships .
as a Swede , I have heard such pacific boasting all my life : that neutral Sweden is a moral superpower . now this bragging has become the EU &apos;s ideology .
without the Marshall Plan and NATO , it would not have taken off economically . without the policy of containment under America &apos;s security umbrella , the Red Army would have strangled the dream of freedom in Eastern Europe , or brought European unity , but under a flag with red stars .
in many places , torture chambers are the rules of the game , not the grotesque and shameful mistakes of ill-supervised troops . any attempt in such places to go behave the European way and negotiate - without the military power needed to back up diplomacy - would be pathetic .
instead of supporting those who fight international terrorism , many Europeans try to blame the spread of terrorism on Israel and the US . this is a new European illusion .
indeed , modern anti-Zionist rhetoric portrays Israel &apos;s goal as domination of the whole Middle East . such ideas are reflected in opinions polls in which Europeans claim that Israel and the US are the true dangers to world peace .
Ian Buruma , the British writer , claims that this European rage against America and Israel has to do with guilt and fear . the two world wars led to such catastrophic carnage that &quot; never again &quot; was interpreted as &quot; welfare at home , non-intervention abroad . &quot;
extreme anti-Americanism and anti-Zionism are actually merging . the so-called peace poster &quot; Hitler Had Two Sons : Bush and Sharon , &quot; displayed in European anti-war rallies , combines trivialization of Nazism with demonization of both the victims of Nazism and those who defeated Nazism .
much of this grows from a subconscious European guilt related to the Holocaust . now the Holocaust &apos;s victims - and their children and grandchildren - are supposedly doing to others what was done to them .
&quot; the ugly Israeli &quot; and &quot; the ugly American &quot; seem to be of the same family . &quot; the ugly Jew &quot; becomes the instrumental part of this defamation when so-called neoconservatives are blamed both for American militarism and Israeli brutalities and then selectively named : Wolfowitz , Perle , Abrams , Kristol , etc .
earlier this year , the editor of Die Zeit , Josef Joffe , put his finger on the issue : like Jews , Americans are said to be selfish and arrogant . like Jews , they are in thrall to a fundamentalist religion that renders them self-righteous and dangerous .
the links between anti-Semitism , anti-Zionism , and anti-Americanism are all too real . unless Europe &apos;s leaders roundly condemn this unholy triple alliance , it will poison Middle East politics and transatlantic relations alike .
the Geneva Conversion
in the days , weeks , and months ahead , the arrangements to remove chemical weapons from Syria will , one hopes , begin a new era in which the US and Russia work together on other pressing global issues as well . a cooperative US-Russia relationship is essential if the international system , now almost dysfunctional , is to work properly in the future .
Russian President Vladimir Putin ’ s clumsy foray into the American debate infuriated many Americans ( including me ) , but it was certainly a teachable moment . many outside the US thought it was high time that someone offered America a taste of its own paternalism – and even better that that someone was Putin , a politician who has , to put it gently , his own set of foibles .
as a practical matter , Putin certainly does not seem to be suffering any adverse domestic political consequences from his bashing in the US . more broadly , America ’ s supply of moralistic – and even churlish – advice to the rest of the world has greatly exceeded international demand for it .
many countries – Syria qualifies as a poster child in this regard – suffer under miserable , brutal governments . but backing an armed rebellion is a major step , especially when the rebels whom one is backing have , as in Syria , started something that they may not be able to finish .
this is not to say that the US should never support insurgencies against established governments ; but doing so is almost always a lonely affair , without any realistic expectation of enlisting many partners in the process . such policy choices should be made rarely , and with a clear understanding that support for the violent overthrow of a government is not very popular around the world .
the road that got the US to the Geneva agreement with the Russians was long and windy , and may indeed have done some damage to America ’ s standing in the world , even though the outcome was better than any other on offer . to put that process behind it , the US needs to follow up with the Russians to establish a broader pattern of long-overdue cooperation .
call it a “ reset ” button – like the one then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave to Lavrov in 2009 – or whatever one wants . but it should be more than a gag gift .
a good place to start would be to seek a Syrian peace deal that enables the country ’ s different communities – now butchering each other – to live in one state . maybe the US is right that Syria ’ s brutal and mendacious president , Bashar al-Assad , cannot be part of any eventual solution .
at this point , any peace process is a long shot , but so is the prospect of either side winning militarily , with or without the arrival of American arms for the rebels . the alternative of allowing this fight to the death to play out – a proposal heard daily on American talkathon television – is not worthy of our civilization .
the world needs all hands on deck – not only Russian and American , but also Arab , Chinese , European , and anyone else ’ s . the beacon of hope shining from Geneva should guide us all .
the Tabloid Syndrome
so how are we to understand even just a piece of it , say , the United States government and its economic policies ? it is a big problem , for the standard sources that I was taught as a child to rely upon – newspapers and television news – are breaking down .
for example , in early February 2004 , the then Chairman of the President ’ s Council of Economic Advisers , N. Gregory Mankiw , spent some time trying to explain the issues surrounding “ outsourcing ” to America ’ s elite political news reporters . Mankiw ’ s standard description of outsourcing is very much like mine – indeed , like that of all neoclassical and neoliberal economists – and goes something like this :
as with any change in technology that increases the volume of international trade in goods and services , the outsourcing of service-sector jobs creates winners and losers – but almost surely more and bigger winners than losers . big winners are workers in poor countries who get better jobs working for firms that can now export services to rich countries .
workers in certain industries find their skills in higher demand as foreigners spend their increased dollar earnings , consumers benefit from lower prices , and shareholders and managers see their companies ’ profits increase . however much we may worry about the distributional consequences of outsourcing , we should never overlook the fact that it increases the total size of the economic pie .
it happened again on February 11 : “ Democrats ... lit into President Bush ’ s chief economist yesterday for his laudatory statements on the movement of U.S. jobs abroad .... Rep. Donald Manzullo ( R-Ill . ) called for the resignation of N. Gregory Mankiw ... ”
they didn ’ t claim that what he said was inaccurate , or shortsighted , or analytically unsound . the descriptive terms they used – “ discordant , ” “ embarrassing , ” “ political liability ” – suggest that they knew they were giving Mankiw a raw deal .
but was there any sign of the standard economic analysis of outsourcing in their stories ? not one .
Greg Mankiw thought a bunch of reporters were coming to talk to him about the state of the economy and the analysis made by the Council of Economic Advisers in its “ 2004 Economic Report of the President . ” But the last thing the reporters wanted to do was to convey a thumbnail summary of Mankiw ’ s analysis of outsourcing .
so does pleasing your editors so that they ’ ll give your stories better placement , and pleasing your sources so that they ’ ll keep talking to you . compared to these imperatives , there is little to be gained from informing the public about how the economy really functions and about the dilemmas of economic policy .
indeed , the economy is vastly inferior to Hollywood as a source of glitterati gossip , but much economic reporting makes the coverage of the birth of Brad Pitt ’ s and Angelina Jolie ’ s baby look profoundly serious . likewise , government is vastly inferior to the World Cup as a sporting spectacle , but much political reporting focuses on who played well and who played badly .
after all , few people go into journalism to deliberately mislead the public . if we demand better economic and political journalism the way we demand excellent coverage of the World Cup , we ’ ll get it .
the Tails Wagging the Kremlin Dog ?
now , suppose that same crank attempted to treat passersby as if they were his serfs . in that case , he would risk getting a beating , though perhaps a few beggars would indulge his fantasies in the hope of duping him out of his money .
something of this sort now characterizes relations between Russia and several former Soviet republics , for the foreign-policy doctrine that guides today ’ s Kremlin is a preposterous mix of nineteenth-century Realpolitik and early twentieth-century geopolitics . according to this view , every great power needs obedient satellite countries .
moreover , the constitutions of a number of CSTO countries expressly prohibit sending troops outside national territory . but the Kremlin ’ s myopic concentration on military matters , and its pointless attempts to play a zero-sum game with the West has turned Russia into an object for manipulation by its junior partners .
yet , despite all this , Lukashenko manages to avoid implementing economic projects profitable to Russia ( i.e. , a single currency ) . whenever Russia applies pressure , he immediately starts yelling about Moscow ’ s “ ingratitude ” – proclaiming that “ 10,000,000 Belarusians protect Russia from NATO ’ s tanks . ”
worse , whenever Moscow persists in its demands , Lukashenko abrogates agreements without a twinge of conscience . thus , when Russia banned imports of Belarusian dairy products ( in an attempt to punish Lukashenko for accepting a $ 2,000,000,000 credit but not fulfilling his promise to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia ) , Lukashenko refused to attend a CSTO summit or join its collective agreement for the establishment of an operational response force .
the most telling example is the creation of a joint air defense system . both Russia and Belarus have been trying to realize this project for ten years ; countless agreements have been achieved – on paper .
in the event that the coalition of NATO forces in Afghanistan is defeated , a wave of Islamic extremism will submerge the Central Asian states , inciting local civil wars . for Russia , this could mean ( in the best case ) tens of thousands of refugees or ( in the worst case ) the arrival of armed militias on its territory .
Kremlin strategists explained that they feared the US would oust Russia from Central Asia . but , now that a Russian-American agreement allows supply flights to Afghanistan to go through Russian airspace , it is clear that Russia sought only to monopolize the military cargo transportation routs in order to gain leverage over the United States .
in February , the Kremlin gave Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev $ 500 million for a promise to close America ’ s base in his country . then the Americans offered Bakiyev $ 160 million a year , and now there may be no official base , but a “ transit center ” that serves the same functions .
soon after this , Russian Vice Premier Igor Sechin and Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov were sent to Bishkek in an effort to get something for Russia ’ s money . Bakiyev seems to have said : so , you are worried about the American military presence in Central Asia , and you want to confront it .
the resulting “ military asset , ” however , is strategic gibberish , having been built in Kyrgyzstan ’ s near-lawless Osh region , with its appalling poverty , drug trafficking , and ethnic tensions . seizure of a Russian military base in order to acquire weapons is , indeed , likely to become a vital goal of “ extremists . ”
the Taliban Reborn
new DELHI – The lull in headline-grabbing terror attacks appears to be over . but do the recent suicide attack on the Bagram air base outside of Kabul , a key United States military installation in Afghanistan , and the failed car bombing in New York City ’ s Times Square mean that the “ war on terror ” ( a phrase that the Obama administration has deliberately sought to avoid ) has reignited ?
here is a simple formula for assessing a country ’ s approach to combating terrorism : credibility + transparency + integrity of approach = legitimacy and effectiveness . let us apply this formula to Pakistan .
analyzing the failed Times Square bombing , Ambassador Zafar Hilaly , a well-respected former Pakistani diplomat , wrote “ that nowhere else today have so many armed foreign outlaws been able to use the territory of a sovereign state to wage war for so long , and with such impunity , against other countries . &#91; those &#93; who roam … unchallenged have become … partners … in a war against the country itself . ”
a vast majority of Pakistan ’ s citizens deeply resent America ’ s presence and influence in their country . this growing alienation probably played a considerable part in US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying that deteriorating security in nuclear-armed Pakistan “ pose ( d ) a mortal ” threat to the US .
following the Times Square bombing attempt , Clinton issued an even harsher judgment : “ if a terror attack like the New York bombing were to be successful and found to have originated from that country , there would be very severe consequences . ” Clinton also said that Osama bin Laden ’ s whereabouts are known to “ some ” in Pakistan .
Eric Holder , the US attorney general , was even more explicit about the Times Square episode : “ We know that they ( the Pakistan Taliban ) helped direct it . and I suspect that we are going to come up with evidence that they helped to finance it .
US President Barack Obama has termed the Pakistan Taliban a “ cancer ” in the heart of Pakistan , and its origins are not shrouded in mystery . in December 2007 , about 13 militant groups came together to form the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , and chose Baitullah Mehsud as their leader .
the TTP has an estimated 30,000-35,000 adherents from all of Pakistan ’ s Federally Administered Tribal Areas , the near lawless regions where the writ of Pakistan ’ s government barely reaches . the TTP ’ s stated objectives include jihad against the Pakistani army , enforcement of sharia law across the country , and a plan to unite with the Afghan Taliban to fight the NATO forces in that country .
despite a supposed offensive by Pakistan ’ s government against the TTP in some of the tribal regions , a recent documentary reported that the group is now recruiting young children to carry out suicide attacks . indeed , there were nearly 60 suicide attacks in Pakistan in 2009 , compared to only two in 2002 .
given this analysis , however , Obama ’ s “ Afghanistan-oriented ” policy is doomed to failure . the US would certainly like Pakistan to eliminate the leadership of the Taliban , both Afghan and Pakistani , but will not lean too heavily on Pakistan ’ s rulers to accomplish this goal .
ambassador Hilaly has pointed to the way forward : “ To succeed today , it ( is ) essential that first and foremost the power of the armed groups within Pakistan be broken . without an all-out effort to do so , the terrorized population will not lend us support . ”
the Talmud and Greek Debt
there is , first , a pragmatic and short-term perspective , which focuses on ensuring some form of orderly restructuring ( possibly for other vulnerable European states as well ) without bringing down the eurozone . and there is a “ moral ” perspective , which focuses on the nature of debt and on the long-term economic consequences of failing to honor it .
neither perspective is wrong ; on the contrary , the problem is how to reconcile them . indeed , failure to do so appears to explain why the official response to the Greek debt crisis has been so inadequate .
in these circumstances , the Talmud , the ancient repository of Jewish legal commentary – and one of the oldest sources of human thought on morality and economic activity – might hold the key . an oft-quoted passage provides a fresh , if not exactly new , perspective on Greece ’ s debt and the best way to address it .
the passage concerns sales , divorces , and offerings , and specifies that these acts are legally valid only if a person performs them voluntarily . nevertheless , under certain circumstances , courts may force an individual until he says that he is , indeed , willing .
so , “ in divorces ( if the man refuses to grant it ) , we exercise force on him until he says ‘ I want to do it voluntarily . ’ ” Similarly , if a court forces a person to sell his property , the sale is valid because it is considered to have been carried out voluntarily .
understanding this apparent contradiction sheds light on the controversy surrounding the question of private bondholders ’ involvement in the Greek rescue package . it is argued that , to avoid a default , private creditors should agree to shoulder part of the cost of the bailout .
one could dismiss this dispute as being mere rhetoric . but , using the Talmudic logic , one can also show that there are mechanisms that can – and should – be used to place pressure on the parties in the interest of obtaining superior voluntary outcomes .
one argues that coercion can change minds . when a court forces an individual until he surrenders and says that he wants to follow orders , his compliant actions are to be considered voluntary , because , ultimately , he has made the conscious decision to agree .
while technically correct , this is a ruthless interpretation , since this type of “ willing ” behavior is bound to leave resentment .
a more benign interpretation , based on the collective-action principle , envisages the court as instrumental in attaining a superior welfare equilibrium . individuals know fundamentally what is good for them and for society , but they are often hesitant to act accordingly , owing to fear , embarrassment , or , very often , the belief that their actions will not be worthwhile if others do not follow in their footsteps .
the court , according to this view , provides the coordinating mechanism , eliminating free riders and forcing all parties to an outcome that makes everybody better off . thus , individual decisions , though extracted under pressure , become , when assessing the outcome , truly voluntary .
seen in this light , unilateral schemes , such as the original German proposal ( forcing maturities on Greek debt to be voluntarily extended for several years ) are only voluntary under the ruthless interpretation . in initiatives of this sort , agreement is obtained reluctantly and pressure could provoke harsh responses .
the alternative is to seek a cooperative resolution , consistent with the benign interpretation of “ forced willingness . ” This can be achieved by adopting some features of the model used in Eastern Europe , known as the “ Vienna Initiative . ”
some of the current proposal to deal “ voluntarily ” with the Greek debt goes some way in this direction . but the initiative is insufficient , because the three pillars of the Vienna model are basically missing .
the first pillar of that model is simultaneous involvement of all parties – the sovereign , bondholders and their governments , the European Central Bank , and international organizations – in designing the scheme from the start . the second ingredient is proper incentives to participate , including direct financing from bondholders ’ governments , using the resources that today finance the transfer of Greek debt from private to official hands .
since this scheme would imply losses for bondholders , substantial official muscle and peer pressure is needed . but gaining time for a more orderly resolution , mitigating contagion , and reducing the size of an eventual write-down do indeed add up to a superior outcome .
therefore , under this model – and despite the initial pressure – the behavior of bondholders could be considered truly voluntary . and , while rating agencies might still regard a Vienna-type outcome as a default , the Talmudic sages show us why a more thoughtful classification is required .
the Tea Party ’ s Modest Proposal
this is factually incorrect – US government securities remain one of the safest investments in the world – but the claim serves the purpose of dramatizing the federal budget and creating a great deal of hysteria around America ’ s current debt levels . this then produces the fervent belief that government spending must be cut radically , and now .
there are legitimate fiscal issues that demand serious discussion , including how to control growth in health-care spending and how best to structure tax reform . but the Tea Party faction of the Republican Party cares more about small government than anything else : its members insist , above all , that federal tax revenue never be permitted to exceed 18 % of GDP .
since the prolonged showdown over the budget began earlier this year , the stock market has lost about 20 % of its value ( roughly $ 10 trillion ) . in effect , the Tea Party is working hard to reduce publicly funded social benefits – including pensions and Medicare – even as its methods dramatically reduce the value of private wealth now and in the future .
part of the Tea Party ’ s founding myth , of course , is that smaller government will lead to faster growth and greater prosperity for all . never mind that the eye-popping growth projections in Representative Paul Ryan ’ s budget plan , for example , are utterly implausible ; these projections matter politically , because , without them , the full sting of Ryan ’ s proposed Medicare cuts would be readily apparent .
confrontation and brinkmanship have become the new watchwords of American politics , even when the US government ’ s legal ability to pay its debts is on the line , owing to the Tea Party ’ s ideological rigidity . and the tone of political debate , not surprisingly , has become much nastier .
so , while a budget deal would technically be easy to achieve , it looks politically impossible in the near term . indeed , while Congress and the Republican Party have become less popular during 2011 , support for the Tea Party has remained remarkably constant , at around 30 % of the population .
perhaps the most damaging outcome of these tactics is to take countercyclical fiscal policy off the table completely . regardless of what happens to the global economy in the weeks and months ahead , it is inconceivable that any kind of meaningful fiscal stimulus would get through the House of Representatives .
it remains to be seen whether the US Federal Reserve will also feel constrained by the political mood on Capitol Hill . clearly , influential Tea Party supporters would strongly resist any attempt now by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke to find unorthodox ways to run a more expansionary monetary policy .
and , as for protecting the financial system against disaster , the current majority on the House Financial Services Committee is clear – they favor use of the bankruptcy system when megabanks get into serious trouble . if the eurozone crisis continues to spiral out of control , the US should expect to see Lehman or near-Lehman-type collapses among exposed financial institutions .
the irony of the Tea Party revolt , of course , is that it undermines the private sector more than it reins in “ big government . ” The S &amp; amp ; P downgrade resulted in a “ flight to quality , ” meaning that investors bought US government debt – thus increasing its price and lowering the rate that the federal government pays to borrow .
the government part of the credit system has been strengthened , relatively speaking , by developments over the past few months . it is the private sector – where investment and entrepreneurial activity are needed to generate growth and employment – that has taken a beating .
unless and until America ’ s private sector recovers , investment and job creation will continue to stagnate . but today ’ s atmosphere of fear and aggressive budget tactics are combining to undermine private-sector confidence and spending power .
as Jonathan Swift put it in 1727 , “ Party is the madness of many , for the gain of the few . ”
the Terror Next Door .
deep and sustained anger across the country – at its demonstrated vulnerability to terror and at the multiple institutional failures that allowed such loss of life – has prompted the resignations of the Home Minister in the national government and the Chief Minister and his Deputy in the state of Maharashtra , of which Mumbai is the capital . as evidence mounts that the attacks were planned and directed from Pakistani territory , calls for decisive action have intensified .
they caused death and destruction to Indians with near-impunity , searing India ’ s psyche , showing up the limitations of its security apparatus and humiliating its government . they dented the worldwide image of India as an emerging economic giant , a success story of the era of globalization and an increasing magnet for investors and tourists .
the Pakistani military finds militant outfits useful tools to bleed their adversaries in India and Afghanistan , and has shown little inclination to clamp down on them , despite years of assurances that action would be taken to curb their activities . in July this year , American intelligence sources publicly revealed that the suicide-bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul had been conducted at the behest of the ISI .
so if the US and India demand , as they will , that Pakistan disband the Lashkar and similar terrorist outfits that have enjoyed military patronage in the past , dismantle their training facilities , freeze their bank accounts ( before they are simply transferred to another name ) and arrest their leaders , they will face a typically Pakistani conundrum : the military isn ’ t willing , and the civilian government isn ’ t able .
India ’ s government , which has reacted to previous terrorist outrages with calm and restraint , has no choice this time but to respond decisively . anything that smacks of temporizing and appeasement will further inflame the public a few months before national elections are due .
but India ’ s government has few good options . an earlier assault on India ’ s Parliament in December 2001 by the Pakistan-based militant organization Jaish-e-Muhammad , nearly triggered a full-scale war between the two countries . &amp; nbsp ; In the end India pulled back its deployment on the border .
though some hotheads in India now call for military action , including strikes on terrorist facilities in Pakistani territory , this would certainly lead to a war that neither side could win . if anything , such an Indian reaction would play into the hands of the terrorists , by strengthening anti-Indian nationalism in Pakistan and diverting forces away from the Afghan borderlands , where they are aiding NATO ’ s fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
for this reason , the US is likely to press India not to contemplate forceful retaliation that could undermine America ’ s objectives in Afghanistan . and since both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons , the risk of military action spiralling out of control is too grave for any responsible government to contemplate .
so India is likely to ask the US to use its undoubted clout with Pakistan – the US is a huge donor of both military and economic assistance to its near-bankrupt ally – to demand tougher action against the militants on its territory . the governments of the victims of the Mumbai massacre are also likely to demand accountability from Islamabad .
contemplating such options , the world may be forced to admit its impotence . that will have a chilling result : as long as a military-dominated Pakistan continues , willingly or helplessly , to harbour the perpetrators of Islamist terror , what happened in Mumbai could happen again -- anywhere .
the Terror Next Door
London – In a prominent hadith , the Prophet Mohammed said : “ If disorder threatens , take refuge in Yemen . ” The Prophet was referring to the prosperous and civilized Yemen . but today disorder and radicalization in Yemen are beginning to infect Saudi Arabia , and thus the safety of the world ’ s largest oil producer .
the Prophet ’ s hadith about Yemen has enjoyed new resonance ever since the 1980 ’ s , when Saudi Arabia – in line with American policy – sought to export domestic dissenters , most prominently Osama bin Laden , a Yemeni of Saudi birth , to fight Soviet infidels in Afghanistan . although dissent was mostly diverted to Afghanistan , bin Laden ’ s most trusted companions ( his wife , too ) have remained mainly in Yemen .
in the wake of the Taliban ’ s ouster in Afghanistan , bin Laden and his followers have come to regard Yemen , alongside Pakistan , as a haven . indeed , Yemen is now a bubbling cauldron of jihadis who have flocked there because it , like Afghanistan and Pakistan , has weak , easily manipulated state institutions .
US President Barack Obama ’ s recent order to shut down the Guantánamo Bay detention facility has made the problem of Yemen ’ s weakness a leading international issue . one-third of the Guantánamo detainees are Yemeni , but Yemen cannot guarantee the United States that the detainees will be controlled effectively if they are returned home .
Saudi Arabia , unlike Yemen , has supposedly created a “ model ” system for reintegrating and re-educating Guantánamo returnees . the Al Munasaha rehabilitation center is supposed to “ cure ” jihadi passions , and Saudi returnees from Guantánamo who spend time at Al Munasaha are later offered jobs and wives .
most notorious among these recidivists is Abu Sufyan Al Shihri , now “ Deputy Leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . ” Seven other Saudi jihadis who escaped to Yemen are also known to be active in Al Qaeda there .
thus the two largest countries on the Arabian peninsula – Saudi Arabia , the biggest in terms of landmass and oil wealth , and Yemen in terms of population – are now locked in life-and-death struggles with internal enemies . the paradox is that , though the threat to both countries is the same , each is worsening the outlook for the other by the policies they are pursuing .
but in 1991 , 800,000 Yemenis were expelled because they were seen as a domestic security threat in the run-up to the first Gulf war . since then , Yemeni labor has been banned from Saudi Arabia .
embittered and unemployed , young Yemeni men often become subject to another Saudi policy gone awry – its propagation for export of the Sunni Wahhabi form of Islam . with new Wahhabi madrasas popping up everywhere in Yemen because of Saudi financial support , it is small wonder that the number of Yemeni jihadis has grown exponentially .
but Yemen , too , is engaged in its own destructive policies . President Ali Abdullah Salih has regularly used Yemeni Wahhabis to defeat his domestic opponents – first the Communists , then the Zaidis , and then the Huthis .
Saudi Arabia ’ s relationship with Yemen is unlike that with any other Arab country . the two countries are joined through historical , ethnic , and tribal ties , yet neither has the means to resolve popular resentments and resistance .
Saudi Arabia ’ s traditional “ soft power ” foreign policy tools – lavish spending of oil money and da ’ wa , “ the Call ” – are no longer effective . building fences and sending helicopters to police the borders will not be sufficient , and the idea that jihadis can be rehabilitated is a myth .
yet there are things the Saudis can do to vaccinate themselves , and Yemen , from fanaticism . the tentative moves toward liberalization that King Abdullah has made over the past two years need to be accelerated , made more daring , and become more effective in removing the Wahhabi ideology as an incubator for radicalism .
this should not be impossible , because both Saudi Arabia and Yemen have moderate , indigenous Islamic traditions that can be mobilized against jihadism . if given the financial support that the Wahhabis received , these forces could reverse the current drift to fanaticism .
the first change is economic . instead of exporting radicalism , Saudi Arabia must start importing Yemeni manpower by lifting its ban on Yemeni workers .
Yemeni officials have also requested admission to the Gulf Cooperation Council . up to now , GCC leaders have spurned Yemen ’ s membership for the same reasons that the European Union fears admitting Turkey : Yemen would instantly become the bloc ’ s most populous country .
indeed , Yemen ’ s population exceeds that of all six GCC members – Qatar , Kuwait , the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Oman , and Saudi Arabia – combined . but if Yemen ’ s masses are not to become more radicalized , they will need to be incorporated into an economic zone that offers hope for the future .
Yemen is strategically important , not only for Saudi Arabia , but for the world , because it is the only country on the Arabian Peninsula from which oil can reach the open seas without passing through a narrow strait – either the Strait of Hormuz or the Suez Canal . to endanger this passage is to endanger the world economy ’ s energy lifeline .
when considering Yemen ’ s future , therefore , the stakes could hardly be higher .
the Threat of German Amnesia
who would have thought that British Prime Minister David Cameron would call on eurozone governments to muster the courage to create a fiscal union ( with a common budget and tax policy and jointly guaranteed public debt ) ? and Cameron also argues that deeper political integration is the only way to stop the breakup of the euro .
a conservative British prime minister ! the European house is ablaze , and Downing Street is calling for a rational and resolute response by the fire brigade .
unfortunately , the fire brigade is being led by Germany , and its chief is Chancellor Angela Merkel . as a result , Europe continues to try to quench the fire with gasoline – German-enforced austerity – with the consequence that , in a mere three years , the eurozone ’ s financial crisis has become a European existential crisis .
let ’ s not delude ourselves : if the euro falls apart , so will the European Union ( the world ’ s largest economy ) , triggering a global economic crisis on a scale that most people alive today have never experienced . Europe is on the edge of an abyss , and will surely tumble into it unless Germany – and France – alters course .
the recent elections in France and Greece , together with local elections in Italy and continuing unrest in Spain and Ireland , have shown that the public has lost faith in the strict austerity forced upon them by Germany . Merkel ’ s kill-to-cure remedy has run up against reality – and democracy .
we are once again learning the hard way that this kind of austerity , when applied in the teeth of a major financial crisis , leads only to depression . this insight should have been common knowledge ; it was , after all , a major lesson of the austerity policies of President Herbert Hoover in the United States and Chancellor Heinrich Brüning in Weimar Germany in the early 1930 ’ s .
and then ? should we write off what more than two generations of Europeans have created – a massive investment in institution-building that has led to the longest period of peace and prosperity in the history of the continent ?
one thing is certain : a breakup of the euro and the EU would entail Europe ’ s exit from the world stage . Germany ’ s current policy is all the more absurd in view of the bitter political and economic consequences that it would face .
it is up to Germany and France , Merkel and President François Hollande , to decide the future of our continent . Europe ’ s salvation now depends on a fundamental change in Germany ’ s economic-policy stance , and in France ’ s position on political integration and structural reforms .
France will have to say yes to a political union : a common government with common parliamentary control for the eurozone . the eurozone ’ s national governments already are acting in unison as a de facto government to address the crisis .
Germany , for its part , will have to opt for a fiscal union . ultimately , that means guaranteeing the eurozone ’ s survival with Germany ’ s economic might and assets : unlimited acquisition of the crisis countries ’ government bonds by the European Central Bank , Europeanization of national debts via Eurobonds , and growth programs to avoid a eurozone depression and boost recovery .
one can easily imagine the ranting in Germany about this kind of program : still more debt ! loss of control over our assets !
if China and America had not pumped partly debt-financed money into their economies beginning in 2009 , the German economy would have taken a serious hit . Germans must now ask themselves whether they , who have profited the most from European integration , are willing to pay the price for it or would prefer to let it fail .
beyond political and fiscal unification and short-term growth policies , Europeans urgently need structural reforms aimed at restoring Europe ’ s competitiveness . each of these pillars is needed if Europe is to overcome its existential crisis .
hardly anyone understands our dogmatic austerity policy , which goes against all experience , and we are considered largely off-course , if not heading into oncoming traffic . it is still not too late to change direction , but now we have only days and weeks , perhaps months , rather than years .
only in this manner – reflected most vividly in its embrace of the European project – did Germany win consent for its reunification . it would be both tragic and ironic if a restored Germany , by peaceful means and with the best of intentions , brought about the ruin of the European order a third time .
Europe ’ s New Jewish Question
new YORK – In March 1936 , Poland ’ s Sejm ( the lower house of parliament ) almost succeeded in outlawing shechita ( slaughter according to Jewish law ) . only the Polish Constitution prevented an outright ban .
a few days ago , the ghosts of the past returned to the Sejm , when deputies rejected a government bill intended to keep religious slaughter legal . even many of the bill ’ s supporters ( including Prime Minister Donald Tusk ) were concerned not with defending the rights of religious minorities , but rather with protecting meatpacking jobs .
yet the Sejm ’ s decision raises the question : do Poles really want Jewish life to return to their country ? or do they see Poland ’ s Jewish legacy only as something that benefits their tourism and food industries ?
but almost every Jew will defend the right of others to live according to Jewish dietary laws . shechita is an indispensable , non-negotiable part of Jewish religious life .
such populist measures are vote winners . the civil rights of small religious minorities do not matter much politically ; the perceived rights of animals ( and economic motivations ) do .
as The Economist noted succinctly , “ Poland is not a country hitherto known for championing animal rights . ” Indeed , it is hypocritical that hunting for sport and unsupervised home slaughtering continue to be permitted , whereas shechita , which is carried out by experienced people according to well-established procedures , is not .
granted , the term sounds archaic ; but the Torah is the first systematic legislation that forbids cruelty to animals and mandates that they be treated with consideration and respect . those who argue that ritual slaughter is “ foreign ” to Polish culture not only know nothing about their country ’ s history ; they also exploit and reinforce anti-Semitic sentiment .
Poland is not the only place where established religious practices are being questioned . in other Western countries , such as Germany , France , the Netherlands , and New Zealand , heated debates about religious slaughter and circumcision have taken place recently .
a year ago , a German judge ruled that religious circumcision was a cruel practice that inflicted bodily harm on boys and was therefore illegal – a view supported by many commentators in the media . but German politicians strove to find a solution that accommodated the concerns of the Jewish and Muslim minorities .
in the Netherlands , a covenant was signed that allowed religious slaughter . it received the backing of the legislature , which had previously favored a ban .
likewise , in Poland , following a Constitutional Court ruling in November 2012 that struck down on technical grounds a provision permitting religious slaughter , the government promised that the practice would remain legal . yet when legislators voted on the government ’ s bill earlier this month , following a sometimes-hysterical debate on ritual slaughter in the media , three dozen deputies from Tusk ’ s Civic Platform , the largest faction in the Sejm , opposed it .
if not halted , such measures could call into question the Jewish presence on the Continent in the longer term . yet Tusk has ruled out a reversal of the ban , and one of his ministers asked the Jewish and Muslim communities to challenge it before the Constitutional Court .
the relationship between Central and Eastern European countries and the Jewish people has always been characterized by both triumph and tragedy . in recent years , it has been strengthening , especially in Poland .
a few months ago , I participated in the March of the Living at Auschwitz . many Jews with European roots who now live in America or Israel were in attendance .
but now I am left wondering : can the Jewish renaissance in the heart of Europe continue if essential elements of Jewish life are declared illegal ? or will Europe ’ s leaders stand up for the civil rights of their Jewish compatriots ?
as Pinchas Goldschmidt , President of the Conference of European Rabbis , recently remarked , one cannot be proud of the Jews of yesterday and tell the Jews of today that their religious practices are no longer welcome . the Jewish heritage is part of Europe ’ s heritage .
the Three Swedish Models
Sweden ’ s economic and social system , sometimes called the “ Swedish Model , ” is often depicted either as an ideal or an abnormality . but Sweden ’ s system has varied considerably .
as late as 1960 , both total government spending ( as a share of GDP ) and the distribution of earnings were similar to those prevailing in the United States . during this century-long period , Sweden moved from being one of the poorest western countries to being the third richest country in terms of GDP per capita .
the free-trade regime of the liberal period was retained during this period – indeed it was deepened by the various rounds of global trade liberalization – but the dominant thrust was the creation of a generous welfare state . by the late 1980 ’ s , total public spending reached 60-65 % of GDP , compared to about 30 % in 1960 .
economic incentives to work , save , and start businesses were also reduced through the compression of wage differentials and a big squeeze on company profits , both largely the result of strong and centralized labor unions . moreover , new labor-market regulations were introduced , the most important being strict job-security legislation implemented in the early 1970 ’ s .
this can partly be explained by the “ catch up ” mechanism , as technologically less advanced countries imported technology from more advanced countries . but this does not explain why 14 countries not only caught up with Sweden during this period , but surpassed it in terms of GDP per capita .
these reforms had broad political support and were , in fact , initiated during a social-democratic government . subsequently , mainly during a period of center-right governance , several product markets were deregulated : telecommunications , electricity , road transport , taxis , and , to some extent , railways .
a process of deregulation and privatization , although with continued tax-financing ( in fact , basically a voucher system ) , began in the field of “ human services , ” in particular for childcare , education , and old-age care . one purpose of this was to increase competition and freedom of choice .
the government has announced plans to privatize state-owned companies , improve conditions for small firms , and continue increasing individual freedom of choice in the case of human services . it has also abolished the wealth tax ( after the previous social-democratic government had already abolished the inheritance tax ) .
moreover , the government has modestly reduced taxes on wages and slightly scaled down the generosity of some benefits . one argument for the latter policy is to improve the government ’ s budget , another to make work more economically rewarding relative to government benefits .
first , all political parties agree that welfare-state arrangements should remain tax-financed , although possibly with a stronger application of insurance principles in the social insurance systems . so even if the generosity of state benefits may be curtailed , aggregate government spending is unlikely to be rolled back dramatically from the current 53 % of GDP .
second , there is general agreement that the government should take more active responsibility for environmental issues , although policies in this area increasingly rely on market instruments ( prices for environmental disturbances ) rather than on quantitative regulations
clearly , some of these policy measures may conflict with traditional egalitarianism in Sweden , at least in the short term . hence , the big question underlying the current wave of liberalization is whether these reform tendencies are politically sustainable .
betting on the Tortoise in Japan
Cambridge – In April 2014 , Japan ’ s consumption-tax rate is set to rise from 5 % to 8 % in an effort to address the long-term problem of high public debt . but will the resulting loss in purchasing power bring an end to the Japanese economy ’ s fragile recovery , as many fear ?
as the date drew near , I asked Summers why he persisted in offering Japan ’ s leaders this unwanted advice , given that they were clearly locked in politically . Summers told me that he knew he was unlikely to change anyone ’ s mind , but that he wanted to be sure that Japanese officials recognized their mistake when they went ahead with the increase .
the economy is weak , but the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) cannot make monetary policy much more expansionary than it already is . and , while fiscal stimulus is called for in the short run , the long-term outlook for Japan ’ s public finances is deeply troublesome , owing to the huge debts run up in the past .
what is required is easy fiscal policy today , together with plans to achieve fiscal rectitude in the long run . the difficulty with this Augustinian approach – “ Lord , make me chaste , but not yet ” – is that promises of future discipline usually are not credible .
given this , governments should provide specific fiscal-consolidation mechanisms that are visibly likely to take effect when the time comes . raising the retirement age for future pension benefits qualifies as such a mechanism .
in normal times , central banks want to reduce inflation . the problem is that pre-announced hikes in tax rates or administered prices can have the undesirable effect of building annual price increases into public perceptions , undermining the central bank ’ s inflation-fighting efforts .
the most important component of “ Abenomics ” this year has been the BOJ ’ s efforts to ease monetary conditions further , despite zero interest rates , and thus end the threat of deflation . under these circumstances , inflation expectations are not a cause for concern .
the US could legislate a pre-announced path of slow but steady increases in energy or carbon taxes ( accompanied by immediate short-term offsets , such as a reduction in the distortionary payroll tax or an end to the damaging spending sequester ) . as in Japan , such measures would enhance long-run fiscal sustainability without weakening demand at a time when the economy has not yet fully recovered from the Great Recession .
in addition , the environmental and national-security arguments in favor of discouraging fossil-fuel consumption work better if the increase in energy prices is phased in gradually . that way , people have sufficient time to make effective decisions about automobiles , home heating systems , power plants , research into new technologies , and so forth .
countries like India and Indonesia are now facing possible financial crises , in part owing to large budget deficits , a major component of which has long been food and energy subsidies . keeping domestic prices for food and energy artificially low has proved to be not only ruinously expensive , but also very ineffective in achieving the declared goal of helping to alleviate poverty .
a credible , pre-announced phase-out path would provide much-needed reassurance to skittish global investors , without imposing immediate hardship on the poor . at the same time , the ability to plan ahead in anticipation of the price increases would allow more effective responses , as farmers plant different crops , manufacturers switch to more energy-efficient equipment , and so forth .
governments worldwide face a similar imperative : maintain policy credibility without undermining economic recovery . bold measures like those envisaged by Abenomics may help .
Li Keqiang ’ s Bottom Line
last year , Chinese GDP growth reached a 13-year low , and no upturn is in sight . but , as Premier Li Keqiang seems to recognize , this trend could actually be beneficial , spurring the structural reforms that China needs to achieve its longer-term goal of more balanced and stable GDP growth .
in its latest Global Economic Prospects report , the World Bank cut its 2013 economic growth forecast for China from 8.4 % to 7.7 % . moreover , recently released central-bank data show that Chinese banks increased their lending by only about ¥ 667 billion ( $ 108 billion ) in May – a roughly ¥ 125 billion decline from the same period last year .
given that outstanding loans already amount to nearly double China ’ s GDP – a result of the country ’ s massive stimulus since 2008 – new loans are largely being used to pay off old debts , rather than for investment in the real economy . thus , the more relevant concern is that the balance of outstanding loans has not risen .
the key to restoring China ’ s GDP growth is , therefore , returning fixed-asset investment growth to at least 25 % . with a new round of stimulus , China ’ s excess production capacity and underused outlays ( for example , built-up real-estate assets ) could be mobilized immediately , restoring 9 % annual GDP growth .
but the willingness of China ’ s new leadership to initiate another round of growth-securing stimulus depends on what rate of GDP growth Li can tolerate . with China ’ s leaders having offered no indication that they will change current monetary policy , some economists have estimated that Li will not act until GDP growth falls below 7 % .
in 2005 , China was experiencing currency appreciation , which , as other fast-growing economies in East Asia have demonstrated , can stimulate the government and businesses to pursue structural reforms and industrial upgrading . but the subsequent increase in official fixed-asset investment – which rose by 32 % in 2009 alone – delayed structural reforms , while over-capacity and a real-estate bubble became even larger and more deeply entrenched problems .
the government must now dispel the remaining vestiges of the stimulus-fueled over-investment of 2008-2010 , however painful it may be . this means allowing the economy to continue to slow , while maintaining relatively tight macroeconomic policies that force local governments and the business sector to find new sources of growth .
for example , firms in China ’ s export-dependent coastal regions have been burdened by renminbi appreciation since 2004 . when the economic slowdown hastened the relocation of many manufacturers to inland provinces or neighboring countries , those in the coastal regions began to call for increased openness , deeper structural reforms , and industrial upgrading .
the view that Li will tolerate slower growth only above a particular threshold is based on the belief that GDP growth below 8 % would hurt economic development more than it helped , and lead to social instability . and , indeed , if unemployment pressure had become as acute today as it was in the 1990 ’ s , the prolonged economic slowdown would undoubtedly have precipitated government intervention .
but , over the last decade , structural changes to China ’ s economy have caused unemployment pressure to decline significantly – a trend that can be corroborated by across-the-board wage increases .
the Trade-and-Aid Myth
more aid ( including debt relief ) and greater access to rich countries ’ markets for poor countries ’ products now appears to be at the top of the global agenda . indeed , the debate nowadays is not about what to do , but howmuch to do , and how fast .
foremost among these is that economic development is largely in the hands of poor nations themselves . countries that have done well in the recent past have done so through their own efforts .
consider a developing country that has free and preferential market access to its largest neighbor , which also happens to be the world ’ s most powerful economy . suppose , in addition , that this country is able to send millions of its citizens to work across the border , receives a huge volume of inward investment , and is totally integrated into international production chains .
as the reader may have guessed , these are real countries : Mexico and Vietnam . Mexico shares a 2,000-mile long border with the United States , which provides not only privileged market access in goods and labor , but also a claim to the resources of the US Treasury ( as became apparent during the 1995 peso crisis ) .
by contrast , America maintained a trade embargo against Vietnam until 1994 , established diplomatic relations only in 1995 , and did not provide most-favored nation treatment to Vietnamese imports for years after that . Vietnam still remains outside the WTO .
since NAFTA was signed in December 1992 , Mexico ’ s economy has grown at an average annual rate of barely over 1 % in per capita terms . this is not only far below the rates of Asia ’ s economic superstars ; it is also a fraction of Mexico ’ s own growth performance during the decades that preceded the debt crisis of 1982 ( 3.6 % per year between 1960 and 1981 ) .
Vietnam , however , grew at an annual rate of 5.6 % per capita between the onset of its economic reforms in 1988 and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the US in 1995 , and has continued to grow at a rapid 4.5 % pace since then . Vietnam witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty , while in Mexico real wages fell .
what these examples show is that domestic efforts trump everything else in determining a country ’ s economic fortunes . all the opportunities that the US market presented to Mexico could not offset the consequences of policy mistakes at home , especially the failure to reverse the real appreciation of the peso ’ s exchange rate and the inability to extend the productivity gains achieved in a narrow range of export activities to the rest of the economy .
what matters most is whether a country adopts the right growth strategy . with none of Mexico ’ s advantages , Vietnam pursued a strategy that focused on diversifying its economy and enhancing the productive capacity of domestic suppliers .
broader post-war experience supports the conclusion that domestic policies are what matter most . South Korea took off in the early 1960 ’ s not when foreign aid was at its apex , but when it was being phased out .
it is tempting to ascribe the rare African successes – Botswana and Mauritius – to foreign demand for their exports ( diamonds and garments , respectively ) , but that story goes only so far . obviously , both countries would be considerably poorer without access to foreign markets .
the word “ diamond ” hardly conjures images of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone . similarly , few of the export processing zones proliferating around the world have delivered the results observed in Mauritius .
they can make the world less hospitable for corrupt dictators – for example , by greater sharing of financial information and by not recognizing the international contracts that they sign . similarly , increasing the number of poor-country workers allowed to work in rich countries , and providing greater scope for growth-oriented policies by relaxing WTO rules and conditionality from the US , would produce greater long-term development impact .
it is far from clear that expanding market access and boosting aid are the most productive use of valuable political capital in the North . development should focus not on trade and aid , but on improving the policy environment in poor countries .
the Tragedy of President Chen
Taiwan ’ s Public Prosecutor has indicted the wife of President Chen Shui-bien for embezzling public funds . Chen , as a sitting president , cannot be indicted even though the prosecutor says that he has evidence to prove his guilt .
the root of Chen ’ s moral demise is something the classical Greeks identified : hubris . Chen ’ s popularity among his party followers , whose fervency often bordered on fundamentalism , changed him from a person with deep democratic instincts into a textbook case of a man who regards power and its prerogatives as being his by right .
Chen once had political courage . jailed years ago for his anti-Kuomintang ( KMT ) activities , he stood up at great odds to the Chinese Communist Party , which sought in vain to subjugate him in cross-Strait relations and in global politics .
the world has largely deserted Taiwan and its 23 million people – the only democracy among 1.2 billion Chinese . only 24 countries , mostly tiny island states , maintain diplomatic relations , while all but one of the world ’ s major powers and all important international institutions , including the United Nations , dance to the mainland ’ s tune on the issue .
but Chen ’ s behavior did not help . indeed , he even angered the United States , Taiwan ’ s only military protector , by his frequent confrontational tactics , such as pushing Taiwan towards independence , which runs counter to America ’ s longstanding “ One-China ” policy .
after winning the presidency , Chen could have risen above theatrics by focusing on two Taiwanese strengths : its economy and its unbroken humanist Chinese cultural tradition .
instead , Chen balked at further integration into the global economy , refusing to open all of Taiwan ’ s economic sectors to foreign participation , which would have strengthened Taiwan ’ s competitiveness and efficiency . for years , forward looking Taiwanese industrialists , including many hi-tech entrepreneurs , urged Chen to de-bureaucratize and de-politicize Taiwan ’ s increasingly isolated economy .
unwisely , Chen went out of his way to shut out mainland Chinese capital and to retain barriers to other foreign investors in order to protect the domestic businesses of his political allies .
indeed , indicators of economic freedom and competitiveness compiled by the Heritage Foundation , the Cato Institute , the World Economic Forum , and others show that Taiwan ’ s relative ranking has stagnated or even declined on Chen ’ s watch . this stands in sharp contrast to the communist mainland , which has reinvented itself to become one of world ’ s more open , competitive , and dynamic economies .
as a result , big international corporations and Wall Street banks now flock to China , bypassing Taiwan . they do so not because Taiwan is small – witness Hong Kong and Switzerland – but because it retains too many restrictions against foreign institutions .
Taiwan ’ s missed opportunity reflects its government ’ s sheer incompetence , arrogance , and ignorance . Chen squandered six valuable years as his administration engaged mainly in polemics with its opposition parties while he pandered to the extreme wing of the DPP and mobilized his government to “ de-Sinicize ” Taiwan culture .
he ordered the Education Ministry to revise school textbooks to promote the idea that the Taiwanese people were fundamentally different , practically a different race from the Chinese . clearly , Chen ’ s hatred of dictatorship , whether Communist or KMT , consumed him , limiting his ability to think clearly .
in fact , Taiwan ’ s moral superiority over mainland China lies not only in its democratic institutions , but also in its unbroken adherence to the ancient culture that the Chinese communists nearly succeeded in annihilating after coming to power in 1949 . ironically , it is China ’ s rulers who are now scrambling to resurrect Confucius as a moral anchor in a culture dominated by the pursuit of money .
Chen should have celebrated Taiwan ’ s “ Chineseness ” proudly and loudly , thereby distinguishing the island from the barbaric legacy of the Chinese Communist Party . instead , Chen ’ s futile effort to “ de-Sinicize ” Taiwan created a wastefully divisive contentious society , pitting “ mainlanders ” and “ locals ” against each other .
their close aides have confessed that they forged documents and perjured themselves to protect their political boss . what a pathetic ending for a man who could have become one of the most important leaders in modern Chinese history .
the Tragedy of Trade Blindness
this is a tragedy in the making , because the gains available from what has already been agreed upon in the negotiations are considerable , and would provide a major boost to the global economy . failure would thus constitute a serious indictment of political leaders in major trading countries in both the developed and developing worlds , possibly costing the global economy $ 700 billion in additional annual income .
by contrast , if the Round is completed , aside from this generalized gain , specific and important improvements would benefit the world ’ s least developed countries . the European Union , for example , has already agreed that all such countries will be afforded duty- and quota-free market access for their exports .
but probably none will be realized if the general agreement completing the Round is not concluded . for the rule governing global trade rounds is that nothing is deliverable until everything is agreed .
moreover , completing the Doha Round is crucial for the World Trade Organization . Brazil ’ s ambassador to the WTO , Roberto Azevedo , said recently that his country “ rejects the notion that this organization ’ s credibility and legitimacy are in a death embrace with the Round .
of course , he is right : even if the Doha Round fails , the WTO will survive . but it would be no minor event , and it would take years for the organization to recover .
indeed , all previous trade rounds – even the Uruguay Round , which took eight years to complete – concluded favorably . to pretend that the Doha Round ’ s failure would not have negative and lasting effects for the WTO betrays a profound lack of understanding of the risks we run , as well as of the Round ’ s vital importance for weaker and smaller states .
either the Round will fail outright , or some parts of it will be salvaged , with the rest ( most of the areas under negotiation ) put to one side amid promises to return to them after the 2012 elections in the United States . either way , the consequences promise to be far-reaching .
during the last 20 years , the world has witnessed dramatic proliferation of regional and bilateral preferential trade agreements . indeed , bilateral trade flows covered by such agreements now amount to roughly half of the world ’ s imports , and have contributed significantly to the dramatic growth of trade .
there is a big difference between multilateral negotiations of universal rules and the effective imposition of rules – and even concessions – in a negotiation between the EU or the US and a smaller trade partner . while large developing countries – such as Brazil , Russia , India , and China – can avoid such impositions from developed economies , most others cannot .
aside from the great damage caused by unequal bargaining power outside of the multilateral framework , the path of bilateral negotiations threatens to remove the focus from universal outcomes , which are the bedrock of globalization . the basic principle of non-discrimination is at risk : once trading countries negotiate separately with each other , various forms of discrimination become inevitable , giving rise to various kinds of conflicts .
the gradual marginalization of the WTO would also erode its credibility in fulfilling its key role as adjudicator of trade disputes . the success of the WTO ’ s adjudication system is reflected in its widespread acceptance .
this constitutes a remarkable advance in global governance . but it will be endangered if the credibility of the WTO is damaged by a Doha Round failure .
the primary responsibility for completing the Round now rests with the US , Brazil , China , and India . this group ’ s inflexibility is at the root of the current impasse , and , should the Round fail ,
they will all , of course , have their own excuses and blame everyone but themselves .
the US administration ’ s heart has not been in this negotiation for a long time . however foolish that stance may be , it is even harder to understand why China , Brazil , and India have not made a more determined effort .
the threat to the globalization process may not be immediately apparent , but it is very real . the failure of the Doha Round would be more than a footnote in future history books ; it would be a hugely consequential case of political myopia at a time of great opportunity .
most distressing of all , even now , with the consequences of failure staring our political leaders in the face , they do not get it .
the Tragedy of Zidane
after France barely survived the tournament ’ s first round , Zidane performed at the top of his game and led the team to the brink of a second World Cup championship . but instead of finishing his career in triumph , or at least with an ovation , he was ejected from the final for head-butting an Italian player .
whatever the provocation that led to Zidane ’ s behavior ( probably a racial comment ) , his violent act , seen around the world , has tarnished his image . the sad paradox is that while the world had been learning of and celebrating his legendary kindness as a person , he will now be distinguished for all time by an act of aggression .
indeed , Zidane ’ s status as an emblematic champion of the world ’ s most universal and popular sport does not fully explain why people have been so obsessed with him . his human qualities , as much as his talent and technical feats on the field , counted equally in establishing his popular acclaim .
for Argentineans , the diminutive Diego Maradona represented the revenge of the weak and the deprived . as a result , his countrymen excused his frequent bad behavior time and again .
moreover , after his career is over , he is unlikely to become a manager of his sport like Jean-Claude Killy , the former Alpine skier who was co-president of the 1992 winter Olympics , or his fellow football legend Michel Platini , who helped coordinate the 1998 World Cup . after all , Zidane , arguably the world ’ s best football player , left with a gesture that has no place in any game .
here is a man who is known in the most hidden corners of the planet , yet he retained the presence and discretion of a silent next-door neighbor . at a moment when integration is being debated in France , Zidane embodied the ideal of success through talent and hard work – while never betraying himself or his Algerian origins .
moreover , Zidane incarnated values that seem threatened nowadays , but to which ordinary people remain attached : loyalty to family , diligence , and cooperation . here is a man who was not only a world champion , but also a model son and father .
on the contrary , he is active in causes such as helping sick children . it is obvious that he could one day become a tremendous ambassador of peace , or for children , working with the United Nations or another international organization .
his tragedy is ultimately a personal one . nevertheless , it would be a great loss – extending far beyond the world of football – if Zidane ’ s disgraceful exit as a player comes to define his legacy as a man .
the Transatlantic Muslim Divide
compared with the tension that exists in Muslim communities across Europe , America ’ s Muslims are a more contented lot .
both income and college graduation levels match the national norms . 63 % of American Muslims report no conflict between religious devotion and living in modern society .
moreover , 85 % said suicide bombing is rarely or never justified , and only 1 % said violence to defend Islam was “ often ” permissible . in Europe , significantly higher percentages of Muslims believe that suicide bombings are “ often ” or “ sometimes ” justified .
“ What emerges , ” according to Amaney Jamal , an adviser to Pew , “ is the great success of the Muslim American population in its socioeconomic assimilation . ” Yet “ assimilation ” is not what succeeds .
this might reflect a self-selection process : only the most educated Muslims immigrate to America , as poor social services allow only the best-prepared to survive . yet even middle-class Muslims in Britain become alienated , and , unlike the Muslim poor in Europe , poor Muslims in America don ’ t express alienation or sympathy with al-Qaeda .
it can be argued that only those poor eager for the harsh but open possibilities of American life immigrate to the US . yet this doesn ’ t explain why these poorer immigrants remain religious ; wanting to succeed US-style , they should want to be quick to “ assimilate . ”
why do US Muslims do well while remaining devout and distinctive-looking ? why can they participate without assimilating ?
two factors seem significant : first , relatively porous economic , political and educational arenas that allow immigrants entry to these key areas of American life . despite the discrimination and poverty that immigrants often suffer initially , barriers to economic and political participation are relatively low .
the second factor is America ’ s pluralistic public sphere , an arena not without religion but with many religions , which are visible and active in civil life as the basis for institutions , publications , and symbols that influence values and conduct . the US is not a secular society ; it is a religiously pluralistic one with secular legal and political structures .
the prohibition against a state religion together with freedom of conscience preserves the plurality of religion in civil life . this design was crafted not only from enlightened principle but from necessity : America needed to persuade people to cross the ocean and endure the hardships of the frontier and , later , industrialization .
the benefit of that accidental generosity was the American deal : immigrants have to participate in the economic and political fracas of the nation , but without much of a social service safety “ net . ” On the other hand , they can get in .
and they can keep not only their private faith but practice it publicly . tolerance for other people ’ s religion is the price paid for tolerance of one ’ s own .
because immigrants participate in America ’ s economic and political arenas , Americans are used to different sorts of people and so distinguish those differences that might damage the country from those that will not . Americans , indeed , are familiar with difference , or at least they tend not to panic .
this means less participation and thus less familiarity with difference on the host country ’ s side . on the immigrants ’ side , there is more resentment against the host , more lassitude about the economy and politics , possible violence or an insistence on maintaining symbolic differences — ironically , in a society less able to accept them precisely because of its discomfort with difference .
this is Europe ’ s headscarf debate in a nutshell . it speaks to none of the barriers to participation or to immigrant responses to them , but demands symbolic assimilation .
to get out of it , greater entry into the economy and politics is needed , but also less demand for quick-fix assimilation . all the religions that descend from Abraham have internal mechanisms for change that allow them to reckon with new circumstances in ways that the confessional community can respect .
but Europe demands assimilation before participation in an economy that immigrants can ’ t get into anyway . this , sadly , is a road to the ghetto .
the New Obama
new YORK – After the second debate between US President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger , Mitt Romney , Obama ’ s supporters chorused in near-unison , “ He ’ s back ! ” The languid , disengaged , and lackluster performer of the first debate had disappeared , and the impressive , beloved figure of the victorious 2008 campaign had reappeared .
the old Obama was youthful , charming , graceful , and full of hope . his demeanor was crisp yet easy-going .
the Obama on display in the second debate – and the third – was harder , chillier , sadder , and more somber . there was tension in the lines of his mouth .
he spoke with a cold , disciplined energy . in repose ( as witnessed on the split screen in the reaction shots ) he was often perfectly immobile , almost stony , as if posing for a portrait .
one word for all of this would be “ presidential , ” in the sense of competent , seasoned , and sobered by reality . but that word also connotes the fearsome qualities of ruthlessness and brutality that any honest portrayal of the office of President of the United States must include in our day .
twice this autumn , Obama had already performed before tens of millions of people – in his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention and in the first debate . each time , his performance was flat .
the truth appears to be that his muse deserted him sometime in the first year of his presidency . the result was a simulacrum of the old Obama , as if he were acting the part of himself .
as so many commentators noted , in some sense he simply failed to show up . perhaps he also thought that , well ahead in the polls , he did not have to bother to engage the pesky fellow who imagined replacing him in the White House .
at the second debate , the loss of the old Obama was apparently accepted and a new one – existing , real , available , and now working in the Oval Office – made its first appearance .
has it brutalized him ? there are reasons for thinking that it has .
first , Obama has taken , perhaps , a heavier beating from his political opposition than most presidents . the theme of Obama ’ s life , clearly expressed in his eloquent memoir Dreams from My Father , and shown in the recent Frontline documentary The Choice , is reconciliation .
that was the theme of his defining speech at the Democratic convention in 2004 , with its famous line , “ There is not a liberal America and a conservative America ; there is the United States of America . ”
so , when an ideologically implacable Republican opposition , in his very first days in office , threw the vision back in his face , adopting a policy of scorched-earth opposition , the rejection was about more than policy – it affected his very being . the dreams from his father were at an end , and he was left , as he only slowly realized , with the themeless pragmatism that has become the hallmark of his administration .
unable to find common ground with the Republican opposition , he cut deals with the other powers that immediately surround the presidency : the military and security apparatus , big pharmaceutical companies , big banks , and big media .
all this , too , stood behind the performance of the man on stage during the second two debates . and if he is elected , it is this man who will govern .
the Transition to Sustainability
the scarcity of primary commodities and damage from climate change in recent years contributed to the destabilization of the world economy that gave rise to the current crisis . soaring food and fuel prices and major natural disasters played an important role in undermining financial markets , household purchasing power , and even political stability .
these investments are needed in the short term to offset the decline in worldwide consumption spending that underlies the global recession . more importantly , they are needed in the long term , because a world crowded with 6.8 billion people ( and rising ) simply cannot sustain economic growth unless it adopts sustainable technologies that economize on scarce natural resources .
in practice , the global crisis means that sustainable investments are being curtailed rather than expanded in the developing world . as access to international bank loans , bond flotations , and foreign direct investment is lost , infrastructure projects talked about in the past are now being shelved , threatening the political and economic stability of dozens of developing countries .
most infrastructure investment requires public-sector leadership to forge partnerships with the private sector . typically , the public sector must enter into contractual agreements with private firms not only to build the infrastructure , but also to operate it as a regulated monopoly or on a concession basis .
governments generally lack the needed technical capacity to design such projects , opening up possibilities of favoritism and corruption when major contracts are awarded . such charges are likely to be hurled at governments even when they are not true , though all too often they are .
the atmosphere is filling with greenhouse gases from heavy use of fossil fuels . water scarcity is hitting virtually every major economic center , from North America to Europe , Africa , India , and China .
the ability to offset the crisis in a constructive manner through expanded public-private partnerships will determine the subsequent success of countries and regions . interestingly , the US is about to create a National Infrastructure Bank for the first time .
nevertheless , American and European economic advisers generally believe that a short sharp stimulus will be enough to restore economic growth . this is wrong .
developed countries will have to do far more to help poor countries through the transition to sustainability . whereas most of the “ stimulus ” legislation to date has been short-term and inward-looking , increased funding for sustainable infrastructure in poor countries would provide a powerful boost to rich-world economies .
developed countries should agree to channel considerable savings to developing countries to finance the scale-up of sustainable investments . this can be done directly on a bilateral basis , for example , through long-term loans from developed countries ’ export-credit agencies .
the rich world somehow expects poor countries to restrict their use of fossil fuels without any significant help in financing new and sustainable sources of energy . in almost all of the rich-country proposals about targets , limits , commitments , and permits for greenhouse gases , there is hardly a word about helping poor countries to finance the transition to sustainable technologies .
the G-20 meeting in London on April 2 offers hope for a true global effort to repair the failing world economy . this is the time and place to launch the global drive toward sustainability .
the Triumphant Return of John Maynard Keynes
new YORK – We are all Keynesians now . even the right in the United States has joined the Keynesian camp with unbridled enthusiasm and on a scale that at one time would have been truly unimaginable .
for those of us who claimed some connection to the Keynesian tradition , this is a moment of triumph , after having been left in the wilderness , almost shunned , for more than three decades . at one level , what is happening now is a triumph of reason and evidence over ideology and interests .
the misguided policies that resulted – pushed by , among others , some members of US President-elect Barack Obama ’ s economic team – had earlier inflicted enormous costs on developing countries . the moment of enlightenment came only when those policies also began inflicting costs on the US and other advanced industrial countries .
but not all fiscal policies are equivalent . in America today , with an overhang of household debt and high uncertainty , tax cuts are likely to be ineffective ( as they were in Japan in the 1990 ’ s ) . much , if not most , of last February ’ s US tax cut went into savings .
with the huge debt left behind by the Bush administration , the US should be especially motivated to get the largest possible stimulation from each dollar spent . the legacy of underinvestment in technology and infrastructure , especially of the green kind , and the growing divide between the rich and the poor , requires congruence between short-run spending and a long-term vision .
lowering taxes on the poor and raising unemployment benefits while simultaneously increasing taxes on the rich can stimulate the economy , reduce the deficit , and reduce inequality . cutting expenditures on the Iraq war and increasing expenditures on education can simultaneously increase output in the short and long run and reduce the deficit .
and yet one should read history and theory carefully : preserving financial institutions is not an end in itself , but a means to an end . it is the flow of credit that is important , and the reason that the failure of banks during the Great Depression was important is that they were involved in determining creditworthiness ; they were the repositories of information necessary for the maintenance of the flow of credit .
meanwhile , too little is being done to help banks that actually do what banks are supposed to do – lend money and assess creditworthiness .
the Federal government has assumed trillions of dollars of liabilities and risks . in rescuing the financial system , no less than in fiscal policy , we need to worry about the “ bang for the buck . ” Otherwise , the deficit – which has doubled in eight years – will soar even more .
as the bailout has ballooned , it is increasingly clear that this was merely another example of financial markets mis appraising risk – just as they have done consistently in recent years . the terms of the Bernanke-Paulson bailouts were disadvantageous to taxpayers , and yet remarkably , despite their size , have done little to rekindle lending .
financial markets did well through capital market liberalization . enabling America to sell its risky financial products and engage in speculation all over the world may have served its firms well , even if they imposed large costs on others .
has there been a change of heart , or only a change in strategy ? after all , in today ’ s context , the pursuit of Keynesian policies looks even more profitable than the pursuit of market fundamentalism !
little was done . it is imperative that we not just respond adequately to the current crisis , but that we undertake the long-run reforms that will be necessary if we are to create a more stable , more prosperous , and equitable global economy .
the Triumph of Politics in Europe
Madrid – Economics , particularly economic theories , always yield in the end to political imperatives . that is why Europe ’ s fast-changing political landscape , reshaped by electoral insurrections in France and Greece against German-backed fiscal austerity , is bound to affect Europe ’ s economic policies as well .
an economically robust Germany is , without doubt , vital to the European project , if only because history has shown how dangerous an unhappy Germany can be . indeed , it was thanks to the euro – and the captive European market that goes with it – that Germany today is the world ’ s second-leading exporter ( China surpassed it in 2009 ) .
once the crisis became a sad daily reality for millions of unemployed – particularly for what appears to be a lost generation of young , jobless Europeans – EU institutions also became a target of popular rage . their inadequacies – embodied in a cumbersome system of governance , and in endless , inconclusive summitry – and their lack of democratic legitimacy are being repudiated by millions of voters throughout the continent .
Europe ’ s experience has shown that the subordination of society to economic theories is politically untenable . social vulnerability and frustration at the political system ’ s failure to provide solutions are the grounds upon which radical movements have always emerged to offer facile solutions .
a concomitant of such Kurzschluss between mainstream leaders and voters has always been the politics of accentuated ethnic identity , ultra-nationalism , and outright bigotry . former French President Nicolas Sarkozy ended up trying desperately to appeal to those very sentiments in his last-ditch effort to avert his political demise .
Tsipras might be “ impetuous , ” as his mainstream adversaries from the center-left Pasok and the center-right New Democracy would say , but he is not irrational . his is a rather sober reading of reality : the austerity plan has become a highway to social hell for his countrymen , and would likely condemn Greece to long years of ruinous depression within a permanent debt trap , and possibly to a breakdown of democracy .
Merkel ’ s now legendary obstinacy eventually might have to succumb to the imperatives of politics . it is one thing to ignore European Commission President José Manuel Barroso ’ s call for a more flexible economic policy , and quite another to dismiss out of hand the powerful message coming from French and Greek voters .
nor is it a minor political headache for Merkel to have to face an anti-austerity alliance of Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and the new French president , François Hollande . Spain ’ s capacity to withstand an austerity “ cure ” that only sinks it deeper into recession must also have its limits .
so now Germany ’ s finance ministry , the guardian of fiscal rectitude , is considering measures such as using the European Investment Bank to foster growth , issuing EU “ project bonds ” to finance infrastructure investment , and allowing wages in Germany to rise at a faster pace than in the rest of Europe . the imminent – indeed , inevitable – victory of politics over recalcitrant economics may well be at hand .
the Trouble with Hope
the human and intellectual qualities of the three remaining candidates are even viewed with some envy on this side of the Atlantic , where you can hear statements such as : “ Could we borrow just one of your candidates ? ” Many Europeans feel all three candidates are superb , and that , contrast to previous elections , America is suffering from an embarrassment of riches .
but Europeans ’ interest in this presidential election cannot mask the fact that what they expect from it is far from clear . Europeans may want a more “ normal ” America , closer to their own values , but they simultaneously worry that a more modest America would demand more of them in the realm of “ hard ” military power .
America as a model or America as a protector – this “ European dilemma ” is in itself new . for , in the immediate aftermath of World War II , most Europeans viewed the United States as both its defender against the Soviet Union ’ s expansionist aims and the key external actor for their deeply wounded continent ’ s moral and economic reconstruction .
the collapse of the USSR , America ’ s self-inflicted wounds – particularly in Iraq – and the spectacular rise of Asia have changed European perceptions of the US . America is no longer the protector or model that it used to be , nor is it alone in terms of influence and power .
in this sense , Europe has come to see itself , at least in part , as an alternative dream for everyone who had stopped dreaming about America . but , seen from within , the EU model often appears less convincing .
thus , many Europeans continue to be nostalgic for America as a model . for these Europeans , Barack Obama , campaigning under the banner of “ hope , ” is the ideal choice to restore , as if by magic , America ’ s soft power .
but some Europeans prefer Hillary Clinton or even John McCain , because they are apprehensive about the consequences for America ’ s European partners of a more restrained and less experienced president . they worry about not only competence , but also the old transatlantic issue of “ burden sharing . ”
could the restoration of America ’ s international reputation turn out to be bad for Europe , by eroding its new monopoly on representing Western values and calling it back to its hard power duties ? could it be that a candidate of fear – McCain or , increasingly , Clinton – really serves Europe ’ s interests better than a candidate of hope ?
with Obama in power , it would become – at least initially – more difficult for Europeans to denounce America , even if the “ New France ” of Nicolas Sarkozy has already moved away from this easy temptation . but it would also be less easy to reject a call for greater burden sharing in the world .
this “ defensive ” view of transatlantic relations is problematic . the best America for Europe and the world is a confident America – an America that sheds its culture of fear and rediscovers the roots of its culture of hope .
even if America is no longer the world ’ s only superpower , it still remains the “ indispensable nation . ” So Europeans are right to be fascinated by America ’ s presidential election .
the Trouble With Interest Rates
when a government agency imposes a rent ceiling , it prohibits landlords from charging more than a set amount . this distorts the market , leaving empty apartments that landlords would be willing to rent at higher prices and preventing renters from offering what they are truly willing to pay .
when a central bank reduces long-term interest rates via current and expected future open-market operations , it does not prevent potential lenders from offering to lend at higher interest rates ; nor does it stop borrowers from taking up such an offer . these transactions don ’ t take place for a simple reason : borrowers choose freely not to enter into them .
Taylor and others who share his view probably begin with a sense that current interest rates are too low . given their belief that the free market cannot fail ( it can only be failed ) , they naturally assume that some government action must be behind the unnaturally low rates .
if my intuition is correct , Taylor and his fellow travelers will never be convinced that they are wrong . accepting the idea that central bankers may be doing the best they can in a difficult situation would require entertaining the possibility that markets are imperfect and fallible .
five years ago , Taylor and his intellectual allies wrote an “ Open Letter to Ben Bernanke , ” warning that the quantitative easing planned by the Federal Reserve ’ s then-chairman risked “ currency debasement and inflation . ” But , although their prediction turned out to be spectacularly wrong , that has not led Taylor or any of the other signatories to rethink their theories or to consider that perhaps Bernanke knows something about monetary economics .
yes , the inertial expectations of the economy have combined with monetary policy to distort interest and inflation rates , but not in the direction that Taylor is proposing . on the contrary , compared to what is needed ( given the current state of the economy ) or to what a free-market , flexible-price economy in proper equilibrium would deliver , interest rates are too high and inflation is too low .
the Trouble with Japanese Nationalism
barely half a year into his premiership , Japan ’ s Shinzo Abe is provoking anger across Asia and mixed feelings in his country ’ s key ally , the United States . but will the Bush administration use its influence to nudge Abe away from inflammatory behavior ?
Abe ’ s predecessor , Junichiro Koizumi , was a mold-breaking leader , reviving Japan ’ s economy , reforming the postal savings system , and smashing the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party ’ s faction system . but Koizumi also legitimized a new Japanese nationalism , antagonizing China and South Korea by his annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine .
anyone who believes that the Yasukuni controversy is an obscure historical matter that Chinese and Koreans use to badger Japan for political advantage has probably never spent much time there . the problem is not the 12 Class-A war criminals interred at the shrine ; the real problem is the Yushukan military museum next door .
it follows the nationalist narrative : Japan , a victim of the European colonial powers , sought only to protect the rest of Asia from them . Japan ’ s colonial occupation of Korea , for example , is described as a “ partnership ” ; one looks in vain for any account of the victims of Japanese militarism in Nanjing or Manila .
but there is no other museum in Japan that gives an alternative view of Japan ’ s twentieth-century history . successive Japanese governments have hidden behind the Yushukan museum ’ s operation by a private religious organization to deny responsibility for the views expressed there .
in fact , unlike Germany , Japan has never come to terms with its own responsibility for the Pacific War . although socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama officially apologized to China in 1995 for the war , Japan has never had a genuine internal debate over its degree of responsibility , and has never made a determined effort to propagate an alternative account to that of Yushukan .
in the course of a couple of encounters , I heard him explain in front of large public audiences how the people of Manchuria had tears in their eyes when the occupying Kwantung Army left China , so grateful were they to Japan . according to Watanabe , the Pacific War boiled down to race , as the US was determined to keep a non-white people down .
moreover , there have been several disturbing recent incidents in which physical intimidation has been used by nationalists against critics of Koizumi ’ s Yasukuni visits , such as the firebombing of former prime ministerial candidate Kato Koichi ’ s home . ( on the other hand , the publisher of the normally conservative Yomiuri Shimbun attacked Koizumi ’ s Yasukuni visits and published a fascinating series of articles on responsibility for the war . )
a number of American strategists are eager to ring China with a NATO-like defensive barrier , building outward from the US-Japan Security Treaty . since the final days of the Cold War , the US has been pushing Japan to rearm , and has officially supported a proposed revision of Article 9 of the postwar constitution , which bans Japan from having a military or waging war .
the legitimacy of the entire American military position in the Far East is built around the US exercising Japan ’ s sovereign function of self-defense . Japan ’ s unilateral revision of Article 9 , viewed against the backdrop of its new nationalism , would isolate Japan from virtually the whole of Asia .
revising Article 9 has long been part of Abe ’ s agenda , but whether he pushes ahead with it will depend in large part on the kind of advice he gets from close friends in the US . President Bush was unwilling to say anything about Japan ’ s new nationalism to his “ good friend Junichiro ” out of gratitude for Japanese support in Iraq .
the Trouble with Libertarian Paternalism
a clear example is financial regulation , which in many ways is a form of paternalism . in the US , the low risk assigned to senior tranches of mortgage-backed securities made them attractive instruments for banks to hold , given the relatively high return they offered .
other examples of the danger of the coordinating power of government paternalism abound . as I drive to downtown Chicago , I pass a series of high-rise housing projects , meant in their time to be the miracle cure for homelessness , poverty , unemployment , and crime .
not only were the housing projects kept a safe distance from areas that had good jobs , but , with few residents experiencing stable families and livelihoods , there were not enough local examples of success to guide young people . as a result , many went astray .
the fashion today is to integrate poor households into flourishing communities . no doubt we will discover some unintended consequences in the future , and the power of government coordination will ensure that those consequences are widespread .
my colleague , Richard Thaler , along with Cass Sunstein , who currently serves in the Obama administration , wrote a best-selling book , Nudge , in which they suggest a way to reduce our uneasiness with paternalism . essentially , by exploiting behavioral quirks , they would nudge people into making decisions that are good for them , even while individuals have complete freedom to change their mind .
often , the default option is unsuitable for most individuals – for instance , it typically allocates all savings to low-return money-market funds . Sunstein and Thaler would have the employer choose a default option that works for most people , such as 60 % in equities , 30 % in bonds , and 10 % in money-market funds .
the libertarian part is that the employee has the right to opt out of the default option . because people rarely move away from the default option , the employer ’ s paternalistic choice prevails , and we get libertarian paternalism .
choice remains unexercised , because individuals do not consciously think through their decision . if their choices can be directed , is this not paternalism plain and simple , rendered more sinister because individuals are unaware that they are being nudged , and cannot raise their guard ?
one response is to point out that most plans already have a default option that determines savings allocations . Sunstein and Thaler merely say that the default option should be set in a way that is good for people , and clearly they have an idea of what is good .
this , they believe , is better than the current typical default option of putting individuals ’ money into money-market funds . but it may be worse : coordinating everyone into risky asset investments may be more dangerous than coordinating them into boring investments like money-market funds .
what if there were no default option , and individuals were sent repeated , and increasingly urgent , reminders to choose an allocation if they did not choose one already . the conventional wisdom could be offered as a recommendation , along with explanations of why it makes sense , but it would not be the default .
more generally , the flaw in some forms of libertarian paternalism is that the free choice that it appears to offer leaves the paternalism largely unconstrained . would it not be far better to force conscious choice in order to limit the consequences of paternalistic mistakes ?
the True Costs of the Iraq War
the most important things in life ­ like life itself ­ are priceless . but that doesn ’ t mean that issues involving the preservation of life ( or a way of life ) , like defense , should not be subjected to cool , hard economic analysis .
shortly before the current Iraq war , when Bush administration economist Larry Lindsey suggested that the costs might range between $ 100 and $ 200 billion , other officials quickly demurred . for example , Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels put the number at $ 60 billion .
our analysis starts with the $ 500 billion that the Congressional Budget Office openly talks about , which is still ten times higher than what the administration said the war would cost . its estimate falls so far short because the reported numbers do not even include the full budgetary costs to the government .
for example , the Bush administration has been doing everything it can to hide the huge number of returning veterans who are severely wounded – 16,000 so far , including roughly 20 % with serious brain and head injuries . so it is no surprise that its figure of $ 500 billion ignores the lifetime disability and healthcare costs that the government will have to pay for years to come .
nor does the administration want to face up to the military ’ s recruiting and retention problems . the result is large re-enlistment bonuses , improved benefits , and higher recruiting costs – up 20 % just from 2003 to 2005 .
these budgetary costs ( exclusive of interest ) amount to $ 652 billion in our conservative estimate and $ 799 billion in our moderate estimate . arguably , since the government has not reined in other expenditures or increased taxes , the expenditures have been debt financed , and the interest costs on this debt add another $ 98 billion ( conservative ) to $ 385 billion ( moderate ) to the budgetary costs .
but the military pays disability benefits that are markedly lower than the value of lost earnings . similarly , payments for those who are killed amount to only $ 500,000 , which is far less than standard estimates of the lifetime economic cost of a death , sometimes referred to as the statistical value of a life ( $ 6.1 to $ 6.5 million ) .
the Bush administration once claimed that the Iraq war would be good for the economy , with one spokesperson even suggesting that it was the best way to ensure low oil prices . as in so many other ways , things have turned out differently : the oil companies are the big winners , while the American and global economies are losers .
at the same time , money spent on the war could have been spent elsewhere . we estimate that if a proportion of that money had been allocated to domestic investment in roads , schools , and research , the American economy would have been stimulated more in the short run , and its growth would have been enhanced in the long run .
there are a number of other costs , some potentially quite large , although quantifying them is problematic . for instance , Americans pay some $ 300 billion annually for the “ option value ” of military preparedness – being able to fight wherever needed .
in short , even our “ moderate ” estimate may significantly underestimate the cost of America ’ s involvement in Iraq . and our estimate does not include any of the costs implied by the enormous loss of life and property in Iraq itself .
we do not attempt to explain whether the American people were deliberately misled regarding the war ’ s costs , or whether the Bush administration ’ s gross underestimate should be attributed to incompetence , as it vehemently argues is true in the case of weapons of mass destruction .
recent evidence that deaths and injuries would have been greatly reduced had better body armor been provided to troops suggests how short-run frugality can lead to long-run costs . certainly , when a war ’ s timing is a matter of choice , as in this case , inadequate preparation is even less justifiable .
elaborate cost-benefit analyses of major projects have been standard practice in the defense department and elsewhere in government for almost a half-century . the Iraq war was an immense “ project , ” yet it now appears that the analysis of its benefits was greatly flawed and that of its costs virtually absent .
one cannot help but wonder : were there alternative ways of spending a fraction of the war ’ s $ 1- $ 2 trillion in costs that would have better strengthened security , boosted prosperity , and promoted democracy ?
the Global Trust Deficit
new YORK – In their preoccupation with fiscal deficits , developed-country policymakers continue to neglect a different , yet equally critical , shortfall : the trust deficit between advanced and emerging economies when it comes to global governance .
for decades , developed-country shareholders at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank used loan conditionality to spur economic reforms – often including contentious fiscal-austerity measures – in the so-called Third World . through pragmatic , sustained reform efforts , countries like Brazil , China , and India turned their economies around to achieve stunning increases in GDP growth – from an average annual rate of 3.5 % in 1980-1994 to 5.5 % since then .
but , although developing countries now account for more than half of global GDP growth , advanced countries have yet to admit them to leadership roles that reflect their growing influence in the world economy .
in fact , a backlash against Western hegemony in global governance has been brewing for years , with developing countries increasingly turning away from the IMF in favor of creating alternative , regional sources of funding . the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , together with China , Japan , and South Korea , established the Chiang Mai Initiative in 2000 , and Latin American countries launched negotiations on the Banco del Sur in 2006 .
the accelerating erosion of emerging economies ’ trust in the Bretton Woods institutions is particularly problematic now , given slow growth and continued economic weakness in advanced countries . while the world economy is expected to grow by 3.3 % this year , average annual growth in the advanced countries is projected to be just 1.2 % .
developed and developing countries alike would benefit from greater economic-policy coordination . while regional groups may obtain some short-run benefits by pursuing narrower interests outside of multilateral channels , neither emerging nor advanced economies can fulfill their long-run potential in an environment characterized by isolationism and a zero-sum mentality in areas like trade and exchange-rate policy .
policy coordination , however , depends on trust , and building trust requires advanced-country leaders to keep their promises and offer their developing-country counterparts opportunities for leadership . instead , developed countries have been taking actions that compromise their legitimacy .
for example , after spending decades encouraging developing countries to integrate their economies into the global market , advanced countries now balk at trade openness . indeed , despite pledges not to erect trade barriers after the global economic crisis , more than 800 new protectionist measures were introduced from late 2008 through 2010 .
but many emerging markets are already leading by example on important issues like the need to shift global financial flows from debt toward equity . Mexico , for example , recently adopted – ahead of schedule – the changes in capital requirements for banks recommended by the Third Basel Accord ( Basel III ) , in order to reduce leverage and increase stability .
for too long , developed countries have clung to their outsize influence in the international financial institutions , even as their fiscal fitness has dwindled . by ignoring the advice that they so vehemently dispensed to the developing world , they brought the world economy to its knees .
leaders in developed and developing countries alike must deepen their commitment to economic reform and integration . but only by giving emerging economies a real voice in global governance – thereby reducing the trust deficit and restoring legitimacy to multilateral institutions – can the global economy reach its potential .
the Truth About Climate Change
the most definitive examination of the scientific evidence is to be found in the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and its last major report published in 2007 . I had the privilege of being chairman or co-chairman of the Panel ’ s scientific assessments from 1988 to 2002 .
first , they tried to deny the existence of any scientific evidence for global warming . more recently , they have largely accepted the fact of anthropogenic ( man-made ) climate change but argue that its impacts will not be great , that we can “ wait and see , ” and that in any case we can always fix the problem if it turns out to be substantial .
the scientific evidence does not support such arguments . urgent action is needed both to adapt to the climate change that is inevitable and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , especially CO2 , to prevent further damage as far as possible .
it is now recognized that widespread damage due , for instance , to sea level rise and more frequent and intense heat waves , floods and droughts , will occur even for small increases of global average temperature . therefore it is necessary that very strong efforts be made to hold the average global temperature rise below 2º Celsius relative to its preindustrial level .
one clear requirement is that tropical deforestation , which is responsible for 20 % of greenhouse gas emissions , be halted within the next decade or two . regarding emissions from the burning of fossil fuels , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) in its “ Energy Technology Perspectives ” has set out in detail the technologies and actions that are needed in different countries and sectors to meet these targets .
for the short term , the IEA points out that very strong and determined action will be necessary to ensure that global CO2 emissions stop rising ( the current increase is more than 3 % per year ) , reach a peak by about 2015 , and then decline steadily toward the 2050 target . the IEA also points out that the targets can be achieved without unacceptable economic damage .
what is required now is recognition that anthropogenic climate change will severely affect our children , grandchildren , the world ’ s ecosystems , and the world ’ s poorer communities , and that the severity of the impact can be substantially alleviated by taking action now .
the Truth about NATO Burden-Sharing
Brussels – When discussing Afghanistan , many newspapers continue to suggest that some of Europe ’ s NATO allies are under-performing in Afghanistan , and are either unable or unwilling to make a greater effort . naturally , these allies feel that their efforts are under-valued .
first of all , the debate about burden-sharing should not be reduced solely to today ’ s force levels in Afghanistan , because , however important these force levels are , they tell only part of the story . so let me broaden the debate and offer a more holistic perspective by covering three interconnected elements : defense transformation , operations , and the wider context of the international community ’ s efforts .
it is a golden rule within the alliance that the bulk of NATO ’ s forces and capabilities are owned by individual nations – the alliance ’ s fleet of Airborne Warning and Command System ( AWACS ) aircraft is a rare exception . as I don ’ t expect nations to abandon this principle , NATO will continue to depend on individual allies and their willingness to commit resources .
large proportions of NATO allies ’ armed forces are still better suited for static territorial defense than for the expeditionary type of operation needed in Afghanistan . and , when the right type of forces and capabilities do exist , operations led by the United Nations , the European Union , or ad hoc coalitions , as well as national requirements , place additional demands on these assets .
but it is not possible to convert territorial forces into expeditionary forces overnight , and the costs of transformation often must compete with the costs of deploying forces for operations . many allies face the dilemma of either spending money on operations or investing in new acquisition programs .
moreover , many allies ’ failure to respect the 2 % -of-GDP target for their defense budgets exacerbates this dilemma , and also widens the capability gap with those allies that are investing in usable and deployable forces . but , while there is no substitute for appropriate defense budgets , we could get more from current spending levels , especially through a smarter approach to defense acquisition .
unfortunately , despite the efforts of NATO and the EU , Europe ’ s defense sector remains fragmented , which leads to duplication , unhelpful competition from too many rival systems , and , significant capability gaps or incompatibilities . in Afghanistan , for example , national systems for friendly-force tracking , which are vital to preventing accidental attacks on one ’ s own forces or allies , are not compatible .
in Europe , many national defense budgets can no longer sustain both fully-fledged national forces and a national defense industry . only smarter multinational and transatlantic cooperation will give us forces that are capable of dealing with today ’ s security challenges .
in an alliance founded on the principle of “ all for one , and one for all , ” it is vital that all nations are seen to contribute fairly to operations . thus , NATO , developed a burden-sharing mechanism to assess members ’ manning commitments for critical operational activities relative to their gross national income .
this sort of arithmetic has the merit of giving some indications about burden-sharing , but it has also been shown that burden-sharing cannot be fully captured in graphs and spreadsheets . how does one decide what is a fair contribution from a country of 50 million people compared to a country with only four million ?
common funding , with all members paying a share according to their GDP , is one instrument that can be used to achieve more equitable burden-sharing . traditionally , NATO applied a policy of “ costs lie where they fall ” : each member picked up all the costs for the operational contribution that it made to an Alliance operation .
burden-sharing is a sensitive issue , for both NATO and the international community , and passions sometimes run high . by stepping back and looking at the broader picture , it is clear that it is not just a matter of having the right capabilities , but also of having the money and political will to deploy them .
no single measure can resolve the burden-sharing problem . but the range of initiatives now underway within NATO should help : transformation efforts to increase the pool of usable and deployable forces ; wider use of multinational initiatives ; greater reliance on common funding to assist force generation ; and a comprehensive approach for sharing burdens more equitably across the entire international community .
the sense of keeping one ’ s obligations and commitments to other allies , upon whom one ’ s own security ultimately depends , is a powerful motive for equitable burden-sharing . totally fair burden-sharing may not be possible , but a security organization like NATO undoubtedly allows us to come closer to it than any other approach .
the Truth about Negotiations
while so-called “ win-win ” outcomes are increasingly considered to be the ultimate purpose of every negotiation , what if the negotiating parties contemplate a win-win outcome that actually harms non-participants to the talks , or is against the law ? what if the outcome is beneficial but contrary to the principles of the negotiating parties ?
a strategy that could work would be to stress how the outcome is beneficial to everyone involved . but the outcome you propose might not be fair , or realistic , or you might be consciously lying .
indeed , when one ponders how many issues there are to consider , it becomes obvious that negotiation is a type of communication that involves far more than interests . principles , morality , and simple respect for the truth guide agreement as much as interests do .
if this were correct , the United States was right to wage war on Iraq on the basis of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein ’ s regime . but it is now widely accepted that the way in which the US negotiated its way into war was a mistake – one that has cost it enormous credibility as a negotiating partner .
in fact , the US often stands for high principles , such as freedom and democracy , and incorporates them successfully into its foreign policy . defending economic aid to Europe after World War II , General George C. Marshall , then US Secretary of State , gave an inspirational speech that argued that US policy is not directed against “ any country or doctrine , but against hunger , poverty , desperation , and chaos . ”
even if the Cameron government ’ s rhetoric seems to be focused on “ interests , ” its negotiating positions also reflect higher principles , just as other countries ’ do . the United Nations and other organizations bear witness to countries ’ commitment to principles of justice and solidarity , and to their willingness to set aside their narrow agendas to serve higher causes .
but the contemporary philosopher Jürgen Habermas argues that moral norms are valid as long as people accept them freely after having considered the consequences of their implementation for the satisfaction of interests . of course , consideration of interests means just that : they must be taken into account ; they do not have to be entirely satisfied .
in some cases , the defense of interests alone might seem appropriate – &amp; # 160 ; for example , in certain business transactions . the more complicated a negotiation , though , the more difficult it is to disregard complex issues such as values and norms or the importance of being sincere .
if negotiations truly need proper argumentation of this sort , it surely makes sense that many differences are resolved outside the context of negotiations . likewise , certain “ negotiations ” are not negotiations at all , but are better understood as processes of extortion and blackmail .
resolving disputes requires mutually accepted principles that guide how individuals and countries interact . negotiation is the path toward successful conflict resolution , but it should be conducted according to basic rules of true and open communication .
countries and peoples should stop debating the interests that often divide them and start discussing the principles that unite them . as long as communication is conducted truthfully and with respect to values , norms , and objective facts , negotiations will be able to achieve consensus and agreement . &amp; # 160 ;
the Tsunami Effect
the extraordinary international response to the tsunamis that devastated South Asia is a remarkable political phenomenon . though it is too soon to predict all the effects , some good consequences are already evident , as are some that are troublesome and others whose impact will play out over time .
one useful consequence is that wealthy countries ’ low levels of assistance to those less fortunate has gained wider attention . plainly , the comment by Jan Egeland , the United Nations official in charge of humanitarian assistance , calling the West “ stingy , ” hit home , especially in the United States .
while condemning Egeland ’ s comment , Bush quickly multiplied America ’ s commitment ten-fold . in addition , he enlisted former Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton to lead a private fundraising effort .
this neatly fit a standard response to criticism of the level of American assistance : that private philanthropy exceeds government aid . depending on what monies are included , this is true , although the British , Dutch , Germans , French , and other Europeans are also generous donors , despite lacking the tax benefits that encourage private philanthropy in the US .
moreover , like official US assistance , a relatively small share of American private philanthropy ordinarily goes to the poorest countries . in contrast , the countries that are most generous – Norway , Sweden , Denmark , the Netherlands , and tiny Luxemburg – give proportionately far more than American governmental and private assistance combined , and the lion ’ s share of their aid goes to the world ’ s most impoverished countries .
in the wake of the tsunamis , it seems possible that the US and other wealthy countries will rethink their assistance programs and , possibly , step up their aid to those most in need . perhaps even some oil-rich governments will be embarrassed by attention to their miserliness in doling out assistance .
similarly , the number of those forcibly displaced is a multiple of those who lost their homes and livelihoods due to the tsunamis . yet MSF was able to collect only € 650,000 in two months of soliciting funds for Darfur , while it received € 40 million for the tsunami victims in just eight days .
another question likely to loom large in coming months is whether assistance is politicized and free of corruption . politicization is important because the two countries that were hardest hit , Indonesia and Sri Lanka , both suffer armed conflicts in tsunami-hit regions .
Germany , where combined public and private aid for tsunami victims has reached $ 1.1 billion ( making it the largest international donor ) , says that it would like its aid to be used to foster peace settlements . a worthy goal , but successful models do not come readily to mind .
during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia the UN was responsible for humanitarian assistance and also dedicated to peacemaking . yet it was never able to use the former to advance the latter .
Nicaragua ’ s dictator , Anastasio Somoza , diverted much of the international assistance meant for the survivors into his own pockets and those of his cronies . in the process , he incited popular support for the left-wing Sandinista guerrillas who toppled his government later in the decade .
doing so requires putting the right person in charge — someone like Paul Hoffman , the American industrialist who managed the Marshall Plan more than half a century ago and , subsequently , headed the UN Development Program . it also requires making sure that the person in charge gets the staff assistance and the political backing required to do the job well .
Taksim and the Left
Istanbul – The small park in Taksim Square in the sprawling metropolis of Istanbul is one of the few green spaces left in the city center . on May 28 , a handful of Turkish environmentalists started a peaceful protest against a redevelopment plan for the park that would replace the greenery with a replica of an Ottoman-era army barracks , a shopping mall , and apartments .
the redevelopment plan for the park triggered a huge protest against what a large segment of the Turkish public , particularly young people , considers paternalistic and authoritarian political leadership . the movement ’ s rapid growth was fueled by widespread opposition to what many regard as official efforts to regiment lifestyles , as well as by frustration over perceived economic inequities .
indeed , though environmentalists and secular youth spearheaded the protest movement , it became remarkably diverse and inclusive almost overnight . pious Muslims – particularly those who believe that Turkey ’ s urban development has created too much rent-seeking and too many easy fortunes – joined the demonstrations as well , as did some far-left groups .
moreover , important figures in or close to the ruling Justice and Development Party expressed their willingness to hold a dialogue with the protesters . President Abdullah Gül , in particular , played a calming , statesmanlike role .
a striking feature of the protests has been the distance that the demonstrators have put between themselves and existing political parties , including the Republican People ’ s Party ( CHP ) , the largest force in the center-left secular opposition . in this sense , the Taksim “ sit-in ” resembles protests elsewhere , particularly in the advanced democracies , from the “ Occupy Wall Street ” movement to the protests in Spain and Italy .
to be sure , there are country-specific features to such protests – including , in Turkey ’ s case , the reaction against lifestyle paternalism . but social democrats must understand why the protests developed quite independently of existing , organized , center-left politics .
modern production systems , in which information technology plays an increasingly crucial role , are totally different from the large factory floors that characterized the birth of trade unionism and social democracy . the way much of GDP is now produced has made it significantly harder for the left to organize in traditional ways .
yet information technology and global social media have empowered people to overcome social fragmentation along occupational , residential , and national lines . on some recent days , posts about Taksim Square have reportedly occupied a huge part of the entire world ’ s “ Tweet space . ”
nonetheless , what dominates is a desire for individual freedom , an acceptance of diversity , great concern for the environment , and a refusal to be “ organized ” from above . Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu , the CHP ’ s reformist leader , quickly recognized these dynamics : “ The demonstrators don ’ t want us on the front lines , ” he said , “ and we have much to learn from these events . ”
whether in New York , Paris , Madrid , Rome , Istanbul , or New Delhi , a feeling of unease and a desire for change has emerged in societies that are becoming increasingly unequal , and in which politics and business mix in non-transparent ways . rising youth unemployment and cuts in pensions and social expenditures come at a time when many large multinational corporations legally avoid taxes by shifting their profits to favorable jurisdictions .
the democratic opposition can address the flaws of the existing order only if it recognizes the need for very different forms of mobilization from those of the past . it must recognize a strong popular desire for individual autonomy , more leadership positions for women and the young , and greater support for individual enterprise ( along with reforms of social insurance that make it cost-effective and truly inclusive ) .
acting on their own , nation-states can successfully address neither tax avoidance nor carbon emissions . the renewed patriotism seen in many places &amp; # 160 ; – a response to the unfairness and dislocation that globalization can generate – must be reconciled with human solidarity , respect for diversity , and the ability to work across national borders .
the events that started in Taksim Square are specific to Turkey , but they mirror aspirations that are universal . the same can be said for the challenge facing the democratic left .
the Twilight of Pervez Musharraf
of the three , it is the army leadership that has the clearest means of ridding the country of Pakistan ’ s president in uniform , Pervez Musharraf . and that ’ s the main reason any power-sharing deal with former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is unlikely to end Pakistan ’ s political turmoil .
Musharraf hoped to extend his presidency this fall without caving in to opposition demands that he renounce his military position and restore a civilian rival to the post of prime minister . but few international leaders face such a wide range of sworn domestic enemies .
since seizing power following a 1999 coup , Musharraf has survived at least three serious assassination attempts . his anti-terrorist partnership with the United States fatally undermined his political alliance with Pakistan ’ s religious conservatives even before his government stormed Islamabad ’ s Red Mosque in July , killing more than 100 people .
their anger , inflamed in March when he tried unsuccessfully to sack the Supreme Court ’ s independent-minded chief justice , rages on . the court recently ruled that Nawaz Sharif , who Musharraf unseated eight years ago , must be allowed to return from exile .
his “ decisive struggle against dictatorship ” – and determined opposition to any deal with Bhutto that excludes him – will intensify . Musharraf is warning him to remain in London .
some in Washington charge that he has done too little to roust al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters from safe havens along the country ’ s border with Afghanistan . his recent flirtation with a plan to bypass Bhutto and declare emergency rule provoked pointed Bush administration criticism .
but it ’ s the army that is most likely to eventually decide the fate of his presidency . Musharraf ’ s rule has given the military leadership a strong role in policymaking , but his eight years in office have badly damaged domestic support for the army ’ s influence within the government .
aware of a potential threat from within their ranks , Musharraf has populated his inner circle with relatively junior ( and reliably loyal ) officers . but a deal that makes Bhutto prime minister would undermine the military ’ s influence – and eventually its support for Musharraf ’ s presidency .
the army is unlikely to move on Musharraf directly unless subtler methods fail . the generals know that another coup would further weaken the military ’ s popular standing – as well as Pakistan ’ s relations with the US – at a moment when Bhutto and Sharif have raised expectations at home and abroad for a permanent return to civilian rule .
but if Musharraf were to refuse to go quietly , the generals could promise him a long list of public corruption charges that he must survive without their protection . Musharraf ’ s presidency won ’ t survive long without military backing .
to preserve the appearance that their meddling is benign , senior military officers probably know that they cannot afford to install another general as president . instead , they will most likely support cosmetic political reforms , including a new law that formally separates the roles of army commander and head of state .
that is the strategy the military adopted in 1988 , following the mysterious plane crash that killed former President ( and General ) Mohammed Zia ul-Haq . the army leadership ordered elections , permitted the formation of a civilian government , and then stage-managed the political process from the wings .
Bhutto , the leader of a secular party that now enjoys substantial support in Washington , would dominate policy planning in the next government at Musharraf ’ s expense . she must build on her domestic support , but she can rely on economic and security cooperation with America to safeguard the country ’ s stability .
in addition , the military ’ s role as guarantor of stability , and its tight control of Pakistan ’ s nuclear arsenal , the army ’ s crown jewels , will continue . the Bush administration can therefore enthusiastically back a return to civilian rule and claim a much-needed victory for democracy in a Muslim country .
Sharif would fulminate against her every misstep , threats of attack from religious radicals would continue , and the military would safeguard its interests from just off stage . adding to the pressure , America would expect the kind of cooperation in pacifying Pakistan ’ s tribal areas that Musharraf has proven unable to provide .
the military will , under any scenario , continue to quell fears of complete political chaos . but it would also likely ensure that a Musharraf-Bhutto deal does not fully close a tumultuous chapter in Pakistan ’ s history .
the Two Faces of Vladimir Putin
one minute , President Vladimir Putin ’ s regime is on a charm offensive , desiring a settlement to its six-decade-old territorial dispute with Japan over the Kurile Islands and reassuring investors following the conviction of oil billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky . the next moment Putin balks at removing Russia ’ s military garrison from Moldova ’ s secessionist Transdniester region while prosecutors talk ominously of putting more oligarchs in the dock .
this bizarre brew appears to have been concocted in an effort to reconcile the irreconcilable : the current yearning for democracy with Russia ’ s despotic past . but , like any muddle , it is succeeding only in confusing Russians about themselves and their country .
at other times , like Stalin , he believes that Russia ’ s power requires a strong hand – what he calls his “ dictatorship of law . ” The problem , as Khodorkovsky ’ s conviction demonstrated , is that dictatorship usually seems to be trumping law .
historically , attempts at modernization in Russia , even when they look real , as with Stalin ’ s industrialization or Yeltsin ’ s market reforms , ultimately result in a Potemkin village-like state of affairs , because Russian society cannot change fast enough or with the patience necessary to see the changes through .
so , when Yeltsin ’ s American-style democratization of the 1990 ’ s failed to bring “ orderly ” capitalism instantly , Putin on his accession imposed a restoration of state “ order , ” as if a stable political or economic system demanded a fusing of the Soviet past with the Orthodox Church and Mother Russia imagery .
indeed , Putin ’ s signature characteristic is to be all men for all Russia ’ s people . by blending the Soviet past with the Tsarist past and a few shards of Yeltsin-era democracy , Putin seems to think that he can neutralize the extremes of Russian history .
the nineteenth-century czar Alexander III once said : “ Russia has only two true allies – its army and its navy . ” Oil is Putin ’ s army and navy , allowing him to build and maintain the image of a strong , but also an internationalist , state .
Alexander &apos;s formula is also popular today with Putin ’ s nationalists in Moscow and St. Petersburg . in his pro-imperial Russia film “ The Barber of Siberia , ” the Oscar-winning director Nikita Mikhalkov – whose father composed the Stalin-era national anthem that Putin recently revived – used the coronation of Alexander III as the symbolic centerpiece of Russia ’ s greatness , inviting Russian leaders to walk in his footsteps .
this strong-willed monarch , while ruling the Russian empire autocratically , managed to bring stability and prosperity , allowing capitalism to take root . he worked to strengthen and modernize Russia ’ s armed forces while avoiding armed conflict .
Putin sees his own crusade to save Russia from disintegration and separatism as similar to Alexander ’ s . but how forward-looking is it to model a twenty-first-century country on the absolutist example of the past ?
here , too , Putin tries to walk on both sides of the street , calling Koba a tyrant to sooth the wounded feelings the Baltic leaders , yet instantly qualifying his remarks by saying that Stalin was no Hitler . can we really compare the degree of evil of these two men ?
despite his insistence on rubbing shoulders with world leaders and portraying himself as a modernizer , Putin , like his predecessors , is in fact a ruler who believes that only authoritarian rule can protect his country from anarchy and disintegration . but the old ideas , the mimicry and symbols Putin employs to achieve his goals , no longer correspond to today ’ s realities or Russia ’ s present capabilities .
now Russianness itself seems to lack a secure foundation , for it is but a hollow shell of discarded state symbols . like a bad driver , a nation that looks left and right but never ahead is bound to crash .
the Tyranny of King Cotton
the United States pays only lip service to free market principles , favoring Washington lobbyists and campaign contributors who demand just the opposite . indeed , it is America ’ s own agricultural subsidies that helped kill , at least for now , the so-called Doha Development Round of trade negotiations that were supposed to give poor countries new opportunities to enhance their growth .
subsidies hurt developing country farmers because they lead to higher output – and lower global prices . the Bush administration – supposedly committed to free markets around the world – has actually almost doubled the level of agricultural subsidies in the US .
without subsidies , it would not pay for Americans to produce much cotton ; with them , the US is the world ’ s largest cotton exporter . some 25,000 rich American cotton farmers divide $ 3 to $ 4 billion in subsidies among themselves – with most of the money going to a small fraction of the recipients .
seldom have so few done so much damage to so many . that damage is all the greater when we consider how America ’ s trade subsidies contributed to the demise of the Doha Round .
rather than offering to do away with its cotton subsidies , America offered to open up American markets to cotton imports – an essentially meaningless public-relations move that quickly backfired . owing to its huge subsidies , America exports cotton , and it would import little even if formal barriers are removed .
thus , recent trade negotiations have a surreal air about them , because , whatever their outcome , ultimately cotton subsidies will have to go . Brazil , frustrated with America ’ s intransigence , brought a case against US cotton subsidies before the WTO , which ruled as almost any economist would : the subsidies distort world trade and are therefore prohibited .
faced with the WTO order , the US will try to comply with the letter of the law and avoid its spirit , making changes in the subsidy program to ensure “ technical ” compliance . but these attempts will almost surely fail ; in the end – though it may take years – cotton subsidies will be eliminated .
of course , the European Union ’ s subsidies are far larger , but , in contrast to the US , Europe has made some effort to reduce them , especially export subsidies . while export subsidies appear more obviously “ trade distorting , ” America ’ s cotton and other subsidies are in fact almost as bad .
had the Bush administration fulfilled its commitments , Americans taxpayers would have benefited from the elimination of huge agricultural subsidies – a real boon in this era of yawning budget deficits . Americans would have been better off as consumers , too , with increased access to a variety of low-cost goods from poor countries .
likewise , migration pressure would have been reduced , because it is the huge disparity in incomes more than anything else that leads people to leave their homes and families to immigrate to the US . a fair trade regime would have helped reduce that disparity .
indeed , citizens throughout the rich developed world all stand to benefit from a more prosperous globe – especially a world in which there is less poverty , with fewer people facing despair . for we all suffer from the political instability to which such despair gives rise .
but it is America that perhaps now stands to gain the most by reviving the Doha talks with a more credible and generous offer . America ’ s influence in the world has suffered greatly in the last few years ; the Bush administration ’ s hypocritical use of free-market rhetoric while pursuing protectionist policies has made matters worse .
America ’ s national interests thus dictate a change of policy . but there is also another powerful rationale for doing so : treating fairly those who are poorer and less powerful is the morally right thing to do .
Europe ’ s National Wild Cards
Dublin – Europe ’ s needs and Europeans ’ desires are at odds . at a time when strong , coordinated action is needed to stave off financial collapse in the European Union , the popular support that drove European integration over the last six decades is waning .
after almost 70 years of peace , Europeans seem to have forgotten why unity was so important , indulging nationalist sentiment without regard for its potential consequences . at the same time , they fail to grasp that their economies are too closely interconnected for independent economic policy to work .
this failure is rooted in electoral politics ’ confinement to individual countries , which forces politicians to pretend that they can address economic issues with national policies alone . indeed , politicians face no electoral pressure to pursue broader action , even if it would bring domestic benefits .
now the euro crisis is forcing EU leaders to address institutional changes – namely the creation of banking , fiscal , and political union – that they have long deferred . but , while member states must agree unanimously on all key decisions , their mandates oblige them to view EU issues through the prism of national interest .
although the UK is not a eurozone member , its cooperation is crucial if EU institutions are to be used to solve the euro crisis . but , rather than offer the support that its European partners need , Britain is pursuing its own agenda .
for example , by refusing to sign the fiscal compact , which imposes stricter controls on national spending in the eurozone , the UK has forced the arrangement to operate outside EU mechanisms . the UK ’ s rationale for its refusal – that no protocol was included in the treaty exempting the financial sector from certain regulations – suggests that similar outcomes can be expected in future negotiations .
in fact , as Prime Minister David Cameron recently explained , his government seeks to renegotiate the terms of its EU membership , and to hold a referendum on the outcome , which potentially would decide whether the UK remains an EU member . while the UK is entirely free to leave the EU , given that it is a treaty-based union , the move carries serious risks .
in preparation for the renegotiation , UK leaders are conducting a comprehensive audit of EU laws in order to identify powers that could be reclaimed . this could have a positive outcome , highlighting powers that other member states agree should be returned to national governments .
the problem is that the UK has a strong interest in retaining full access to the EU market – the eurozone accounts for half of its exports of goods and services – but seems unwilling to submit to any obligation . as a result , British officials appear more likely to develop proposals that suit only the UK , and that could give it an unfair advantage .
like all markets , the EU ’ s Single Market is a political construct that relies on common rules , regulations , and conventions for stability and reliability . returning to national governments rule-making powers that could be used to impose criteria aimed at excluding others would endanger the entire market .
likewise , some regulation – for example , environmental rules , product-safety standards , and anti-trust enforcement – is needed to ensure that competition is fair . before the referendum is held , the UK public must understand that such matters simply cannot be returned to national authorities .
if the UK presents a unilateral list of proposals for new EU rules , the other 26 EU member states could be encouraged to engage in brinkmanship of their own . the likely result – 27 disparate sets of demands – could lead to the serial re-opening of old compromises on issues that have little relevance to the urgent threats that the EU now faces .
member states simply do not have the time to conduct a case-by-case analysis of requests from the UK – or the concomitant deliberations . and the European Court of Justice would have difficulty reconciling a special set of exceptions for one country with the shared rights and freedoms on which the EU is based .
Cameron ’ s supporters cite the precedent set by Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson , who in 1975 renegotiated the terms of Britain ’ s &amp; # 160 ; membership in the European Economic Community – terms that his conservative predecessor , Edward Heath , had accepted a few years earlier – and then held a referendum on continued EEC membership . this tactic worked once , they argue , and it will work again .
by contrast , Cameron will face 27 distinct countries ( including Croatia , which will join later this year ) , many of which are facing serious domestic challenges . as a result , the negotiations have far more serious political implications – and far more room for error .
despite these risks , many British politicians believe that they can satisfy voters at the expense of “ Europe , ” perpetuating the idea that ties with the EU – a supposedly homogeneous foreign entity – amount to little more than a disposable convenience . now , it is up to the British public to think deeply about the benefits and sacrifices implicit in EU membership .
the Unbearable Lightness of Change
Madrid – Barack Obama ’ s first year in office has been a sobering exercise in the limits of presidential power . it also carries lessons about how the resilient and impersonal forces of history can constrain any leader ’ s drive for change .
the president ’ s domestic agenda is bold and revolutionary , but it clashes frontally with the most fundamental tenets of America ’ s liberal and individualistic ethos . his health-care reform plan , as the Massachusetts vote demonstrated , is perceived as a personal obsession and an entirely unnecessary distraction from much more urgent and vital concerns , such as the financial crisis and unemployment .
but creating a structure of international relations that will make a more stable and enduring world order is not a task to be completed within one year . nor is it at all certain that the sacrifices required of a country already stretched beyond the limits of its financial capabilities , together with the resistance of world powers , will allow this to be accomplished even in a single presidential term .
Iraq is showing some positive signs of political and institutional recovery , but the omens for the future remain , in Obama ’ s own words , “ messy . ” The disintegration of an already fragmented country , the return of civil war , and the shadow of Iran ’ s power being cast over the Iraqi state are all plausible scenarios .
having seen the harsh realities of the world as it really is , he has become the champion of the “ just war . ” In Afghanistan , he opted for a substantial military surge , but the notion of victory that would allow for a withdrawal of troops remains as foggy and uncertain as it was in the case of Iraq .
the Obama administration ’ s failure in re-launching the India-Pakistan peace talks over Kashmir is one of the gravest weaknesses of its “ AfPak ” strategy . if these two countries ’ mutual hostility is not reined in , and a fundamentalist Afghanistan continues to provide the strategic depth through which Pakistan threatens its sworn Indian enemies , the current disaster might still breed defeat .
Israel ’ s fear that the failure of sanctions might bring the United States to accept coexistence with a nuclear-armed Iran in the way it did with the Soviet Union during the Cold War is not entirely unfounded . Obama ’ s administration will not start a war with a third Muslim country while the two others continue to burn .
“ This is as intractable a problem as you get , ” he admitted after a wasted year of more error than trial . he naively ignored the harsh lessons of 20 years of abortive peacemaking , and insisted on sticking to the worn-out paradigm of direct negotiations between parties that , when left to their own devices , are bound to come to a deadlock .
with no breakthrough in the Arab-Israeli conflict , Obama is left with the epicenter of the Middle East ’ s maladies seriously undermining his entire strategy in the region . yet he continues to be the greatest promise for a better world that this political generation can offer .
the Japanese Experiment
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ’ s new government has embraced a revolutionary ( rather than evolutionary ) economic-policy approach that engages several initiatives , some of which were once deemed implausible , unthinkable , or even undesirable . from the doubling of the money supply to additional fiscal stimulus and wide-ranging structural reforms , the new policy paradigm is nothing less than one of the boldest economic-policy experiments in Japan ’ s post-war history .
the Japanese equity market is up an impressive 55 % since hints of the paradigm shift started hitting investors ’ radar screens . at the same time , the Japanese yen has depreciated sharply , including by more than 20 % against the struggling euro .
the surge in the stock market benefits domestic investors , making them likelier to spend more ( what economists call the “ wealth effect ” ) . this , in turn , should revive corporate “ animal spirits , ” leading to higher investment in new plants and equipment , together with higher wages and salaries .
these are , of course , the same mechanisms that the Fed has targeted for almost three years in its own efforts to stimulate higher growth in the US . the macroeconomic outcomes have consistently fallen short of expectations , and there is reason to believe that it will be even more difficult in Japan for monetary policy alone to gain sufficient traction .
the experience of deflation is well entrenched . and , given Japan ’ s high level of public indebtedness , the risks of collateral damage and unintended consequences are potentially higher .
this does not mean that Japan ’ s policy revolution will necessarily disappoint . but , critically , it does mean that even if you believe that the BOJ ’ s actions are necessary for Japan to emerge from its economic malaise , they certainly are not sufficient .
Japan ’ s experiment requires meeting two additional conditions if it is to avoid going the way of previous failed policy initiatives : meaningful structural reforms that essentially change how segments of the economy respond and operate ; and other countries ’ continued acquiescence in the currency depreciation needed to boost the impact of slower-moving domestic dynamics through meaningful gains in global market share .
meeting the first condition is in the hands of Japanese citizens and their elected representatives . the required reforms , though achievable , will test the government ’ s resolve and implementation capabilities , as well as the population ’ s willingness to face immediate disruptions in exchange for the promise of longer-term gains .
the second requirement is very different . it can be achieved only if other countries are willing to sacrifice output , either because they have no choice , or because they believe that , over the medium-term , a stronger Japanese economy will benefit them as the longer-term income effects offset the impact of immediate market disruptions .
but will the rest of the world accommodate Japan ’ s bold policy experiment , or will it take protective steps and thus impede the operation of a crucial policy transmission mechanism ? while initial indications are encouraging , the jury is still out .
many affected countries – including those hit by the trade effects ( such as China , South Korea , Taiwan , and eurozone members ) and those susceptible to the capital-flow channel ( such as Brazil , Indonesia , and Mexico ) – have not yet had enough time to react . Japan ’ s policy change was big and abrupt , and several of the countries on the receiving end have been focused on complex domestic challenges .
a few countries – particularly Brazil , China , and South Korea – have noticed . but their reactions have been generally muted by Japan ’ s success in getting a US-led initiative at the G-20 to classify its policy response as constituting the use of “ domestic tools ” to pursue “ domestic objectives . ”
it is just a matter of time until the rest of the world catches up with the reality of how Japan ’ s experiment affects them . the hope is that , bolstered by evidence of Japan ’ s serious pursuit of structural reforms , they will accommodate the experiment in two ways : by not retaliating , and by undertaking their own domestic reforms that compensate for the output lost to Japan .
the fear is that neither Japan ’ s subsequent actions nor the affected countries ’ domestic realities will justify the risk of lost market share , especially at a time when the global economy as a whole – and global policy coordination – is struggling . here the risk involves currency wars and other beggar-thy-neighbor disruptions .
there is currently insufficient data to predict either outcome confidently . as we await additional evidence , let us appreciate how rarely we witness , in real time , such a momentous policy shift .
the Undeserving One Percent ?
in the popular narrative , the 1 % is thickly populated with unscrupulous corporate titans , greedy bankers , and insider-trading hedge-fund managers . reading some progressive economists , it might seem that the answer to all of America ’ s current problems is to tax the 1 % and redistribute to everyone else .
of course , underlying this narrative is the view that this income is ill-gotten , made possible by Bush-era tax cuts , the broken corporate governance system , and the conflict-of-interest-ridden financial system . the 1 % are not people who have earned money the hard way by making real things , so there is no harm in taking it away from them .
for instance , corporations , especially in the financial sector , reward too many executives richly despite mediocre performance . but apart from tarring too many with the same brush , there is something deeply troubling about this narrative ’ s reductionism .
it ignores , for example , the fact that many of the truly rich are entrepreneurs . it likewise ignores the fact that many of the wealthy are sports stars and entertainers , and that their ranks include professionals such as doctors , lawyers , consultants , and even some of our favorite progressive economists .
but what might be the most important overlooked fact is that the rise in income inequality is not just at the very top , though it is most pronounced there . academic studies suggest that the top tenth percentile of income distribution in the US , and elsewhere , is also moving farther away from the median earner .
Freshly-minted degree holders , especially from lower-quality programs , are finding it particularly hard to get a job nowadays , because they are competing with experienced workers who are also jobless . nevertheless , the unemployment rate for those with degrees is one-third the unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma .
close examination suggests that the single biggest difference between those at or above the top tenth percentile of the income distribution and those below the 50th percentile is that the former have a degree or two while the latter , typically , do not . technological change and global competition have made it impossible for American workers to get good jobs without strong skills .
to acknowledge the fact that the broken educational and skills-building system is responsible for much of the growing inequality that ordinary people experience would , however , detract from the larger populist agenda of rallying the masses against the very rich . it has the inconvenient implication that the poor have a role in pulling themselves out of the morass .
income inequality grew rapidly in the last decade , but consumption inequality did not . the reason : easy credit , especially subprime mortgages , which helped those without means to keep up with the Joneses .
the US needs to improve the quality of its workforce by developing the skills that are relevant to the jobs that its firms are creating . several steps can be taken towards these goals , including improving community attitudes towards education , reforming schools , tying the curriculum in community colleges and vocational institutions more closely to the needs of local firms , making higher education more affordable , and finding effective ways to retrain unemployed workers .
while eliminating inefficient spending , especially inefficient tax subsidies , can generate some of these funds , more tax revenues may be needed . the rich can certainly afford to pay more , but if governments increase taxes on the wealthy , they should do it with the aim of improving opportunities for all , rather than as a punitive measure to rectify an imagined wrong .
the Unexamined Crisis
Chicago – Three years have now passed since the collapse of Lehman Brothers , which triggered the start of the most acute phase of the 2007-2008 financial crisis . is the financial world a safer place today ?
within a month , the US military was on the ground in Afghanistan . within three years the US had an official report on the causes of the events of 9 / 11 ; the well-resourced expert commission that produced it identified the weaknesses of America ’ s national-security agencies and provided recommendations for addressing them .
to be sure , America has the 2,000-page Dodd Frank Act to show for its efforts . unfortunately , few of those pages address any problem suspected to have caused the financial crisis .
bond investors ’ heavy reliance on credit-rating agencies , which tend to be laxer with powerful issuers , has not been fixed . the shadow banking sector ’ s dependence on the official banking sector ’ s liquidity and guarantees , and thus ultimately on the government , has not even been touched .
problems with incentive pay have been ignored . the most highly touted change – the separation between proprietary trading and commercial banking ( also known as the “ Volker rule , ” after former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volker ) – has nothing to do with what caused the crisis , and most likely was approved because it was ineffective .
by contrast , the Rogers Commission , which investigated the causes of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster , produced just one report . the best minds of the time , including the Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman , were part of the investigation , and no stone was left unturned in finding the cause .
the major limits are imposed by the availability of data , not by our methodologies . but the data were not made available , because the interested parties were ( and remain ) afraid to share it , knowing full well what would be revealed .
unfortunately , the Commission – composed mostly of elected officials , rather than experts – wasted its time in political squabbles . its members could not agree even on how to define subprime mortgages and calculate how many such mortgages there were in the United States at the time of the crisis .
after reading through the emails , a congressional report found evidence that the Commission ’ s work was guided by politics rather than fact-finding . after all , the fixes had already been decided and approved , before any fact was found ; the Commission ’ s focus was on supporting or discrediting ( depending on the commissioner ’ s political party ) the Dodd / Frank legislation , rather than on establishing the truth .
was financial institutions ’ assumption of excessive risk the result of incompetence or stupidity , or was it a rational response to the implicit guarantee offered by the government ? did the market see the spread of lax lending standards and price the relevant pools of loans accordingly , or was it fooled ?
unfortunately , they are likely to remain unanswered without a major mandatory disclosure of data . barring that , there is the risk that we will find out what caused this crisis after the next one .
austerity ’ s Children
Washington , DC – When economists discuss “ fiscal adjustment , ” they typically frame it as an abstract and complex goal . but the issue is actually simple : who will bear the brunt of measures to reduce the budget deficit ?
and current indications there suggest that the people most directly in line for a fiscal squeeze are those who are least able to defend themselves – relatively poor children . for example , the current budget sequester ( that is , across-the-board spending cuts ) is already hurting programs like Head Start , which supports pre-school education .
the American comedian Jimmy Kimmel recently poked fun at his compatriots ’ lack of fiscal knowledge by asking pedestrians on Hollywood Boulevard what they thought of &amp; # 160 ; “ Obama ’ s decision to pardon the sequester and send it to Portugal . ” The segment is hilarious , but also sad , because the impact on some people ’ s lives is very real .
perhaps most shocking are the dramatic cuts to the Medicaid health-insurance program that the House of Representatives ’ Republican majority have embraced in their latest budget proposal . Paul Ryan , the chairman of the House Budget Committee , proposes to balance the budget over the next 10 years largely by slashing the program .
this implies that , if anything , the tax system should become more progressive , with the proceeds invested in public goods that are not sufficiently provided by the private sector – &amp; # 160 ; things like early childhood education and preventive health care to minimize educational disruption resulting from common ailments like childhood asthma .
think of it this way : in recent decades , some families chose locations and occupations that seemed to offer a reasonable means of support – and good prospects for their children . many of these decisions turned out badly , largely because information technology ( computers and how they are used ) eliminated many middle-class jobs .
nor is America likely to provide such help in the future , given the coming budget cuts ’ disproportionate impact on children at the lower end of the income distribution .
America can easily afford to do better , of course . its large budget deficits reflect the impact of tax breaks that favor the wealthy and upper middle class ; an unfunded expansion of Medicare coverage to include prescription medicines ; two foreign wars ; and , most important , a banking system that was allowed to get out of control , inflicting massive disruption on the real economy ( and thus on tax revenue ) .
today ’ s children did not play a role in any of these policy mistakes . the preschoolers who are about to lose access to Head Start weren ’ t even born when they were made .
imposing austerity on poor children is not just unfair ; it is also bad economics . when economists , again with their dry jargon , talk about a country ’ s “ human capital , ” what they really mean is the cognitive and physical abilities of its people .
as I pointed out in recent Congressional testimony , poor education leads to poor job prospects , poor families , and back to poor education – if not with a detour through incarceration , which makes it even harder to break the cycle . unfortunately , no one in a position of power is likely to heed such arguments .
when you travel to a foreign country for the first time , and you see neglected , ill-fed , and uneducated children , do you regard that country as likely to be one of the world ’ s great economic powers over the next half-century ? or do you worry for its future ?
the Unfinished Cold War
one year after last summer ’ s war in Georgia , old divisions seem to be re-emerging in a different form . although the Cold War in Europe was declared over , the truth is , it never really finished .
when the Soviet Union withdrew from Central and Eastern Europe , we Russians believed that NATO would not be extended to the countries and territories from which we had withdrawn . our hope was for unification with Europe , a “ common European home , ” and the creation of a Europe “ united and free . ”
but , after a few euphoric years , the West began acting more and more like the Cold War ’ s winners . once the potential “ military threat ” posed by the Soviet Union had vanished into thin air , successive waves of NATO enlargement served neither a military nor an ideological purpose .
the West ’ s logic for enlargement was geopolitical : to bring the former Soviet republics and socialist states of Central and Eastern Europe into the Western sphere of political and economic influence . at first , NATO ’ s new members were declared to have met both democratic and military criteria .
NATO , moreover , not only enlarged its membership , but also transformed itself from an anti-Communist defensive alliance into an offensive grouping ( with operations in Yugoslavia , Iraq and Afghanistan ) . NATO ’ s expansion towards Russia ’ s own borders , and the membership of countries whose elites have historical complexes in regard to Russia , increased anti-Russian sentiment inside the alliance .
no peace treaty ended the Cold War , so it remains unfinished . even though the ideological and military confrontation of those times is far behind us , it is being replaced with a new stand-off – between Russia , on one hand , and the US and some of the “ New Europeans ” on the other .
for the time being , the situation remains open . the US failed to unleash some new form of Cold War after the South Ossetian episode , not least because of the global financial and economic crisis .
it is my hope that the global economic crisis and Barack Obama ’ s presidency will put the farcical idea of a new Cold War into proper perspective . greater Europe , in which I include not only Russia , but also the US , needs a new peace treaty , or rather system of accords , that draw a line under Europe ’ s horrible twentieth century and thus prevent a historical relapse .
what is needed is a new pan-European treaty on collective security , signed either by individual countries or by NATO and the EU , as well as by Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States . countries not included in any of the current security systems would be able to join in the treaty and receive multilateral guarantees .
with the break-up of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in mind , we must seek to prevent the further fragmentation of states , and also their forcible reunification . Kosovo , South Ossetia , and Abkhazia must be the last of the states that break away through force .
once the legacy of confrontation inherited from the twentieth century has been overcome , perhaps deep cuts in the Russia and US nuclear arsenals may become possible , together with coordination of military-strategic policies . in this scenario , Russian-US cooperation in crisis situations like Afghanistan , or in countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , would become much more profound .
in Europe proper , a union between Russia and the EU should be founded , based on a common economic space , a common energy space – with cross-ownership of companies that produce , transport , and distribute energy – and a common human space that would be visa-free and include coordinated Russian and EU international policies .
emphasis should also be placed on establishing a new system for governing the global economy and finance , whose creation will be even more difficult if the confrontations of the Cold War are not resolved .
Europe , Russia , and the US must finish the “ unfinished war . ” Then , perhaps in 2019 , the year that will mark the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles , we may finally bid farewell to the twentieth century .
the Euro on the Mend
a series of policy actions – the creation of a rescue fund , a fiscal treaty , and the provision of cheap liquidity to the banking system – had failed to impress financial markets for long . the crisis had moved from the monetary union ’ s periphery to its core .
in June 2012 , eurozone leaders announced their intention to establish a European banking union . the euro , they said , had to be buttressed by transferring banking supervision to a European authority .
for the first time since the onset of the crisis in Greece , it was officially recognized that the root of the eurozone ’ s problem was not the flouting of fiscal rules , and that the very principles underlying the monetary union had to be revisited . the endeavor was bound to be ambitious .
both measures had an immediate and profound impact on financial markets . seen from Wall Street , the euro was moving closer to becoming a normal currency .
first , the two initiatives resulted in markedly improved borrowing conditions for southern European governments ( at least until Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke created new shockwaves with his indication in mid-June that the US would wind down more than three years of so-called quantitative easing ) . capital stopped flowing out of southern Europe and speculation eased .
second , an agreement on authorizing the ECB to oversee the banking sector was reached at the end of last year . in a year , the new regime will be fully operational – not a trivial achievement in view of the complexity of the issue .
third , discussions are being held to prepare the next steps , namely how to arrange the resolution of failed banks and support for ailing ones . ministers recently agreed upon a template for action .
so there are clear positive outcomes . but questions remain .
one problem is architectural : any banking union is only as strong as its weakest component . what matters for markets is not what happens in normal times , or even what happens when uncertainty and volatility rise ; what markets care about are possible scenarios in truly adverse conditions .
breaking the negative feedback loop between distressed sovereigns and distressed banks – whereby bank rescues exhaust fiscal resources and make it likely that the next financial institution in trouble will not be able to count on government support – requires ensuring that it will not recur even in extreme circumstances . merely “ weakening ” this loop , as European officials recently advocated , could prove deeply insufficient .
one is to exclude bank rescues altogether : only creditors would have to pay for bankers ’ mistakes . this type of rule could insulate governments from banking risk only if applied systematically , even at the expense of financial stability .
the other solution is to mutualize the cost of rescue at the margin . States could be involved and accept losses , but catastrophic risks would have to be shared among all eurozone members .
a compromise is being worked out , but it must pass the test of reality . unfortunately , the middle way between two logically consistent solutions may itself not be a logically consistent one .
the miracle of the OMT scheme is that , since it was announced a year ago , it has had its intended effect without ever being used . strong opposition on the part of the Bundesbank and many German academics , however , has raised questions about whether and how it could ever be used .
to defend its legality in hearings before Germany ’ s Constitutional Court , the ECB itself has argued that the OMT program is a less potent instrument than many believe . although the German government has been adamant that it is not a German court ’ s role to rule on the legality of ECB instruments , markets have taken note .
in a few months , it will be four years since the eurozone crisis began – &amp; # 160 ; almost an eternity by historical standards . much has been done to overcome it .
DNA at 60
London – On April 25 , 1953 , Francis Crick and James Watson published a one-page paper that many believed would revolutionize biological research . building on the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins , they had discovered DNA ’ s double-helix structure , providing the first glimpse into how organisms inherit and store biological information .
the media marked the publication ’ s 60th anniversary with much fanfare , hailing the breakthrough that “ ushered in the age of genetics , ” and calling it “ one of the most important scientific discoveries of all time . ” The British newspaper The Guardian featured the headline , “ Happy Birthday , DNA !
the finding forms the basis of genetics and has opened up promising new research areas , such as synthetic biology , in which biological systems are created or modified to perform specific functions . likewise , it has facilitated important innovations , such as pharmacogenetic cancer treatment , in which drugs target specific genetic defects within cancer cells .
thirteen years later , Gee ’ s prediction looks increasingly unlikely , with the Human Genome Project so far having failed to meet expectations . indeed , in 2010 , the science writer Nicholas Wade lamented that , a decade after the project was launched , geneticists were “ almost back to square one in knowing where to look for the roots of common disease . ”
for example , a 12-year study of 19,000 white American women found that 101 genetic markers that had been statistically linked to heart disease had no predictive value . self-reported family histories , by contrast , proved very accurate in predicting the disease .
as a result , after a few early successes with atypical single-gene disorders such as Huntington ’ s disease , progress has stalled . common variants typically explain a small fraction of genetic risk .
between 1962 and 1985 , cancer-related deaths in the United States rose by 8.7 % , despite the use of aggressive chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy , highlighting the dangers of a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment . an understanding of the genetic determinants of patients ’ therapeutic response , it was believed , would enable doctors to develop individualized treatment programs , sparing more responsive patients from harmful overtreatment .
after sequencing the entire genomes of 50 patients ’ breast cancer tumors , researchers found that only 10 % of the tumors had more than three mutations in common . according to a recent study mapping genetic mutations in 2,000 tumors , breast cancer can actually be divided into ten subgroups .
similarly , a genome-wide analysis of malignant cells from four kidney-cancer patients showed that , while they were related , they had mutated in many different directions . two-thirds of the genetic faults identified were not repeated in the same tumor , let alone in any other metastasized tumors in the body .
Barbara Bradfield , one of the original subjects in research trials for the pharmacogenetic cancer drug Herceptin , has now been stable on the drug for more than 20 years . but such success stories are far too rare to constitute a “ golden age ” of genetics .
the high price of such drugs is limiting their impact as well . Herceptin can cost up to $ 40,000 annually , and newer cancer drugs cost even more , making them prohibitively expensive for most patients .
manufacturers claim that gene patents , which now cover 25-40 % of the human genome , are vital to recouping their investments . but such patents mar DNA ’ s “ birthday ” celebrations for the patients who stand to benefit from the fruits of genetic research – if only they could afford them .
the Ungreening of the World
the exact extent of the damage is difficult to discern , because for many years records were not kept , but the estimates are that 75 % of the world ’ s original forests have been logged or burned by humans . some of them have grown back of course , or have been replanted , but it is thought that we now have only half of the amount of forest land we once had on this planet .
in some places , particularly the drier places of the globe , the deforestation was so severe , and was followed by such intense grazing , that forests have not been able to grow back . the landscape has been permanently altered .
when you imagine Greece , Italy , and Iraq , it is likely that you imagine a dry landscape with open views , the way they look today . historical records indicate , however , that these places were once covered by dense forests .
this march of so-called progress resulting in the loss of forests was documented by John Perlin in his 1989 book A Forest Journey .
so today we sit on a planet with only 50 % of its forest cover remaining . and here ’ s the part that should bring tears to your eyes : we continue to lose more forest cover every year .
the team in charge of assembling the assessment relies on internet reporting and satellite surveillance to come up with the figures . according to the most recent report , between 2000 and 2005 , we lost forest acreage equivalent to the land mass of Panama -- more than 77 thousand square kilometers of forest gone , some of it never to return .
the next report is due to be released in 2010 . I will not be surprised when it is released and I read that the global forest area has continued to shrink .
if this happens when we claim to love trees , I shudder to think what would happen if we were ambivalent about them ? or thought we could live without them ?
before long , the colonies were exporting wood to the many nations that no longer had the timber they needed for ships , casks , shingles , and other construction materials . trees were also cut to clear cropland , provide heat , and the fledgling nation was using up its forests to build its own ironworks and railroads as well .
by 1920 , more than three-quarters of the US ’ s original forests had been cut . similar to the global figures , today the US has only half the forest cover that it had in 1600 .
at the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro it was agreed that , “ efforts should be undertaken towards the greening of the world . ” The UN recognizes that “ forests are essential to economic development and all forms of life . ”
although the UN and my country recognize the value of forests , both ecologically and economically , such recommendations are not strong enough to stop my local council from voting “ yes ” to deforestation . last week , I went to a zoning meeting in the town where I live .
I think it has to do with fear . when a would-be exploiter of trees stands before a politician and requests , or demands , the right to clear a forest , the politician , out of fear , complies .
perhaps that is one of the reasons we really love them . but if we want to do more than love them , if we want to save them , we must become fearless .
the Unilateral Road to Peace
in the next three weeks , the Israeli army will do something unprecedented : instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorism , it will evacuate – by force if necessary – 9,000 Israelis from their homes .
certainly , according to Sharon ’ s thinking , there is no future for 9,000 Jewish settlers living among 1.2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip . hence , in the absence of negotiations , a unilateral withdrawal is the only meaningful step towards de-escalation and stabilization .
this policy has deeply divided Israel : the settlers – mostly , but not exclusively religious – feel betrayed by Sharon , “ The Father of the Settlements . ” It is now the Israeli left that , however reluctantly , realizes that Sharon ’ s new pragmatism may be the first step in the right direction .
the last weeks have seen massive demonstrations , some of them verging on violence ; many of the settlers have declared that they will not obey government orders to evacuate . the army and the police have mobilized almost 50,000 troops to carry out evictions .
two right-wing parties have left his ruling coalition , he has lost his majority within his own Likud Party , and his finance minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , has quit his government . only by bringing Shimon Peres ’ s Labor Party into his cabinet did Sharon manage to retain his parliamentary majority .
many governments were initially skeptical about disengagement , but realized that – as the Washington saying goes – “ this is the only game in town . ” Among them , as well as among the Palestinians , one hears the hope that after the Gaza withdrawal , it will be possible to return to the road map and to resume negotiations leading to a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians .
future negotiations will have to deal with the ultimate borders between Israel and Palestine , the fate of 200,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank , the status of Jerusalem , and with the problem of the 1947-48 Palestinian refugees . on all of these issues , the gulf between the Israeli and Palestinian positions has not narrowed since the failed negotiations at Camp David in 2000 , while fear and distrust have increased .
to attempt negotiations under these circumstances would not only be an exercise in futility , but may merely deepen alienation and suspicion on both sides . the failure of the Annan Plan for Cyprus suggests that good intentions are not enough – and the disagreements in Cyprus were miniscule compared to what divides Israelis and Palestinians .
probably the only rational way to proceed would be to acknowledge that unilateral steps on both sides can still further the cause of de-escalation and ultimate reconciliation . on the Israeli side , further disengagement from dozens of isolated and small settlements on the West Bank , entailing the evacuation of between 20,000 and 30,000 settlers , may be politically feasible and would give the Palestinians a contiguous territory on the West Bank .
on the Palestinian side , consolidation of the Palestinian Authority ’ s control over a dozen security services and militias would be an important step . the Palestinian leader , Abu Mazen , recognizes this , but the question is whether he can deliver .
but in the real world – and Cyprus , Bosnia , and Kosovo may be examples – stabilization and the slow de-escalation of violence can sometimes achieve the same end , even without formal agreement . in the absence of plausible alternatives , one hopes that this will also be the case for Israelis and Palestinians .
the Unraveling of Europe ’ s Peace
Copenhagen – The European Commission recently unveiled long-awaited measures to bring neighboring countries in the Mediterranean and the former Soviet Union closer to Europe . on the same day , another department of the same Commission presented proposals aimed at curbing visa-waiver programs for some non-European nationals .
attracting neighbors has long been a noble aspiration – and something of a European specialty . the European Union ’ s embrace of post-communist republics in Central Europe represented a most powerful symbol of the reach of Western liberal democracy .
in today ’ s neighborhood , where EU expansion is not in the cards , Europe hopes to shore up its presence by opening its huge internal market and increasing assistance . crucially , the Commission ’ s recent proposals include the creation of “ mobility partnerships ” with Tunisia , Morocco , and Egypt , aimed at facilitating travel for local students and businesspeople .
by contrast , the proposed restrictions on the visa-waiver program include “ safeguard clauses ” that would temporarily suspend access to Europe ’ s Schengen area , most likely for those from Balkan countries . this is controversial enough : the decision is motivated by a large influx of asylum-seekers , often offering frivolous reasons , originating from Serbia .
at the same time , with boatloads of migrants arriving from Tunisia , some rather drastic measures have been adopted . a recent dispute between Italy ( the main port of arrival ) and France ( the principal final destination ) ended with the French reintroducing border controls .
to its credit , the European Commission also issued strong calls to member states for better legislation and practices concerning migration . but there is a clear correlation between unrest at the EU ’ s doorstep and Europe ’ s irresistible instinct to keep trouble at arm ’ s length .
the case of Italy is instructive : “ human tsunami ” is the unfortunate phrase used by senior policymakers to warn against the possible flood of migrants . but , almost six months into the North African upheavals , the number of arrivals on the southern island of Lampedusa has reached roughly 30,000 .
the case for openness , inclusion , and diversity in European societies has become much harder to make . not coincidentally , mainstream leaders , from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to British Prime Minister David Cameron , have caught up with the current mood by deeming European multiculturalism a failure .
the genius of modern Europe has consisted in linking long-term stability to the pursuit of ever-deeper economic and political integration . for the past half-century , this has represented Europe ’ s revolutionary recipe for peace , and has served as something of a microcosm of globalization .
one unintended effect of the Arab revolutions is that the link between security and integration that forms Europe ’ s foundation is decoupling . the advantages of pooling sovereignty and resources ring increasingly hollow to ordinary Europeans .
nor is it merely about questioning the sources of Europe ’ s influence in a fast-changing world . unraveling the nexus between security and integration means nothing less than rejecting the formula of Europe ’ s peace .
grand Mal Economics
Europe has slipped back into recession without ever really recovering from the financial / sovereign-debt crisis that began in 2008 . the United States ’ economy is currently growing at 1.5 % per year ( about a full percentage point less than potential ) , and growth may slow , owing to a small fiscal contraction this year .
there are three reasons why the authorities might fail to restore full employment rapidly after a downturn . for starters , unanchored inflation expectations and structural difficulties might mean that efforts to boost demand show up almost entirely in faster price growth and only minimally in higher employment .
the second reason might be that even with anchored inflation expectations ( and thus price stability ) , policymakers do not know how to keep them anchored while boosting the flow of spending in the economy .
over the following century , economists like John Stuart Mill , Walter Bagehot , Irving Fisher , Knut Wicksell , and John Maynard Keynes devised a list of steps to take in order to avoid or cure a depression .
1 . don ’ t go there in the first place : avoid whatever it is – whether external pressure under the gold standard , asset-price bubbles , or leverage-and-panic cycles such as that of 2003-2009 – that creates the desire to deleverage .
2 . if you do find yourself there , stop the desire to deleverage by having the central bank buy bonds for cash , thereby pushing down interest rates , so that holding debt becomes more attractive than holding cash .
3 . if you still find yourself there , stop the desire to deleverage by having the Treasury guarantee risky assets , or issue safe ones , in order to raise the quality of debt in the market ; this , too , will make holding debt more attractive .
4 . if that fails , stop the desire to deleverage by promising to print more money in the future , which would raise the rate of inflation and make holding cash less attractive than spending it .
5 . in the worst case , have the government step in , borrow money , and buy stuff , thereby rebalancing the economy as the private sector deleverages .
there are many subtleties in how governments and central banks should attempt to accomplish these steps . and , indeed , the North Atlantic region ’ s governments and central banks have tried to some degree .
so we remain far short of full employment for the third reason . the issue is not that governments and central banks cannot restore employment , or do not know how ; it is that governments and central banks will not take expansionary policy steps on a large enough scale to restore full employment rapidly .
today ’ s policymakers , so eager to draw a bold line under expansionary measures , should pause and consider the same question .
the Unreality of the “ Real ” Business Cycle
London – Testifying recently before a United States congressional committee , former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said that the recent financial meltdown had shattered his “ intellectual structure . ” I am keen to understand what he meant .
since I have had no opportunity to ask him , I have to rely on his memoirs , The Age of Turbulence , for clues . but that book was published in 2007 – before , presumably , his intellectual structure fell apart .
in his memoirs , Greenspan revealed that his favorite economist was Joseph Schumpeter , inventor of the concept of “ creative destruction . ” In Greenspan ’ s summary of Schumpeter ’ s thinking , a “ market economy will incessantly revitalize itself from within by scrapping old and failing businesses and then reallocating resources to newer , more productive ones . ”
this was the same Greenspan who in 1996 warned of “ irrational exuberance ” and , then , as Fed chairman , did nothing to check it . both the phrase and his lack of action make sense in the light of his ( now shattered ) intellectual system .
it is impossible to imagine a continuous gale of creative destruction taking place except in a context of boom and bust . indeed , early theorists of business cycles understood this .
in classic business-cycle theory , a boom is initiated by a clutch of inventions – power looms and spinning jennies in the eighteenth century , railways in the nineteenth century , automobiles in the twentieth century . but competitive pressures and the long gestation period of fixed-capital outlays multiply optimism , leading to more investment being undertaken than is actually profitable .
banks magnify the boom by making credit too easily available , and they exacerbate the bust by withdrawing it too abruptly . but the legacy is a more efficient stock of capital equipment .
contemporary “ real ” business-cycle theory builds a mountain of mathematics on top of these early models , the main effect being to minimize the “ destructiveness ” of the “ creation . ” It manages to combine technology-driven cycles of booms and recessions with markets that always clear ( i.e. , there is no unemployment ) .
when a positive technological “ shock ” raises real wages , people will work more , causing output to surge . in the face of a negative “ shock , ” workers will increase their leisure , causing output to fall .
bailing out inefficient automobile companies like General Motors only slows down the rate of progress . in fact , whereas most schools of economic thought maintain that one of government ’ s key responsibilities is to smooth the cycle , “ real ” business-cycle theory argues that reducing volatility reduces welfare !
it is hard to see how this type of theory either explains today ’ s economic turbulence , or offers sound instruction about how to deal with it . first , in contrast to the dot-com boom , it is difficult to identify the technological “ shock ” that set off the boom .
second , this type of model strongly implies that governments should do nothing in the face of such “ shocks . ” Indeed , “ real ” business-cycle economists typically argue that , but for Roosevelt ’ s misguided New Deal policies , recovery from the Great Depression of 1929-1933 would have been much faster than it was .
“ My driver is an unemployed Ph.D. graduate , ” he said to Lucas . “ Well , I ’ d say that if he is driving a taxi , he ’ s a taxi-driver , ” replied the 1995 Nobel Laureate .
although Schumpeter brilliantly captured the inherent dynamism of entrepreneur-led capitalism , his modern “ real ” successors smothered his insights in their obsession with “ equilibrium ” and “ instant adjustments . ” For Schumpeter , there was something both noble and tragic about the spirit of capitalism .
the UN ’ s Mandate Gap
the United Nations peacekeeping operations now underway in Lebanon offer a big opportunity for the UN to demonstrate its relevance and impact on the world stage in the 21st century . if only those member states who claim to be the UN ’ s biggest supporters put their money where their mouths are .
many world leaders , particularly those in Europe , decry the Bush administration ’ s undermining of the UN , especially since 2003 . yet leaders in France , who expressed outrage when the US sidestepped the UN and invaded Iraq without the international community ’ s blessing , stunned the world in August when they backed down from their promise to send 2,000 peacekeepers to intervene in southern Lebanon , and instead only committed 200 .
but Europe ’ s response , like the US response in other cases , highlights a critical issue for all supporters of the UN and international institutions more generally . if we cannot do what it takes to make them more effective , we will increasingly find that nations will bypass them altogether .
it thus set the stage for UN officials to establish the “ Rules of Engagement ” ( ROEs ) for its peacekeepers , which dictate when and under what circumstances UN troops can fire their weapons to defend themselves . but as the current UN mission in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) well knows , defending yourself is not the same as protecting yourself from hostile fire in the first place .
in this context , the French are understandably worried about the fate of their soldiers – soldiers charged with supporting the Lebanese government in its efforts to establish control over the Hezbollah-controlled south . the terrible French peacekeeping experience in Bosnia in the early 1990s , in which France lost 84 soldiers serving in a humanitarian capacity under restrictive ROEs , justifies their fears .
in the heat of an international crisis , the Security Council passes resolutions to great public fanfare , establishing an official UN “ mandate . ” But then the UN Secretary General is left , resolution in hand , to ask UN member states for the actual , tangible resources necessary to implement what has been commanded .
a 2006 UN mandate review finds that UN member states adopt hundreds of mandates each year , conferring “ additional responsibilities with neither corresponding funds nor guidance ” on how resources should be used . in American domestic politics , these kinds of commands from the US Congress to states are known as “ unfunded mandates ; ” ordering results without providing the resources necessary to achieve them .
the UN ’ s experience in Lebanon is not encouraging . according to the UN ’ s Department of Peacekeeping Operations , up to now UNIFIL has operated on an annual budget of $ 94 million and suffers chronic budget shortfalls due to unpaid assessments from member states .
even if all 15,000 UN troops could be found and deployed , the challenges in Lebanon will remain daunting . the UN insists that Resolution 1701 does
that is only the military aspect of the peacekeeping effort . Lebanon ’ s infrastructure – especially in the south – has been decimated .
but today the international community has a tremendous window of opportunity to secure a small but significant peace in the Middle East along the volatile border of Lebanon and Israel . how member states respond now – especially those who believe in the purpose and value of the UN - may help shape the outcomes of other , wider ongoing regional conflicts , notably with Iran and Syria , both of which support Hezbollah .
the UN provides the mechanism for a global response , but as Kofi Annan often repeats , it does not exist apart from its member states . it is up to those members – to all of our governments - to provide both the necessary will and the required resources .
the UN Takes Charge
the downturn in the US began with a failure in the financial system , which quickly was translated into a slowdown in the real economy . but , in the developing world , it is just the opposite : a decline in exports , reduced remittances , lower foreign direct investment , and precipitous falls in capital flows have led to economic weakening .
on June 23 , a United Nations conference focusing on the global economic crisis and its impact on developing countries reached a consensus both about the causes of the downturn and why it was affecting developing countries so badly . it outlined some of the measures that should be considered and established a working group to explore the way forward , possibly under the guidance of a newly established expert group .
one might have thought that the United States would have taken a leadership role , since the crisis was made there . indeed , the US Treasury ( including some officials who are currently members of President Barack Obama ’ s economic team ) pushed capital- and financial-market liberalization , which resulted in the rapid contagion of America ’ s problems around the world .
while there was less American leadership than one would have hoped , indeed expected under the circumstances , many participants were simply relieved that America did not put up obstacles to reaching a global consensus , as would have been the case if George W. Bush were still president .
one might have hoped that America would be the first to offer large amounts of money to help the many innocent victims of the policies it had championed . but it did not , and Obama had to fight hard to extract even limited amounts for the International Monetary Fund from a reluctant Congress .
the implication is that they need grants , not loans . the G-20 , which turned to the IMF to provide most of the money that the developing countries need to cope with the crisis , did not take sufficient note of this ; the UN conference did .
the build-up of reserves contributes to global imbalances and insufficient global aggregate demand , as countries put aside hundreds of billions of dollars as a precaution against global volatility . not surprisingly , America , which benefits by getting trillions of dollars of loans from developing countries – now at almost no interest – was not enthusiastic about the discussion .
on the last day of the conference , as America was expressing its reservations about even discussing at the UN this issue which affects all countries ’ well being , China was once again reiterating that the time had come to begin working on a global reserve currency . since a country ’ s currency can be a reserve currency only if others are willing to accept it as such , time may be running out for the dollar .
emblematic of the difference between the UN and the G-20 conferences was the discussion of bank secrecy : whereas the G-20 focused on tax evasion , the UN Conference addressed corruption , too , which some experts contend gives rise to outflows from some of the poorest countries that are greater than the foreign assistance they receive .
but this crisis has shown that they have not managed globalization as well as they should have . if globalization is to work for everyone , decisions about how to manage it must be made in a democratic and inclusive manner – with the participation of both the perpetrators and the victims of the mistakes .
the UN , notwithstanding all of its flaws , is the one inclusive international institution . this UN conference , like an earlier one on financing for developing countries , demonstrated the key role that the UN must play in any global discussion about reforming the global financial and economic system .
the UN to the Rescue on Climate Change
there is no unanimity requirement or veto in the General Assembly , which might well be why it has not been called upon in the effort to fight climate change . yet the General Assembly is the only place where obstruction by major countries – for example , by China and the United States at December ’ s global climate talks in Copenhagen – can be bypassed .
a “ Conference of Parties ” ( COP ) has met almost every year since the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro . these meetings are often technical and the discussions are usually among ambassadors .
one might recall that many delegations arrived in Kyoto resignedly willing to accept the idea of a tax on greenhouse-gas emissions , or at least on carbon dioxide , the most commonly encountered greenhouse gas . the US delegation , dispatched by a government intent on reducing state intervention in the economy , declared itself vehemently opposed to the idea .
the US delegation suggested a totally different scheme from the one being discussed . in the US scheme , the volume of emissions would be subject to permits or quotas , which could be traded in a market established for that purpose .
in the end , that scheme was chosen in Kyoto with the hope that the US , which had proposed it , would then ratify it . China and India were absent at the time , and Russia was hostile to the idea .
the European Union was the only group of nations that seriously considered implementing it . a European quota system , limited to electricity producers and materials manufacturers , the two major sources of emissions , has been in place since 2005 .
a four-page document was vaguely approved by acclamation but not submitted to a vote . it expressed the hope that international action will aim at limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius in the course of the twenty-first century , but it says nothing about how to achieve this – no commitments on the quantity of emissions , and no system for global measurement or supervision .
with no government commitments , there can be no attempt to limit carbon emissions effectively , which implies that when the world does begin to take action , it will be that much more difficult to slow the pace of climate change and mitigate its effects . moreover , Europe has been left uncertain about its own system of quotas , which has not functioned particularly well in the first place .
more than half of the 43 members of the Association of Small Island States believe that the decision to do nothing , to let ocean waters rise , can be considered tantamount to approval of murder . the smallest among them , Tuvalu , with 11,000 inhabitants , is already searching for a place to evacuate its citizens when their island is submerged .
most of the potential climate refugees will end up in huge zones of increasing dryness – the Middle East , the Mediterranean region , central China , and the US . some predict that this migration will take place as soon as the second half of this century .
but the next one will probably lead to a serious settling of scores . indeed , people and governments need to express their anger at the fact that no binding agreement was reached in Copenhagen , despite the willingness of many of those who were present .
fortunately , enough was accomplished in Copenhagen to re-boot the process . but that re-boot must start now , and the UN , specifically the General Assembly , is the place to begin .
the UN was not responsible for the failure in Copenhagen , and it should not act as if it was . it must now use its power as the world ’ s parliament to overcome the obstructions of the few .
Pakistan ’ s Tipping Point
on May 11 , some 40-50 million voters will elect a new national assembly . the outcome , preceded by a spike in extremist violence , is likely to reverberate far and wide .
Pakistan ’ s homegrown terrorist groups know that the country is at a tipping point , and are attacking candidates and voters who favor a secular state . hundreds of people have already been killed , and more will undoubtedly die before Election Day , targeted because , if these groups prevail , they would push what is sometimes called the “ idea of Pakistan ” to its logical – and extreme – conclusion .
some 70 years ago , Muhammad Ali Jinnah , Pakistan ’ s founding father , launched the movement to create an independent state for the Muslims of British India . the British colonial administration finally acquiesced , creating a country out of Muslim-majority areas .
that composition changed dramatically with the partition of the new states of India and Pakistan in 1947 , when 14 million people moved across the newly drawn border . eight million Muslim refugees fled India and entered Pakistan , and six million Hindus and Sikhs moved in the opposite direction .
over time , an increasing proportion of this population began to demand the creation of an Islamic state in the areas that were now Pakistan . the upcoming election will determine how far the country will go along this route .
by contrast , other large Muslim countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have succeeded in establishing political orders that serve all segments of highly diverse populations reasonably well . that may eventually happen in the western Islamic world as well , but only after a struggle of the type occurring now in Pakistan .
the large countries in this part of the Islamic world – most notably Egypt , Pakistan , and Turkey – are attempting to address four problems , the most challenging of which is to define Islam ’ s role in the political system .
a conservative ruling party with deep religious roots is content to leave religion to private observance , with no direct influence on public policy . the issue remains less settled in Egypt , while in Pakistan a small but highly motivated part of the population has embraced extreme violence as a form of political expression .
the role of the military in politics also needs to be resolved . once again , Turkey has taken the lead ; in both Egypt and Pakistan , the men in uniform have returned to their barracks , but they have not lost influence over public policy .
if Sunnis triumph there , they may become more assertive in countries that have large Shia populations . it is not often recognized that Pakistan has the world ’ s second-largest Shia population , after Iran , with roughly 50 million adherents .
the old post-Ottoman “ grand bargain ” – Western acceptance of authoritarianism in exchange for the secure flow of oil , use of sensitive sea-lanes , and some tolerance for the existence of Israel – has broken down . what replaces it will be determined by the shape of the new political order that finally emerges in the western Islamic world .
there is growing recognition , some of it grudging , that the coalition led by the Pakistan People ’ s Party has managed to create a political structure built on fairly stable foundations . this is a real accomplishment in a country that was on a political roller-coaster for most of its history .
for the last five years , Pakistan ’ s annual GDP growth has averaged just 3 % – half the rate needed to absorb two million new labor-force entrants every year . if growth does not pick up , the ranks of the unemployed and underemployed will swell , increasing the size of the pool from which extremist groups find fresh recruits .
the upcoming election has both nurtured hope and generated anxiety among Pakistanis . it could go either way .
civilizing the City
our metropolises are the engines of growth for a global economy emerging from the shadow of financial crisis . in Bangalore , my home , investment is pouring into a city at the forefront of the Indian economy ’ s transformation – home to companies like Infosys and Wipro , and named by Forbes Magazine as one of the “ Fastest Growing Cities of the Next Decade . ”
but , as Bangalore ’ s citizens prepare to go to the polls in state elections , their concerns are not merely economic . the city ’ s financial success stories mask a darker reality – quality of life for many city-dwellers has deteriorated over recent years .
the movement of the rural poor to large cities is one of the exemplary narratives of the modern era . and governments , which typically focus on crude measures of economic performance , encourage rapid urbanization .
in China , for example , the relaxation of migration controls in the 1980 ’ s and the opening of the economy led to the spectacular growth of the country ’ s eastern cities . more than 50 % of Chinese live in urban areas today , up from 25 % in 1990 , and the proportion is expected to reach 70 % by 2035 .
while the majority of Indians still live in rural areas , this , too , is changing fast . from 1970 to 2010 , India ’ s urban population grew by 250 million .
but cities are simply unable to cope with the influx of migrants on the current scale . the fast-growing metropolises of India , China , Brazil , and other major emerging economies offer plenty of jobs , but basic amenities are lacking ; as a result , many of the urban poor live in slums , without adequate health care , water supplies , or electricity .
municipalities , often owing to corruption or poor management , are unable or unwilling to impose rigorous planning regulations . infrastructure spending is either inadequate or poorly targeted .
the novelty of the rapid economic improvements seen by many city-dwellers in India , China , and elsewhere over the past ten years has insulated governments from the repercussions of poor urban planning . as I take my morning strolls through Bangalore , though , I sense growing resentment of the inadequacies , and frustration at insufficient improvements in citizens ’ quality of life .
democracy exists precisely to remedy the kinds of injustices I hear from the hardworking Bangaloreans I encounter on the street and online . Bangalore is a modern city , and its citizens are expressing their displeasure in modern ways – on Facebook , in chat rooms , and on Twitter .
already , there have been major strikes at factories across China – Motorola , Honda , and Foxconn , among others . that would have been unheard of several years ago , as would today ’ s growing trend among China ’ s urban middle classes for de-urbanization – a brain drain whereby educated city dwellers give up on the rat race and return to the countryside in pursuit of cleaner air , open spaces , and better accommodation .
the urban sprawl of Delhi , Mumbai , Chennai , and Bangalore has continued unchecked , unplanned , and with under-investment in infrastructure for far too long . urban pollution contributed to 620,000 needless deaths in India last year , mainly among the very poor .
the consultancy McKinsey argues in a recent report that India needs to invest at least $ 1.2 trillion in its urban infrastructure over the next two decades , or $ 134 per capita annually . it currently invests only $ 17 per capita , compared to $ 116 in China and $ 292 in the United States .
but , despite the grumbling , India ’ s city dwellers – like those elsewhere – do not want to sacrifice the enormous gains of the past few decades to ineffective or corrupt governance . they want to work toward a future in which their quality of life is among the best in the world , with green spaces , sustainable public transport , clean air , well-built houses , and safe streets .
it is important to recognize those who are contributing to the vision of a city that is feted not just for its economic successes , but also for its quality of life . their example is one that emerging-country urbanites everywhere should seek to emulate .
globalizing the Security Council
at the end of a global war that claimed more than 50 million lives , the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as the world ’ s two major powers . the UN Charter , initially negotiated by the US , the Soviet Union , and the United Kingdom during World War II , established a Security Council containing five permanent members , including France and the Republic of China .
at its inception , the UN brought together 51 countries ; it now has 193 member states . but , although the Security Council was enlarged in 1965 by increasing the number of non-permanent seats from six to ten , its permanent members have not changed since 1945 .
in addition to interstate conflict and the proliferation of weapons – particularly weapons of mass destruction – new challenges have emerged , such as terrorism and the involvement of non-state actors in internal conflicts . meanwhile , the global distribution of economic and political power has undergone a radical reconfiguration , setting the stage for the emergence of a multipolar international order .
in this environment , the Security Council ’ s frozen composition is imposing significant limits on the international community ’ s capacity to address global challenges . conflicts drag on without proper action from the body created to resolve them .
a majority of UN member states are in favor of creating a new Council with an expanded roster of both permanent and non-permanent members . this majority reflects a growing perception that the world would be more stable and more secure with a strengthened and updated multilateral system .
a reformed Security Council would reflect the emergence of new powers and their readiness to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security . in the financial and economic arena , this new multipolarity has already led to quota reforms at the International Monetary Fund and resulted in the consolidation of the G-20 as the premier venue for multilateral economic-policy coordination .
entire regions of the world , such as Africa and Latin America , are excluded from the nucleus of decision-making . a governing body that is not representative fuels uncertainty and frustration among those subject to its decisions , undermining the legitimacy – and thus the effectiveness – of its actions .
the greatest risk that we run is erosion of the Security Council ’ s credibility , and , with it , a diminishing capacity to confront grave threats to peace . we all stand to lose if new international crises end up being addressed by coalitions of countries at the margins of the Security Council and in a manner that flouts international law .
in any conflict , neighboring countries ’ participation and commitment are indispensable to the achievement of peace . only an expanded Security Council can enable effective conflict resolution worldwide .
the international community cannot afford to postpone reform . it is our duty to preserve the multilateral system of peace and security – an achievement of the international community that , despite its shortcomings , has helped save the planet from another war on a global scale .
only an increase in the number of permanent and non-permanent seats can remedy the representation deficit within the Security Council and adapt it to the realities of the twenty-first century . if new members and regions are not offered a seat at the table , the Council will face increasing irrelevance – and the world , more than ever in need of effective conflict resolution , will be far worse off .
America ’ s Health-Care Divide
Berkeley – In 1883 , the authoritarian imperial government of Prince Otto von Bismarck – who famously declared , “ It is not by speeches and majority votes that the great issues of our time will be decided … but by blood and iron ” – established national health insurance for Germany .
the rationale for national health insurance is as clear now as it was to Bismarck 130 years ago . a country ’ s success – whether measured by the glory of its Kaiser , the expansion of its territory , the security of its borders , or the well-being of its population – rests on the health of its people .
serious illness can strike anyone , and seriously ill people , as a rule , do not earn much money . the longer the seriously ill are untreated , the more costly their eventual treatment and maintenance become .
private savings , as a rule , can pay the costs of treatment only for the thrifty and the well-off . so , unless we adopt the view that those without ample savings who fall seriously ill should quickly die ( and so decrease the surplus population ) , a country with national health insurance will be a wealthier and more successful country .
back in 2009 , President Barack Obama could have proposed a program as comprehensive as the one initiated by Bismarck . such a program could have allowed , encouraged , and made it affordable for uninsured Americans to obtain health insurance similar to what members of Congress have ; or it simply could have expanded the existing Medicare system for those over 65 to cover all Americans .
not a single Republican voted for the Affordable Care Act in the House of Representatives . one Republican senator – Olympia Snowe of Maine – voted for it in committee , but then switched sides , threatened to kill it via filibuster , and voted against its final passage .
as for Romney , he refused to recognize any kinship between his bill and the ACA – sort of like when he refused to recognize details surrounding the participation in the 2012 Olympics of a Dressage horse that he owned ,
they have also refused the federal dollars earmarked to expand their state-level Medicaid programs . and they have refused to lift a finger to establish the “ exchanges ” that are supposed to give individuals and small businesses the same access to health insurance at competitive prices that employees of large businesses get via their companies ’ benefits departments .
what will doctors and hospital administrators in Phoenix , Kansas City , Houston , and Atlanta do after they talk to their colleagues in Los Angeles , Seattle , Minneapolis , Chicago , Baltimore , and New York , where state governments and political structures are trying to make ACA implementation a success ? will they compare and contrast the conditions under which they are working ?
America ’ s partisan heat is about to be turned up over the next several election cycles , as the blame game begins . Bismarck would know who is at fault .
the Sino-American Test in North Korea
but the situation also offers an important opportunity : a gain in strategic trust between China and the United States , the two countries with the capacity to resolve the tensions once and for all . if they manage to cooperate constructively in order to shape a peace acceptable to all sides , this would make not only Korea , but also the region and the world , a safer place .
ten years after opting out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , North Korea clearly possesses nuclear weapons . the regime ’ s nuclear test in February – its third since 2006 – was likely a miniaturized device , which makes the situation even more worrying , given that successful miniaturization is critical for using nuclear weapons in ballistic missiles .
February ’ s test provoked another round of United Nations sanctions , drafted by the US and China , triggering an escalation of threats and provocations from the North . the tension on the peninsula increased further with the annual joint military exercises conducted by the US and South Korea – especially when American nuclear-capable B-52 and B-2 bombers were added to the drills .
likewise , regional stability is a prerequisite of China ’ s stellar economic growth , and military conflict would be a setback for US economic rebirth as well . indeed , with US defense spending finally set to decline after a decade of debt-financed war in Iraq and Afghanistan , America has little fiscal room for an unforeseen military entanglement .
Sino-North Korean relations have borne a significant scar since 1991 , when China recognized South Korea without insisting that the US formally recognize the North . the North Koreans believe that China sacrificed them for commercial interests , and bilateral relations have yet to recover .
first , the regime ’ s implosion would unleash a massive refugee flow , implying enormous social and economic costs . moreover , Asia remains a continent defined by balance-of-power diplomacy , border conflicts , and historic mistrust , with no multilateral security structures to soften regional tensions .
in this environment , mistrust of China ’ s rise as a regional hegemon in much of East Asia only intensifies the need for active Chinese participation in promoting regional stability and peace – a peace framework with Asian roots , acceptable to all parties . only through such efforts will China be able to increase its international legitimacy , thereby minimizing the risk of future conflict .
the US must reiterate clearly that indefinitely prolonging the status quo on the Korean Peninsula would imply a strategic loss for China , and that China must join the international community in its efforts to halt North Korea ’ s nuclear program . this cooperation is the only way to force the North ’ s hand and put an end to the incessant cycle of crisis and mounting risk .
the current crisis offers a unique test case for joint handling of international affairs – or , in this case , regional affairs with global consequences – by the world ’ s two biggest powers . during US Secretary of State John Kerry ’ s trip to China this month , the two countries pronounced their shared goals : denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and durable peace in the region .
this is a good starting point . Sino-US cooperation on this flashpoint could be a huge step forward in building much-needed bilateral strategic trust .
but the two countries ’ markedly different foreign-policy approaches will not facilitate matters . while the US tends to segment problems in order to find solutions to each part within a finite period of time , China relies on broad , long-term perspective and views issues as extended , relative processes .
that is why , in dealing with impoverished , isolated , nuclearized North Korea , where Sino-US cooperation is the only option , the US and China face both a challenge and an opportunity .
American Presidential Beauty
when former French President Nicolas Sarkozy faced his Socialist challenger , François Hollande , that was a debate – addressing substantive issues and lasting more than two hours . by contrast , presidential debates in the United States are more like staged performances , where the answers to every possible question have been rehearsed endlessly with teams of coaches and advisers .
the candidates in US debates address carefully selected journalists who rarely follow up on a question . and the candidates ’ performances are scrutinized less on the substance of their arguments than on their presentation , body language , facial tics , unguarded sighs , smiles , sneers , and inadvertent eye rolling .
after all , Richard Nixon ’ s race against John Kennedy in 1960 is said to have been lost on television : Kennedy looked cool and handsome , while Nixon scowled into the camera , with sweat trickling down his five o ’ clock shadow . in his debates with Ronald Reagan in 1980 , Jimmy Carter came across as smug and humorless , and Reagan as a friendly old uncle .
in 2000 , Al Gore , was unable to make up his mind about which role he wished to play in his debates with George W. Bush , so he looked shifty and inauthentic , changing from arrogant to patronizing and back again . he had the better arguments , but he lost the “ debates ” ( and the election ) nonetheless .
we are told that the debates this month between President Barack Obama and the Republican challenger , Mitt Romney , might decide the election . it is , according to the pundits , Romney ’ s last chance .
according to public-opinion polls , only about 17 % of eligible voters have not yet made up their minds about which candidate to support . that is surprising , given the widening political gap between America ’ s two main political parties .
then there is the great unspoken factor of racial prejudice , something even hard-core right-wing Republicans try not to express openly . a certain percentage of American voters will not vote for a black man , whatever he says , or however good he looks in a debate .
if policies or prejudices have not persuaded that undecided 17 % of voters , they must be looking for something else . they want to see whether they like one man better than the other .
in past elections , when there sometimes really was not much political difference between Democrats and Republicans , this made a certain sense . broadly speaking , on economics and foreign policy , the candidates often would be in accord , with Republicans more inclined to favor the interests of big business and Democrats defending the interests of labor .
after all , the US presidency is a quasi-monarchical institution , as well as a political one . the president and First Lady are the king and queen of the American republic – the official faces that the US presents to the outside world .
it is not utterly absurd , therefore , that voters want to like the look of their presidents , quite apart from the merit of their policies . choosing the country ’ s most powerful politician on the basis of his presentability on television might seem arbitrary , even frivolous .
and the man whom US voters choose to lead their country will affect the lives of everyone , not just Americans . because non-Americans cannot vote in US elections for him ( a pity for Obama , who would probably win a global vote by a landslide ) , we have to depend on the judgment of that 17 % of undecided voters watching television this month .
good or bad , the quasi-king can be booted out every four years . then the competition – part ideological , part beauty contest – can start all over again .
the US Candidates ’ Non-Debate
both candidates received some ( well-deserved ) criticism during the conventions for appealing to peoples ’ emotions instead of addressing facts and policies . in the debates , that should change as they confront each other directly while making their case to voters .
but October 3 is only the beginning . the vice-presidential candidates will square off on October 11 , while Obama and Romney will meet again on October 16 and then for the last debate , on October 22 .
foreign policy has made few appearances in the campaign , but the final debate is supposed to be devoted to the subject , thereby giving voters a sustained view of how the candidates view the world . Obama has spoken periodically over the course of his presidency about foreign policy ( albeit before the current campaign ) , whereas Romney has said far less .
on Iran , the debate will , at best , address how to “ solve ” ( no one will dare say manage ) the nuclear threat by using sanctions and military action . a serious discussion of how to sustain fledgling multinational negotiations between Iran and the world ’ s six most powerful countries ( the so-called P5 + 1 ) – a process denounced by many American pundits as a waste of time – is unlikely .
indeed , Iran ’ s nuclear aspirations , one of the most pressing issues of our time , may well be reduced to whether the US should support Israel in the event that its government takes military action . one is hard pressed to find any analyst who believes that Israeli air strikes could do more than set back Iran ’ s program for a few months while unifying fractured Iranian opinion around support for nuclear weapons .
most Americans have not yet embraced the idea that the US-China relationship is too big to fail . today ’ s China seems to recall Winston Churchill ’ s description of Russia as a “ riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma ” – a new , great power rival that is difficult for US policymakers to understand .
in the meantime , Syria and its daily carnage have become the dreariest and most numbing foreign-policy issue in American public opinion , despite the danger that the violence could spread across the Middle East ( particularly to neighboring Iraq and Lebanon ) . the export of Syria ’ s civil war is likely to consume far more time in the coming months than either candidate wants to admit .
joint US-Chinese effort on this issue could potentially provide the elusive key to an improved relationship . yet this issue , too , is unlikely to receive the attention from the candidates that it deserves .
whether Americans like it or not , with Europe , China , and India largely consumed by domestic politics , international leadership and stewardship of the world ’ s problems will remain firmly in US hands . and yet the US election campaign , even the upcoming October debates , will leave most observers wondering whether any country is in charge .
China and the American Dream
Paris – China may be just a few years away from becoming the world ’ s leading economic power , and America ’ s strategic centrality may be on the wane ( certainly , no one speaks of the United States today as the world ’ s “ hyperpower ” ) . but America still makes people dream , and its emotional hold on the world remains unique .
in this sense , last week brought two victories : not just Barack Obama ’ s over Republican challenger Mitt Romney in the presidential election , but also the victory of America ’ s democratic system over China ’ s one-party authoritarianism . in a few sentences of his victory speech – the space of a magic moment – Obama celebrated “ the mystery of democracy ” in a very concrete , but also nearly religious manner .
Obama found the right words with which to pay tribute to the multitude of anonymous citizens going door to door to convince their fellow Americans to vote for their preferred candidates . he was describing democracy at its best , its most noble , as it should be , but not always is : freely mobilized men and women able and willing to change the course of their destiny .
at this moment , however brief , America ’ s soft power defeated by a knockout that of China , which less than one day later solemnly – and in the most opaque manner – opened the 18th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party . millions of people around the world would rather experience for themselves an election night like America ’ s than become a part of China ’ s long-term plans .
it is far too indebted to be the ultimate strategic and economic insurance policy for its allies , as it was in the past . but , if America ’ s protective power has receded , its power to inspire remains unique and can still redound to its benefit in the most spectacular way .
Obama ’ s victory was not only that of democracy , but also of a certain vision and message of America . by keeping an open stance on immigration , maintaining a respectful discourse toward all who want to live out their differences freely , and considering women in a modern and dignified manner , Obama was able to mobilize the strength of America ’ s exceptionalism , which rests on one key word : diversity .
in deliberately ignoring this diversity and embracing nostalgia for a long-gone past , the Republican Party – led astray by its ultra-conservative lunatics – was far more responsible than its decent candidate for the defeat . Romney ’ s mistake was to align himself for too long with ideas that were too radical for him – and for America .
the fate of Romney ’ s &amp; # 160 ; candidacy contains a universal message for all democratic regimes : one wins nothing by cultivating the extremes or by becoming their captive . in fact , one runs the risk of losing not only one ’ s soul , but also elections .
the cost of this election cycle surpassed $ 2 billion – all to reproduce the status quo : the same president , and the same balance of power in the US Congress . money has become a corrosive agent that is eroding and redefining the democratic process , with the mobilization of personal energies giving way to the enlargement of campaign budgets .
“ Vetocracy ” – reflected in the Republicans ’ routine Congressional obstructionism in Obama ’ s first term – is a threat to democracy . will the party , chastened by its electoral defeat , recognize that its responsibility is to the American people , and not only to its members and followers ?
Obama ’ s reelection sends a message , but one that will resonate widely – including at home – only if rhetoric does not depart from reality , as was too often the case during Obama ’ s first term . America cannot continue to live with the injustices of its health-care system or with crumbling and obsolete infrastructure .
at the same time , while America may no longer be the international actor that it once was , domestic production of shale oil and gas appears set to re-write the US energy equation – as it could for France and other Western countries , which may one day be able to do without the energy supplied by the Middle East .
America ’ s main challenge globally is to accept that it will no longer be alone at the top . it has never had to deal with others as equals , unlike traditional European powers , which have done so for centuries .
in 1989 , large numbers of Chinese students took over Tiananmen Square to demand more rights , adopting a symbol resembling the Statue of Liberty . today , too , it is not America ’ s military strength that threatens or challenges China , but rather the enduring attraction of “ the &amp; # 160 ; American dream . ”
America ’ s Third-World Politics
Cambridge – With its presidential election over , the United States can finally take a breather from campaign politics , at least for a while . but an uncomfortable question lingers : how is it possible for the world ’ s most powerful country and its oldest continuous democracy to exhibit a state of political discourse that is more reminiscent of a failed African state ?
if you think I exaggerate , you have not been paying close attention . the pandering to extremist groups , the rejection of science , the outright lies and distortions , and the evasion of the real issues that characterized the most recent election cycle set a new low for democratic politics .
without question , the worst offenders are America ’ s Republicans , whose leaders have somehow become enraptured by ideas that are beyond the pale in other advanced countries . of the party ’ s dozen presidential candidates , only two ( Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman ) declined to reject scientific evidence concerning global warming and its human causes .
the Darwinian theory of evolution has long been a dirty word among Republicans as well . Rick Perry , the governor of Texas and an early frontrunner in the Republican primary , called it just a “ theory out there , ” while Romney himself has had to argue that it is consistent with creationism – the idea that an intelligent force designed the universe and brought it into being .
yet , this idea , too , has strong support within the Republican Party – led by Ron Paul , another contender for the party ’ s presidential nomination . no one was surprised when the party ’ s platform gave a nod to the Gold Standard in its convention in August .
most non-Americans would find it crazy that neither Romney nor Barack Obama supported stricter gun-control laws ( with Obama making an exception only for assault weapons such as AK-47s ) , in a country where it is sometimes easier to buy guns than it is to vote . most Europeans cannot understand how , in a civilized country , both candidates can favor the death penalty .
candidate Romney was so cowed by his party ’ s obsession with low taxes that he never put forth a budget that added up . it was left to his spinners to explain , as The Economist put it , that this was “ necessary rubbish , concocted to persuade the fanatics who vote in the Republican primaries . ”
Obama , for his part , catered to economic nationalists by attacking Romney as an “ outsourcing pioneer ” and calling him an “ outsourcer in chief ” – as if outsourcing were evil , could be stopped , or Obama himself had done much to discourage it .
so rampant were the equivocations , untruths , and outright lies from both camps that many media outlets and non-partisan groups maintained running lists of factual distortions . one of the best known , FactCheck.org , an initiative of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania , confessed that this campaign had kept them exceptionally busy .
none of these claims was true . &amp; nbsp ;
“ It ’ s been that sort of campaign , ” FactCheck.org ’ s analysts wrote , “ filled from beginning to end with deceptive attacks and counterattacks , and dubious claims . ” &amp; nbsp ;
meanwhile , over the course of three televised presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate , climate change , the signature issue of our time and the most serious problem confronting our planet , was not mentioned even once .
one is that the US will ultimately be undone by the poor quality of its democratic discourse , and that it is merely at the start of an inevitable decline . the symptoms are there , even if the disease has not yet infected the entire body .
campaigns are always a time for cheap populism and kowtowing to single-issue fundamentalists . perhaps what really matters is what happens after a candidate takes office : the quality of the checks and balances within which he or she operates , the advice offered , the decisions taken , and , ultimately , the policies pursued .
but , if American elections are nothing other than entertainment , why is so much money spent on them , and why do so many people get so exercised over them ? can the answer be that the outcome would be even worse otherwise ?
to paraphrase Winston Churchill , elections are the worst way to select a political leader , save for all other methods that have been tried – and nowhere more so than in America .
America ’ s Unconfirmed Hostages
Denver – The United States Constitution , which turned 225 years old last summer , is a remarkable document : the provisions of a text written in the eighteenth century continue to guide twenty-first-century governance . we will be reminded of the implications of that in the coming weeks , as President Barack Obama fills senior positions in his second-term administration .
article II of the Constitution stipulates presidential powers that require the “ advice and consent of the Senate , ” including the nomination of senior officials . probably nobody , 225 years ago , had any idea that the number of officials deemed to require Senate confirmation would eventually exceed 1,400 , or that Senate confirmation would involve a vetting process that often takes years to complete .
indeed , many people believe that the Senate confirmation process is broken . they have only to point to the failed attempt to nominate Susan Rice , the US ambassador to the United Nations , to be Hillary Clinton ’ s successor as Secretary of State , or to the similarly gut-wrenching nomination of former Senator Chuck Hagel to be Secretary of Defense .
because of the sheer volume of nominations , most have traditionally sailed through the Senate with so-called unanimous consent , a process by which nominations are placed on the day ’ s calendar and the calendar is approved in a single voice vote . but that expedited process is becoming rarer nowadays .
a senator may place a “ hold ” on a nomination for any reason – including personal animus toward the nominee , or , more often , to gain something in exchange . and , increasingly , nominations have become a kind of public circus , attracting all kinds of players to the ring : non-governmental organizations , pundits , local politicians , and virtually anyone with an opinion and a way to express it .
these types of spectacles used to be reserved for the nomination of Supreme Court justices – a lifetime appointment to a nine-member body that can overturn laws passed by Congress and signed by the president . but those full-throttle battles have now spilled over to other nominations .
each time , the vetting essentially started from scratch . in addition to the countless forms , lengthy questionnaires , and background investigations , there was an interview with a paralegal whose job was to ferret out any information that might conceivably bear on the nomination .
these interviews included such cheerfully delivered questions as , “ Have you ever been arrested for growing marijuana ? ” Or , more directly : “ Do you take drugs ? ” &amp; # 160 ; Or , probing further into past activities or behavior , “ Have you ever been arrested for public drunkenness ? ”
in the past , a nomination was officially announced before the nominee moved on to the next phase and met with senators to discuss the appointment . now , as the process has become more fraught , the Obama administration has introduced a still further preliminary stage in which the nominee engages in a sort of do-it-yourself consultation with senators , after which the administration gauges the reaction and decides whether or not to go through with the nomination .
in the case of Susan Rice , the answer was no . in the case of Hagel , the administration decided to proceed .
in the latter case , the nominee , already beginning to wonder whether the job is worth the aggravation , meets with the senator to clear up “ misunderstandings . ” Unfortunately , there may not be any misunderstanding ; the senator is simply angry at the administration about something , or dislikes the nominee for something supposedly said or done previously .
allies of the nominee are recruited and pressed into service . doubting senators can be subjected to telephone campaigns by the nominee ’ s supporters ( often to counter similar campaigns from the nominee ’ s opponents ) , and even to threats from Senate leaders .
sometimes , opponents of a nominee merely want to make a point , or to cultivate donors ( an activity that can seep into any issue in Washington ) . when the point is made – or the fundraising goals are achieved – the nominee gets the happy phone call : “ It ’ s done .
the Usual Suspect
Berkeley – Across the Euro-Atlantic world , recovery from the recession of 2008-2009 remains sluggish and halting , turning what was readily curable cyclical unemployment into structural unemployment . and what was a brief hiccup in the process of capital accumulation has turned into a prolonged investment shortfall , which means a lower capital stock and a lower level of real GDP not just today , while the recovery is incomplete , but possibly for decades .
one legacy of Western Europe ’ s experience in the 1980 ’ s is a rule of thumb : each year that lower labor-force attachment and reduced capital stock as a result of declining investment depresses production $ 100 billion below normal implies that productive potential at full employment in future years will be $ 10 billion below what would otherwise have been forecast .
suppose that the United States or the Western European core economies boost their government purchases for next year by $ 100 billion . suppose further that their central banks , while unwilling to extend themselves further in unconventional monetary policy , are also unwilling to stymie elected governments ’ policies by offsetting their efforts to stimulate their economies .
what is the real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rate that the US or Western European core economies will have to pay on that extra $ 50 billion of debt ? if it is 1 % , boosting demand and production by $ 150 billion next year means that $ 500 million must be raised each year in the future to keep the debt from growing in real terms .
assuming that continued subnormal output casts a 10 % shadow on future potential output levels , that extra $ 150 billion of production means that in the future , when the economy has recovered , there will be an extra $ 15 billion of output – &amp; nbsp ; and an extra $ 5 billion of tax revenue . governments will not have to raise taxes to finance extra debt taken on to fund fiscal boosts .
normally , the multipliers applied to expansions in government purchases are much less than 1.5 , because the central bank does not maintain constant monetary conditions as government spending expands , but rather acts to keep the economy on track to meet the monetary authority ’ s inflation target . a more usual multiplier is the monetary-policy offset multiplier of 0.5 or zero .
moreover , in a normal situation , governments – even the US government and those in Western Europe – cannot run up the national debt and still pay a real interest rate of 1 % , or even 3 % . normally , the math of increasing government purchases tells us that a small or dubious boost to output today brings a heavier financing burden in the future , which makes debt-financed fiscal expansion a bad idea .
today the global economy is , as Ricardo Cabellero of MIT stresses , still desperately short of safe assets . investors worldwide are willing to pay extraordinarily high prices for , and accept extraordinarily low interest rates on , core-economy debt , for they value as an extraordinary benefit having a safe asset that they can use as collateral .
the Value of a Pale Blue Dot
Melbourne – The eighteenth-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote : “ Two things fill the heart with ever renewed and increasing awe and reverence , the more often and more steadily we meditate upon them : the starry firmament above and the moral law within . ”
what does astronomy tell us about “ the starry firmament above ” ?
in his essay “ Dreams and Facts , ” the philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote that our entire Milky Way galaxy is a tiny fragment of the universe , and within this fragment our solar system is “ an infinitesimal speck , ” and within this speck “ our planet is a microscopic dot . ”
it did so , in 1990 , and Earth shows up in a grainy image as a pale blue dot . if you go to YouTube and search for “ Carl Sagan – Pale Blue Dot , ” you can see it , and hear Sagan himself telling us that we must cherish our world because everything humans have ever valued exists only on that pale blue dot .
that is a moving experience , but what should we learn from it ?
Russell sometimes wrote as if the fact that we are a mere speck in a vast universe showed that we don ’ t really matter all that much : “ On this dot , tiny lumps of impure carbon and water , of complicated structure , with somewhat unusual physical and chemical properties , crawl about for a few years , until they are dissolved again into the elements of which they are compounded . ”
after World War II , when the world was divided into nuclear-armed camps threatening each other with mutual destruction , Russell did not take the view that our insignificance , when considered against the vastness of the universe , meant that the end of life on Earth did not matter . on the contrary , he made nuclear disarmament the chief focus of his political activity for the remainder of his life .
that ’ s probably true , even though scientists are now discovering other planets outside our solar system . perhaps one day we will find that we are not the only intelligent beings in the universe , and perhaps we will be able to discuss issues of interspecies ethics with such beings .
this brings us back to Kant ’ s other object of reverence and awe , the moral law within . what would beings with a completely different evolutionary origin from us – perhaps not even carbon-based life forms – think of our moral law ?
the Value of Being Undervalued
the paramount policy dilemma that emerging markets face nowadays is this : on the one hand , sustained economic growth requires a competitive ( read “ undervalued ” ) currency . on the other hand , any good news is immediately followed by currency appreciation , making the task of remaining competitive that much harder .
but the currency appreciation that follows will likely set off an unsustainable consumption boom , wreak havoc with your export sector , create unemployment , and sap your growth potential . success brings its reward in the form of immediate punishment !
in response , central banks may intervene in currency markets to prevent appreciation , at the cost of accumulating low-yield foreign reserves and diverting themselves from their primary goal of price stability . this is the strategy followed by countries such as China and Argentina .
or the central bank lets the markets go where they will , at the cost of drawing the ire of business , labor , the rest of the government , and , in fact , practically everyone except financial types . this is the strategy pursued by countries such as Turkey and South Africa , which have adopted more conventional “ inflation targeting ” regimes .
the first strategy is problematic because it is unsustainable . the second is undesirable because it buys stability at the cost of growth .
virtually every instance of sustained high growth has been accompanied by a significantly depreciated real exchange rate . this is as true of South Korea and Taiwan in the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s , as it is of Argentina today .
these are just some of the better-known examples . looking at the experience of more than 100 countries , I have found in my research that each 10 % undervaluation adds 0.3 percentage points to growth .
currency undervaluation is such a potent instrument for growth for the simple reason that it creates incentives for the economy ’ s growth-promoting sectors . it increases the profitability of manufacturing and non-traditional agricultural sectors , which are the activities with both the highest level of labor productivity and with the most rapid rates of productivity increase .
an undervalued currency enables an economy to integrate into the world economy on the basis of strong export performance . it stimulates production ( and hence employment ) , unlike overvaluation , which stimulates consumption .
while the central bank bears a good part of the responsibility , it needs support from other parts of the government , most notably from the finance ministry . maintaining a competitive currency requires a rise in domestic saving relative to investment , or a reduction in national expenditure relative to income .
this may not be popular , especially in an economic downturn . but no one has the right to complain about the central bank ’ s “ high-interest rate , appreciated currency ” policy when fiscal policy remains too lax for interest rates to be reduced without risking price stability .
government policies can target private saving directly , by creating incentives for saving through appropriate tax and pension policies . even more importantly , policies can discourage foreign-borrowing-led consumption booms by taxing capital inflows ( Chilean-style ) or increasing financial intermediaries ’ liquidity requirements .
with such policies in place , the comfort zone for central banks is enlarged sufficiently to loosen monetary policy . equally important , the central bank needs to signal to the public that it now cares about the real exchange rate , because it is important to exports , jobs , and sustainable growth .
there is huge room to maneuver between the extremes of targeting a specific level of the real exchange rate and disowning any interest in the real exchange rate . the central bank does need to have a view , updated over time , about the exchange rate ’ s appropriate range , and it should signal when it thinks the currency is moving in the wrong direction .
once the monetary rules of the game incorporate the real exchange rate , and assuming that fiscal policy remains supportive , investors can look forward to a less volatile and more competitive currency . this will mean more investment in tradable industries , more employment overall , and faster growth .
you will know you have succeeded when the United States ’ Treasury Secretary comes knocking on your door saying that you are guilty of manipulating your currency .
race-based Medicine ?
PALO ALTO – Race can undoubtedly be a tricky subject , with any suggestion of genetic differences among racial groups – beyond superficial characteristics like skin color – potentially invoking memories of the nineteenth-century eugenics movement and its eventual role in Nazi ideology . now , with drug companies increasingly seeking to develop medications that target particular racial groups , the long-taboo subject of racial genetics has reemerged .
much of the current debate centers on whether race should be a criterion for inclusion in clinical trials – and , by extension , whether drug labeling should mention race specifically . although the issues are complicated , the solution is simple : follow the data .
for example , scientists have known for decades that certain drugs can cause severe and precipitous anemia in people with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme G6PD . more recently , researchers have learned that certain cancer drugs are ineffective in fighting tumors containing the mutated variant of the gene KRAS .
such discoveries have enhanced researchers ’ ability to enrich study populations with patients who are likely to benefit from the drug , while sparing from any possible side effects of exposure those patients who are unlikely to benefit . enrichment thus enables researchers to strengthen clinical trials ’ “ statistical power , ” that is , the probability of detecting differences , if any exist , between study groups .
in the 1980 ’ s , a biomarker contributed to the success of the small but seminal clinical trial of human growth hormone in children who were unable to produce it naturally . some children lose the ability to make growth hormone due to injury or tumors ; others lack normal growth-hormone activity from birth , owing to a genetic mutation ; and others are missing the gene that codes for the hormone altogether .
giving the latter group exogenous growth hormone is futile , because their immune systems react to the “ foreign ” protein by producing antibodies . although the hormone may stimulate growth for a short period , the antibodies soon bind and neutralize it .
by limiting the study population to children in the other two groups , for whom exogenous growth hormone stimulates normal growth , researchers achieved a 100 % relative treatment difference . in other words , every subject who received the active drug responded , and none of those who received the placebo did .
clearly , genetic markers are useful in designing clinical trials . but are more subjective factors like race or ethnicity also relevant ?
in 1996 , inconclusive clinical trials led US regulators to reject the drug . but when more detailed analysis of the data revealed potentially elevated benefits for black patients , a new trial was performed on 1,050 self-identified “ black ” patients with severe heart failure for whom available treatments had proved ineffective .
the results – a 43 % reduction in mortality and a 39 % decrease in hospital visits among patients who received BiDil – were so striking that the study was concluded early . although BiDil has not been a great commercial success since its approval in 2009 , it remains on the market .
some regard race-based medical treatment as necessary to reduce health disparities , while others view it as downright discriminatory . when BiDil was approved , Francis Collins , who was Director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute at the time , warned that “ we should move without delay from blurry and potentially misleading surrogates for drug response , such as race , to the more specific causes . ”
of course , Collins was correct ; race is a crude and incomplete mechanism for understanding genetic differences . but we must fight illness with the data we have , not the data we wish we had .
the Vanished Intellectual
this spring marks the centenary of the birth of two all-round intellectuals , those ideological avatars of the Cold War era , Raymond Aron and Jean-Paul Sartre . Aron was born on March 14 , 1905 , Sartre on June 21 .
Sartre and Aron began their 50-year acquaintance with a shared elite French education that included a formative period in Germany just before the rise of Nazism . each in his inimitable way displayed the contrariness both loved and loathed in intellectuals : Aron fancied Anglo-American liberalism before it became fashionable , while Sartre remained a Communist sympathiser after the fashion had passed .
yet they often stood together against the French political establishment . both joined the Resistance when France was a Nazi puppet state , and both called for Algerian independence after France regained its sovereignty .
unfortunately , Sartre and Aron are also joined in death : both have been disowned , ignored , or underrated by all the academic disciplines – philosophy , literature , sociology , politics – to which their voluminous works might be thought to have contributed . silenced by death , Sartre and Aron are remembered more for the attitudes they brought to whatever they wrote about than for what they actually said .
great intellectuals like Abelard , Erasmus , Galileo , Voltaire , Zola , and Russell each challenged the pieties of his era , and we now regard their success as a good thing . but most of us are likely to recoil at the methods they used in their work as intellectuals : caricature , deception , and even fabrication .
Abelard is credited with the introduction of theology as a critical discipline in Christianity . yet , he did so by juxtaposing contradictory quotes taken out of context , showing that neither the Bible nor the Church fathers speak in one voice and that readers must decide for themselves .
similarly , Galileo is now known to have committed what we now call “ research fraud ” in his famed physical experiments . assuming he conducted them at all , they very probably did not produce the neat results that he used to assail his opponents .
as for Zola , who defended Captain Alfred Dreyfus from charges of treason fueled by anti-Semitism , he was easily convicted for libel because he merely questioned the motives of witnesses without offering any new evidence .
all three were subsequently vindicated – sometimes in their lifetimes , sometimes not . what they shared is a paradoxical ethic common to all intellectuals : the end cause of truth justifies whatever means happens to be at your disposal .
to an intellectual , an academic may look like someone who mistakes the means of inquiry for its end . but to academics , intellectuals look like ramblers freely trespassing on other people ’ s property , picking the fruits and despoiling the soil .
intellectuals differ from ordinary academics in holding that the truth is best approached not by producing new knowledge , but by destroying old belief . when the Enlightenment philosophers renovated the old Christian slogan , “ The truth shall set you free , ” they imagined a process of opening doors , not building barricades .
in short , intellectuals want their audiences to think for themselves , not simply shift allegiances from one expert to another . the intellectual ’ s ethic is both exhilarating and harsh , for it places responsibility for thinking squarely on the thinker ’ s shoulders .
what is much less obvious is that such empowerment requires the destruction of socially sanctioned knowledge . only then is a society ’ s space for decision opened up , enabling its members to move in many more directions than previously deemed possible .
Aron preferred demonizing fellow intellectuals as alarmists than conceding that the Cold War might eventuate in a nuclear holocaust . Sartre castigated those who failed to resist oppression when they could have , while excusing those who enforced oppression given the chance .
Aron exaggerated the power of reason , while Sartre inflated the power of action . each wanted to take French society in radically different directions , but both never ceased being critical of the status quo .
the Varieties of Unemployment
Berkeley – We hear from surprisingly many quarters these days that governments in Europe and North America , and their central banks , should give up on the expansionary policies they have pursued to try to create jobs . the high unemployment currently afflicting the North Atlantic , critics of government stimulus maintain , is not cyclical but “ structural , ” and thus cannot be alleviated by policies that boost aggregate demand .
when people who in other circumstances could be happy , healthy , and productive members of the workforce lack the skills , confidence , social networks , and experience needed to find work worth paying for , we obviously have a problem . and if unemployment in Europe and North America stays elevated for two or three more years , it is highly likely that we will have to face it .
but is that true today ? does it look right now as if the biggest problem facing the economies of Europe and North America is structural unemployment ?
the economy is depressed and unemployment is high not because of slack aggregate demand generated by a collapse in spending , but instead because “ structural ” factors have produced a mismatch between the skills of the labor force and the distribution of demand . the structure of demand by consumers is different from the jobs that workers are capable of filling .
for example , suppose that you have many workers qualified and skilled to work in construction , but households have decided that their houses are more than large enough , and wish to fill them with manufactured goods . this would produce structural unemployment to the extent that the ex-construction workers could not do things in manufacturing that would make it worthwhile for manufacturing firms to hire them .
it might require significant time to retrain construction workers and plug them into social networks in which they become good manufacturing workers . we might see prolonged and high unemployment in the construction sector , and in regions that had seen the biggest previous construction booms .
but depression in the construction sector and unemployment among its ex-workers would be balanced by exuberance in the manufacturing sector , rising prices for manufactured goods , and long hours and high wages for manufacturing workers
this may well look like structural unemployment in three years . in three years , we may well see labor shortages , rising wages , and increasing prices in expanding sectors , accompanied by high unemployment elsewhere in the economy .
but that is not our problem now . sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
the Velvet Delusion
college STATION , TEXAS – With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the relatively non-violent overthrow of communism throughout Central and Eastern Europe , optimists predicted a new golden age of a world filled with peaceful democracies . history , for some , seemed to have come to an end .
they saw demonstrators in East European capitals and Chinese crowds in Tiananmen Square chanting for freedom , and believed that those throngs wanted to be American . as George H.W. Bush declared , “ We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on Earth : through free markets , free speech , free elections , and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state . ”
the Gulf War confirmed American military might and the age-old perils of appeasement . the Clinton era gave us active democracy-promotion as the principle tool of American foreign policy , which George W. Bush ’ s administration took to unprecedented extremes .
Cold War victory provided the answer for each . “ America ’ s resolve and American ideals so clearly articulated by Ronald Reagan , ” Clinton said , “ helped to bring the Wall down . ” The lesson was clear : “ we achieve our aims by defending our values and leading the forces of freedom . ”
despite his frequent avowals of change , his central articulation of American policy seems remarkably static . “ Earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks , ” Obama preached in his famous campaign speech in Berlin , “ but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions . ”
this is why Obama ’ s America spends more on weaponry than the rest of the world combined , and why democracy-promotion remains the unquestioned foundation of American foreign policy , with debate possible only about its application . history offers a recipe for success , so long as Americans adhere to the lesson of 1989 .
European strategists largely dismissed America ’ s interpretation that force had won the Cold War , believing that cooperation had triumphed precisely because force was absent . they heard in pleas for freedom from behind the Iron Curtain not a desire to become American , but to join the remarkably successful European experiment in collective security and prosperity that emerged after World War II .
when Mikhail Gorbachev spoke of a “ Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals , ” his conception was not of a continent under Soviet domination , as Josef Stalin once threatened . having demonstrated remarkable restraint in 1989 , Russian leaders expected to be embraced by the West .
for Russian leaders , 1989 ’ s lesson was clear : trusting the West was foolish at best , dangerous at worst . Gorbachev ’ s vision of European inclusion neglected centuries of Russian history ; the West did not want Russian participation .
they recoiled at the Soviet bloc ’ s disintegration . “ Every effort should be made to prevent changes in Eastern Europe from influencing China ’ s internal development , ” party officials concluded in March 1989 , and within months they violently crushed democratic protesters .
yet China ’ s leaders also recognized that they ignored popular demands at great peril . the government thus made an implicit deal with its citizens : political dissent would not be tolerated , but , in exchange , the state would guarantee economic growth .
Chinese foreign policy also prioritized legitimacy after 1989 , with the regime hoping to reassert its authority globally by expanding China ’ s participation in international organizations . Chinese leaders embraced the cooperative nature of the post-1945 European process , but simultaneously took the Russian lesson to heart : the West would not yield merely to good intentions .
in fact , Chinese leaders have spent remarkably little , relative to China ’ s growing GDP , on the military . Chinese power today comes not from its ability to match America ’ s blue-water navy , but from its holdings in US Treasury bonds .
the legacy of 1989 echoes even in Iran , whose leaders seem clearly to have learned from Tiananmen Square and the collapse of the Iron Curtain that a committed government can , indeed , demobilize a public demanding reform .
but it did – and with extraordinary speed . in looking back at 1989 , we are , in effect , looking forward from that year ’ s momentous events at the very different legacies that they produced .
the Virtual Enemy
five years have passed since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of September , 2001 , yet it seems that policymakers have learned little about how terrorist cells operate , and what their weaknesses are . the Bush administration still uses the phrase “ war on terror ” and behaves as though it really is a war , the ordinary kind where one government fights another .
the Madrid , London , and Bali attacks , as well as several thwarted operations in the United States and Britain , were all characterized by their dispersed organization . independently generated plots emerged and used ad hoc resources , often within the target country .
individuals can be involved for profit and power , or for political and religious reasons , while others participate for hate or thrills . moreover , there are vast differences in terms of risks , rewards , and imperatives as one moves up the organizational chain , or jumps from cell to cell .
terrorism is a violent version of an “ agile virtual enterprise . ” A virtual enterprise is any small group that self-assembles into an organization that is just large enough to accomplish the collective intention .
virtual enterprises are unusually innovative , and , in the business sector , they are possibly the only system that can build a one-off product well . a conspicuous example already exists in the movie production industry .
at present , most of the price of any product supports the huge , inefficient organization that assembled it . nearly all the creativity and problem solving occurs in small companies and is later “ integrated ” by mega-corporations , which have an expensive and vulnerable infrastructure , and keep most of the profit .
this model is the current basis of the business world , just as centralization has also been the favored defense strategy . when you buy a car from General Motors , 80 cents from each dollar goes to GM , which mostly only manages itself .
ironically , extensive research into alternative models was funded through the US Department of Defense , which , as the world ’ s largest buyer of complex machinery , wanted better , cheaper and more tailored goods . the research noted the conditions and triggers needed to facilitate the self-assembly of small opportunistic groups and enable them to act like large companies .
it is often forgotten that US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld emerged from a comfortable retirement to reorganize the American military into a smaller , more agile force , using some of these same insights . but the planning for the Iraq invasion , in which Rumsfeld advocated the use of fewer troops than advised , suggests a poor understanding of distributed systems .
scores of texts are appearing in the Muslim world on jihadi strategic studies . the best known in the West is The Management of Savagery , but only because it was translated and made public .
these books ( and the trends they indicate ) are becoming less dogmatic and increasingly sophisticated in the adoption of modern management techniques . their research surely includes the young science of virtual enterprise management : how to nurture and support self-organizing cells .
some kinds of trust can be based on an artificial notion of “ not us ” rather than on real values and direct experience . that is why the Bush administration ’ s actions actually strengthen the virtual terrorist enterprise dynamic .
it promises to decouple the management of finance from that of production , implying faster innovation and economic growth . however , if Western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how these structures operate , they stand no chance of combating the agile terrorist enterprise .
the Wages of Economic Ignorance
London – Politicians are masters at “ passing the buck . ” Everything good that happens reflects their exceptional talents and efforts ; everything bad is caused by someone or something else .
three years after the global economy ’ s near-collapse , the feeble recovery has already petered out in most developed countries , whose economic inertia will drag down the rest . pundits decry a “ double-dip ” recession , but in some countries the first dip never ended : Greek GDP has been dipping for three years .
the eurozone crisis did not derail recovery ; it is the result of a lack of recovery . it is the natural , predictable , and ( by many ) predicted result of the main European countries ’ deliberate policy of repressing aggregate demand .
that policy was destined to produce a financial crisis , because it was bound to leave governments and banks with depleted assets and larger debts . despite austerity , the forecast of this year ’ s UK structural deficit has increased from 6.5 % to 8 % – requiring an extra £ 22 billion ( $ 34.6 billion ) in cuts a year .
depressions , recessions , contractions – call them what you will – occur because the private-sector spends less than it did previously . this means that its income falls , because spending by one firm or household is income for another .
in this situation , government deficits rise naturally , as tax revenues decline and spending on unemployment insurance and other benefits rises . these “ automatic stabilizers ” plug part of the private-sector spending gap .
but if the government starts reducing its own deficit before private-sector spending recovers , the net result will be a further decline in total spending , and hence in total income , causing the government ’ s deficit to widen , rather than narrow . true , if governments stop spending altogether , deficits will eventually fall to zero .
our leaders may be intellectually challenged , but they are not suicidal . deficit reduction eventually will be put into cold storage , either openly , as I would prefer , or surreptitiously , as is politicians ’ way .
those who see the need for such a growth strategy , but who also want to help their friends , like the idea of tax cuts – especially for the rich . this knocks a hole in current deficit-reduction plans , but , provided government continues to cut spending , it has the benefit ( from a conservative ’ s point of view ) of shrinking the state ’ s role over time .
apart from questions of fairness , cutting top tax rates is an inferior way to increase spending , because the rich have a higher propensity to save . tax reductions should be targeted specifically at the poor if one wants the money to be spent to stimulate the economy .
governments can do this consistently with a medium-term deficit-reduction plan by making a crucial distinction between their budgets ’ current and capital accounts . the current account covers spending on services and perishable goods that produce no assets .
if today ’ s accounting rules are too insensitive to make this distinction , a separate entity could do the investing . a national investment bank would be capitalized by the government , borrow from the private sector , and invest in infrastructure , housing , and “ greening ” the economy .
if nothing works , it will be time to sprinkle the country with what Milton Friedman called “ helicopter money ” – that is , put purchasing power directly into people ’ s pockets , by giving every household a spending voucher with an expiration date . this would at least keep the economy afloat pending the development of the longer-term investment program .
it would be better if such schemes could be agreed upon by all by G-20 countries , as was briefly the case in the coordinated stimulus of April 2009 . if not , groups of countries should pursue them on their own .
its current bailout schemes only help countries like Greece and Italy to borrow money cheaply in the face of prohibitively high market interest rates , while the schemes ’ insistence on more budget-deficit reduction in these countries will reduce European purchasing power further . the recipient governments will have to cut their spending ; the banks will have to take large losses .
it should be reconstituted with far fewer members , including only countries that do not run persistent current-account deficits . everything else that has been proposed to save the eurozone in its current form – a central treasury , a monetary authority that does more than target inflation , fiscal harmonization , a new treaty – is a political pipe dream .
the War Against Iraqi Women
Baghdad – Iraqi women ’ s organizations and international observers point to an escalating war against women in Iraq , aided by the widespread chaos and lawlessness under the US occupation . in addition to violence by US troops inside and outside of prisons , women in Iraq face daily violence from militants under the guise of religion and “ liberation . ”
with US forces in Iraq now funding both Sunni and Shia tribal leaders in an effort to stabilize the country , conditions for women grow deadlier by the day . Islamist leaders have imposed new restrictions on women , including prohibitions on work , bans on travel without a muhram ( male guardian ) , and compulsory veiling .
according to the Organization of Women ’ s Freedom in Iraq ( OWFI ) , formed in Baghdad in 2003 , women are harassed if they appear in the streets of most Iraqi cities and towns , educational institutions , or work places . now there are even “ no woman zones ” in some southern cities controlled by Islamist parties and tribal leaders .
in fact , the practice targets holders of PhD ’ s , professionals , political activists , and office workers . “ Politically active women , those who did not follow a strict dress code , and women human rights defenders were increasingly at risk of abuse , including by armed groups and religious extremists , ” Amnesty International said in its 2007 report .
indeed , a top police official in Basra reported that as many as 15 women are killed every month in the city . Ambulance drivers in Basra , paid to “ clean the streets ” before people go to work , pick up many more bodies of women every morning .
ironically , the forces leading this assault on women had little or no power under Saddam Hussein . but , following the US-led invasion in 2003 , southern Iraq was opened to forces known as Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice ( PVPV ) – militant gangs and individuals committed to archaic Islamic rule and suppression of women ’ s rights .
some members of these groups now serve in government , others in militias or as self-appointed vigilantes or hired guns . the goal of the PVPV is to confine women to the domestic realm and end all female participation in public and political life .
so must the US . under the Fourth Geneva Convention , the responsibility for protecting civilian populations in an occupied country belongs to the occupying forces , which , in this case , are clearly failing to protect Iraqi women .
first , the Iraqi government must immediately establish “ Protection of Women ” security patrols in Iraq ’ s southern cities . these patrols must receive gender-sensitive training and prioritize women ’ s security over tribal or fundamentalist religious values .
second , pursuant to its obligations under the Geneva Convention , the US must immediately take steps to protect the lives and freedoms of Iraqi civilians . unless the US does so , it must withdraw from Iraq , because the occupation would merely continue to sustain a breeding ground for violence against women .
the timetable for action is not subject to debate . it must begin today .
the War Against Iraq ’ s Children
Iraq ’ s children have suffered more than just successive wars and economic sanctions . the loss of parents and family resources has boosted child labor , homelessness , and inclinations towards violence and rebellion .
the increase in child labor reflects families ’ dire economic situation : children are frequently a family ’ s only breadwinners , and they work cheap . contractors in municipal services , for example , prefer to use children in order to cut costs .
other children load and transport items in the markets , where they must pull carts weighing 60-70 kilograms and carry boxes weighing 15 kilograms in temperatures of 50 degrees centigrade . two children may unload a truck carrying 1,000 kilograms of food items .
children who work in the garbage dumps are prone to skin and respiratory problems , while those who work with paints eventually become addicted to the intoxicants that they inhale . and all working children are vulnerable to malnutrition , as their diet typically lacks the items necessary to build body tissues .
nor is there any official authority to protect children and defend their rights in case of incapacitation or sickness . on the contrary , children are often beaten by family members if they do not provide the daily wage expected of them , or by their bosses when they are inattentive or make a mistake .
indeed , Iraqi children are exposed to beating without regard for their age and for myriad reasons , thus growing up insecure , hostile , and violent . moreover , they are prone to being kidnapped by criminal gangs , trained to steal or pickpocket , or , worse , placed at the mercy of terrorists for use in attacks .
the deterioration of families ’ financial situation has also left poor children deprived of educational opportunity . for many children , even when they do attend school , the collapse of infrastructure , the unavailability of electricity and water , and high temperatures in the summer are hardly conducive to successful study .
the small number of schools , the poor condition of buildings , and the collapse of relationships between students and teachers is also at fault . older children sit in classrooms with much younger children , growing frustrated and violent , rather than becoming role models for others to emulate .
when a family ’ s income is insufficient to pay school fees for every child , girls are typically denied an education , owing to the traditional belief that marriage is a girl ’ s final destiny . they must perform household chores and are subject to beating if they do not carry out orders issued by male family members .
at the other end of the spectrum , rape , adultery , early child bearing , and abortion have become ordinary matters . increasingly , Iraqi girls interpret anything given to them as a means to have sex with them .
orphans , whose number has increased sharply over the past quarter-century as a result of wars , economic sanctions , and terrorism , are especially vulnerable to the cruelest type of physical and psychological violence . having lost their homes and parents , they sleep in alleys , sell cigarettes or newspapers , and beg .
simply put , children in Iraq have been reduced from human beings worthy of care to tools of production and instruments of violence . we are quite literally breeding a new generation of disorder .
the War on “ Democratization ”
the wars in Lebanon and Gaza constitute a grave threat to democratic reform in the southern Mediterranean . these wars are inflicting heavy punishment on precisely those peoples who have held fully free and fair elections in the region , while eroding the legitimacy of Israel ’ s democracy .
at the time of its “ Cedar Revolution ” last year , Lebanon was held up as the best example so far of democratization in the Arab world . the enthusiasm with which the international community welcomed those changes now seems all but forgotten , which is also true of recent elections in Palestine – another longstanding international demand .
the signal being sent is clear : it is preferable that Israel , the only state in the region that abides by the rule of law , be surrounded by authoritarian regimes where political outcomes are predictable than by democratic states where Islamists may well rise to power . it happened in Palestine , and it could well happen in Egypt if free and fair free elections were held .
but it should now be clear to everyone that democratization in the southern Mediterranean cannot bypass Islamist movements , and that the success of that process largely depends on the degree to which their full participation in the political arena is ensured .
repressing political Islam , or attempting to “ erase ” Islamists militarily with total disregard for national political processes ( not to mention human life ) , is not the answer , because it won ’ t persuade electorates to turn away from Islamist movements . the efforts of reformist governments in the region to integrate such movements into the public sphere have been dealt a severe blow .
democracies have long known that extreme and indiscriminate punishment – which by definition affects friend and foe , combatant and civilian alike – is a grave violation of international law , as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , Louise Arbour , has pointed out . they also know that such action fuels radicalism , leading to the kind of tragic consequences that are all too familiar nowadays .
Hezbollah is , after all , a creature of Lebanon ’ s resistance to Israel ’ s 1982 invasion , now trying to reassert its influence at home and in the wider region by portraying itself as a champion of the Arab-Islamic cause , namely in Palestine . any reinforcement of its power will necessarily weaken Lebanon and the region ’ s democratic forces .
the prolonged absence of the United States from truly active engagement in the Middle East peace process is partly to blame for the current situation . for almost six years , there has been no significant US diplomatic initiative to resolve the Palestinian question or to pursue the Syrian track ( Israel still occupies the Golan Heights ) .
moreover , just when we were beginning to think that the Iraqi tragedy had made the limits of unilateralism and preemptive military strategies clear to all , the Bush administration encourages Israel ’ s military action – this time against a country that has painfully been attempting to consolidate democratic reform and to reafirm its sovereignty in relation to Syria .
Bush ’ s most promising initiative , promoting democracy across the Middle East , was already dealt a crippling blow by US intervention in Iraq and the ensuing civil war there . now the project is buried under the weight of America ’ s inability to protect Lebanon ’ s fragile democracy and Palestine ’ s democratic experiment .
a common European front could persuade the US to give Lebanon and Palestine enough time to consolidate their national democratic processes , thus isolating the radical elements of Hamas and steering Hezbollah to dissolution of its private army . with the US project in ruins , a credible European policy to delegitimize war and support democratization in its neighborhood has become essential .
the Water Hegemon
new DELHI – International discussion about China ’ s rise has focused on its increasing trade muscle , growing maritime ambitions , and expanding capacity to project military power . one critical issue , however , usually escapes attention : China ’ s rise as a hydro-hegemon with no modern historical parallel .
no other country has ever managed to assume such unchallenged riparian preeminence on a continent by controlling the headwaters of multiple international rivers and manipulating their cross-border flows . China , the world ’ s biggest dam builder – with slightly more than half of the approximately 50,000 large dams on the planet – is rapidly accumulating leverage against its neighbors by undertaking massive hydro-engineering projects on transnational rivers .
most of Asia ’ s important international rivers originate in territories that were forcibly annexed to the People ’ s Republic of China . the Tibetan Plateau , for example , is the world ’ s largest freshwater repository and the source of Asia ’ s greatest rivers , including those that are the lifeblood for mainland China and South and Southeast Asia .
this makes China the source of cross-border water flows to the largest number of countries in the world . yet China rejects the very notion of water sharing or institutionalized cooperation with downriver countries .
whereas riparian neighbors in Southeast and South Asia are bound by water pacts that they have negotiated between themselves , China does not have a single water treaty with any co-riparian country . indeed , having its cake and eating it , China is a dialogue partner but not a member of the Mekong River Commission , underscoring its intent not to abide by the Mekong basin community ’ s rules or take on any legal obligations .
worse , while promoting multilateralism on the world stage , China has given the cold shoulder to multilateral cooperation among river-basin states . the lower-Mekong countries , for example , view China ’ s strategy as an attempt to “ divide and conquer . ”
although China publicly favors bilateral initiatives over multilateral institutions in addressing water issues , it has not shown any real enthusiasm for meaningful bilateral action . as a result , water has increasingly become a new political divide in the country ’ s relations with neighbors like India , Russia , Kazakhstan , and Nepal .
China deflects attention from its refusal to share water , or to enter into institutionalized cooperation to manage common rivers sustainably , by flaunting the accords that it has signed on sharing flow statistics with riparian neighbors . these are not agreements to cooperate on shared resources , but rather commercial accords to sell hydrological data that other upstream countries provide free to downriver states .
with its industry now dominating the global hydropower-equipment market , China has also emerged as the largest dam builder overseas . from Pakistani-held Kashmir to Burma ’ s troubled Kachin and Shan states , China has widened its dam building to disputed or insurgency-torn areas , despite local backlashes .
for example , units of the People ’ s Liberation Army are engaged in dam and other strategic projects in the restive , Shia-majority region of Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-held Kashmir . and China ’ s dam building inside Burma to generate power for export to Chinese provinces has contributed to renewed bloody fighting recently , ending a 17-year ceasefire between the Kachin Independence Army and the government .
as with its territorial and maritime disputes with India , Vietnam , Japan , and others , China is seeking to disrupt the status quo on international-river flows . persuading it to halt further unilateral appropriation of shared waters has thus become pivotal to Asian peace and stability .
the Way Forward for Global Financial Policy
yet , as the world ’ s leading finance ministers and central bankers convene in Washington this month for the semi-annual International Monetary Fund board meetings , policy paralysis continues . there is simply no agreement on how to address glaring problems such as America ’ s increasingly fragile trade deficit , or financial dysfunction in a number of emerging markets .
US Treasury secretaries have always loved to lecture their foreign colleagues on America ’ s economic perfection , and why every country should seek to emulate it . never mind that this logic is now in danger of unraveling along with the US housing market ;
nevertheless , Europeans generally agree that their societies produce the best lifestyles , even if their economies are less efficient than America ’ s in a Darwinian sense . thus , European finance ministers , too , will not be keen to admit any need for major policy changes to deal with risks from financial globalization .
as huge winners from globalization , they want to avoid criticism of their trade and financial policies , which arguably remain considerably more protectionist than those of their rich-country counterparts . and they certainly don ’ t want to be pressed to apologize for holding hostage over $ 800 billion in foreign currency reserves , acquired to resist yen appreciation .
developing countries are also at fault . too many policymakers still believe that externally imposed opening to international capital flows was the main culprit behind the financial crises of the 1990 ’ s – a view that unfortunately is lent some intellectual respectability by a small number of left-leaning academics .
never mind that most of the crises could have been avoided , or late least substantially mitigated , if governments had let their currencies float against the dollar , rather than adopting rigid exchange-rate pegs . instead , the bogeyman of financial globalization is used as an excuse for continuing to coddle inefficient and monopolistic domestic financial systems .
last but not least , the IMF , as the multilateral agency charged with maintaining global financial stability , ought to be providing more leadership . indeed , it is probably the only player with the universal political and intellectual legitimacy to find a way forward on collective action to address financial globalization .
unfortunately , the IMF is paralyzed by the need to confront some internal governance problems , the biggest of which is the lack of a sensible way to recalculate the voting shares of countries as their relative influence in the global economy evolves . in particular , a radical increase in the weight of Asia ’ s vote is urgently needed .
first , there is the long-standing litany of policy responses needed to deal with the global trade imbalances . these include greater fiscal discipline in the US , greater reliance on domestic demand in both Europe and Asia , and more flexible exchange rates in Asia .
but it is time to go further and begin to lobby aggressively for faster financial liberalization in the developing world . true , most studies suggest that developing countries ought to precede any sharp opening to international financial markets by liberalizing trade .
ironically , bad memories of the IMF ’ s first , premature attempt to promote long-term capital market liberalization remain an obstacle today . the IMF ’ s attempt to enshrine capital market liberalization in its charter , coming as it did in the middle of the 1990 ’ s Asian financial crisis , was a public relations disaster .
but the core of the idea was right then , and it is right now . in the absence of better mechanisms for capital allocation , global growth in this century will slow down a lot sooner than it should .
the Way Out of Iraq
at last the point has been reached in Iraq where everyone ostensibly wants the same thing : the departure of Coalition forces from the country . the recent leak from Britain ’ s Ministry of Defense of a discussion paper on troop withdrawal highlights this desire .
but if they leave , it will also escalate , only faster . so the real question is how to get to the point where Iraq has a police force and army that can be trusted to maintain law as well as order .
notwithstanding the courage of the many Iraqis who join either the army or the police , no one should be surprised if some have motives that are less than pure . in northern Iraq , old scores are being settled and de facto ethnic segregation is being introduced in areas , such as Irbil , that were traditionally diverse .
so how can Iraq create uniformed services that can be trusted to enforce the law effectively and impartially , without consideration of ethnicity , religion and gender ? the traditional answer is to recruit , train , and instill the “ right values . ”
this might appear excessively hopeful , yet in Afghanistan , a country akin to Iraq in many ways , there are groups working towards this goal . the Cooperation for Peace and Unity ( CPAU ) provides a model of how this can be done .
the initiative faces a culture in which violence is so deeply embedded that children once learned arithmetic by counting numbers of dead Soviet soldiers . the Committees therefore seek to bring together all sections of the community – including teachers , tribal leaders , religious leaders , women , police , soldiers , judges , and businesspeople – to develop ways of resolving conflicts non-violently .
although monitoring has not been a formal part of the role of the committees until now ( it is planned for the future ) , the mere fact that the police , army , and judiciary are part of these committees brings them into contact with the rest of the community , provides feedback , and starts to build trust .
in one workshop , the local military commander came for a couple of hours , as a courtesy , and ended up staying for the whole week . at the end , he apologized for his violent past and made a commitment to disarm his 2,000-strong private army .
in Iraq , projects such as the Humanitarian Liaison Center in Kirkuk are starting to fulfill a monitoring function by offering the ethnically diverse local population the opportunity to bring grievances and get help in having them resolved . but , too often , even if a court ruling is made , it is not enforced as a result of intimidation .
much good work on strengthening civil society has already been done by American and British forces . we don ’ t hear about the workshops for women ’ s empowerment , or the successful organization of small-scale local elections across the country .
but mobilizing civil society is hugely challenging , particularly when , as in Iraq , it needs to be done quickly and on a large scale . military force is still necessary , but so are incentives to disarm , including the prospect of economic opportunities that are more fruitful than crime and extortion .
the Humanitarian Liaison Center serves the whole of Kirkuk at an annual cost of just $ 75,000 a year . with $ 10 million , such centers could be replicated 100 times – with plenty of change left over .
the challenge is to commit to this approach , to scale up and to support to the hilt the brave people who take on the challenge of holding power to account . otherwise , the Iraqi people are unlikely to get the security that , after so many years of suffering , they so desperately need .
the Mismeasure of Poverty
Rome – In early 2012 , outgoing World Bank President Robert Zoellick announced that the Millennium Development Goal of halving the global poverty rate relative to its 1990 level had been achieved in 2010 – five years ahead of schedule . but many analysts have challenged estimates that rely on the World Bank ’ s current poverty line , raised in 2008 from $ 1 to $ 1.25 per day , in purchasing power parity ( PPP ) terms .
critics argue that , for methodological reasons , the PPP-based poverty line misrepresents the prevalence of poverty worldwide . for example , the three rounds of the World Bank ’ s International Comparison Program that have been conducted so far have each defined the poverty line differently , underscoring the weakness of the current measure .
improving global poverty estimates – the World Bank ’ s extend over three decades , beginning in 1981 – requires overcoming three major problems : insufficient survey data , flawed survey execution , and faulty PPP conversions . unfortunately , the World Bank ’ s approach has evaded these issues or addressed them inadequately .
the World Bank avoids this problem by assuming that the poverty rate of any country without such data matches the region ’ s average . but this approach has led to North Korea being assigned essentially the same poverty rate as China , even though the former regularly receives food aid from the latter .
likewise , World Bank survey data estimate that the Indian middle class comprises roughly 90 million people , despite more than 900 million cell-phone subscribers and 40 million cars . such contradictions reflect significant measurement discrepancies , which , in India ’ s case , could be on the order of hundreds of millions of people .
the third major challenge is using PPP estimates , measured in national currencies , to convert survey data into global poverty estimates that account for cost-of-living differences between countries . given that the conversions that the World Bank currently uses are based on an international exercise that was conducted for 2005 , they fail to account for recent factors that are significantly affecting the poor and vulnerable , such as much higher prices for staple foods .
furthermore , PPP conversions have little significance for some countries , most notably China . rather than permit price surveys in a random sample of locations ( required for accuracy ) , China restricted data collection to a few urban areas .
with such a flawed system shaping the world ’ s understanding of poverty , declarations of success or failure carry little meaning . an improved poverty indicator – one that addresses , rather than avoids , the three major problems plaguing global estimates – is urgently needed .
why No Glass-Steagall II ?
Manila – Eighty years ago this month , Ferdinand Pecora , the cigar-chomping former assistant district attorney for New York City , was appointed chief counsel for the US Senate Committee on Banking and Currency . in subsequent months , the hearings of the Pecora Commission featured many sensational revelations about the practices that led to the 1930 ’ s financial crisis .
with unit banking ( in which all operations are carried out in self-standing offices ) viewed as unstable , banks were now permitted to branch more widely . Glass-Steagall also strengthened regulators ’ ability to clamp down on lending for real-estate and stock-market speculation .
the hearings also led to passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . securities issuers and traders were required to release more information , and were subjected to higher transparency standards .
say what you will about the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 , but it is weak soup by the standards of the 1930 ’ s . in response to what is widely regarded as the most serious financial crisis in 80 years , it does much less to change the structure and regulation of the US financial system .
the American Bankers Association , worried about the fees that banks would be obliged to pay , vehemently opposed deposit insurance . the State Bankers Association , to which many unit banks belonged , condemned the provisions designed to facilitate state-wide branching .
nor is it obvious that the bankers suffered from more adverse publicity . the Pecora Commission hearings were sensational , but it is difficult to argue that the public anger they whipped up was much greater than that which greeted Wall Street ’ s titans when they testified before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2010 .
the bank ’ s chairman , Charles Mitchell , danced around the question of conflicts of interest between his bank ’ s deposit-taking and securities-underwriting activities . in any case , more attention was paid to the revelation that Mitchell had sold 18,000 bank shares to his wife at a loss to evade taxes .
Pecora turned next to the investment banks . this time , the revelation was that J.P. Morgan &amp; amp ;
Co. had provided special access to initial public offerings for prominent public figures , including a former treasury secretary and future Supreme Court justice . but , again , these disclosures did not speak to issues like the desirability of branching or deposit insurance .
another popular argument for the success of 1930 ’ s reform is that Congress had already agreed on a diagnosis of the problem and could build on its own earlier efforts to treat it . Senator Carter Glass had been pushing for years for more permissive branching laws and centralized supervision of banks .
similarly , more than 100 bills for federal deposit insurance had been proposed in the preceding 50 years . one , co-sponsored by Representative Henry Steagall , had been passed by the House .
glass , for his part , opposed deposit insurance . the final bill passed only when its sponsors agreed to combine deposit insurance with new banking regulation , creating a package with something for everyone .
underwriting had collapsed , and banks were more than ready to get out of the securities business . the Glass-Steagall separation of commercial and investment banking simply validated a transition that was already underway .
in 2009-2010 , by contrast , the big banks were still seeking to maintain their existing range of activities . this caused the industry to resist strongly efforts to rein in practices like proprietary trading .
after 2008 , by contrast , policymakers succeeded in preventing the worst , which ruled out the sense of urgency that surrounded the Pecora Commission hearings . the ultimate irony is that this very success led to less reform .
the Egyptian Struggle and Beyond
London – The events that led Egypt ’ s military to remove President Mohamed Morsi confronted the army with a simple choice : intervention or chaos . seventeen million people in the street is not the same thing as an election .
Morsi ’ s Muslim Brotherhood was unable to shift from being an opposition movement to being a governing party . of course , governments govern badly or well or averagely .
now the army is faced with the delicate and arduous task of steering the country back onto a path toward elections and a rapid return to democratic rule . we must hope that they can do this without further bloodshed .
what is happening in Egypt is the latest example of the interplay , visible the world over , between democracy , protest , and government efficacy .
they believed that with democracy , problems would be solved . when I asked what the right economic policy for Egypt should be , they simply said that all would be fine , because now they had democracy ; and any economic ideas that they did have were well to the old left of anything that had a remote chance of working .
they don ’ t want to wait for an election . in fact , as Turkey and Brazil show , people may protest even when , by any objective measure , their countries have made huge progress .
they want higher-quality services , better housing , and good infrastructure ( especially transport ) . and they resent – to the point of mobilizing in the streets – any hint that a clique at the top is barring their way .
this is a sort of free democratic spirit that operates outside the convention that elections decide the government . it is fueled enormously by social media ( itself a revolutionary phenomenon ) .
a protest is not a policy ; and a placard is not a program for government . but , if governments lack clear arguments with which to rebut protesters , they are in trouble .
in Egypt , the government ’ s problems were compounded by resentment of the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s ideology and intolerance . people came to believe that the Brotherhood was steadily imposing its own doctrines on everyday life .
across the Middle East , for the first time , there is open debate about the role of religion in politics . despite the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s superior organization , those who support an intrinsically secular approach to government – and this is true in most of the region – are probably in the majority .
Egypt is the latest reminder that the region is in turmoil and won ’ t leave us alone , however much we may wish it would . disengagement is not an option , because the status quo is not an option .
so it should engage with the new de facto power and help the new government make the changes necessary , especially with respect to the economy , so that it can deliver adequate performance for Egypt ’ s citizens . in that way , it can also help shape a path back to the ballot box that is designed by and for Egyptians . &amp; # 160 ;
the world cannot afford a nuclear-armed Iran . and I haven ’ t even mentioned the challenges of Libya , Yemen , or , further afield , Pakistan , or the plague of extremism now coursing through the northern part of Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Central Asia .
we have to make decisions for the long-term , because , in the short term , there are no simple solutions . US Secretary of State John Kerry ’ s current dedication and drive on the Israeli-Palestinian issue is exemplary : if it matters , act on it , however difficult .
it is difficult , time-consuming , and expensive . many in the West believe that it should be someone else ’ s job to help sort it out .
the good news is that there are millions of modern and open-minded people in the Middle East .
will Programmers Rule ?
new DELHI – Marc Andreessen made his first fortune writing the code that became Netscape Navigator , the Internet browser . he is now a venture capitalist who evangelizes about the growing importance of software in business today .
to stop the world from being divided between a few alpha programmers and many drones , he wants the potential drones to stop taking easy liberal arts courses in college . instead , he wants them to focus on courses in science , technology , engineering , and math ( STEM ) , where the good jobs will be .
first , software with a slight edge tends to get a significantly greater share of the available market ; and , second , the available market is global , because it costs so little to make an extra copy and send it anywhere in the world . as a result , those who are creative and competent enough to write that slightly better search engine will capture the global market .
in this winner-take-all environment , only a small number of those who have taken programming courses will reap a majority of the rents . completing the right preparatory courses is no guarantee of receiving a share of the software jackpot .
put differently , in a winner-take-all world , raising the average level of skills or education does nothing to alter the skewed distribution of income . so , will anything prevent inequality from widening ?
the obvious answer is yes . but how society responds will mean the difference between a prosperous world and a world torn apart by slow growth and resentment .
property rights are ultimately sanctioned by society , and , to the extent that they seem to be unfair , society has an incentive to change them . but will society see the software billionaire as having acquired her wealth unfairly , or will it see that wealth as a fair reward for cleverness ?
after all , they themselves have a chance to be winners . interestingly , software may itself reduce the cost of expanding educational access – witness the massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) offered by companies like Coursera .
one is that cultural norms may develop that encourage billionaires to share their wealth , even if they are spared taxation . for example , the Giving Pledge is a commitment by some of the world ’ s richest people , Warren Buffett and Bill Gates among them , to devote the majority of their wealth to philanthropy .
economic competition may also play a role – if billions are to be made by innovators , more of the most talented get into innovation , so that , even in a winner-take-all world , the winner captures the market for a fleeting moment before someone else takes it away from him . the billions to be made today may only be millions tomorrow .
while a quartz watch keeps time more accurately than the most finely crafted handmade mechanical Swiss watch , the value of a quartz watch has plummeted , while Swiss watches ’ value has climbed into the stratosphere . even though they are virtually indistinguishable in appearance , people seem to cherish the knowledge that someone has lovingly crafted their watch .
so it may well be that the demand for discussing , say , medieval French church music in small classes at a university will grow even as the demand for MOOCs grows . not everyone should heed Andreessen ’ s exhortation to quit liberal arts programs !
that is not to say that his basic concerns are unwarranted . better access for all to fundamental needs like quality education is necessary to make the winner-take-all character of markets more tolerable .
the Wobbly West
Charleston , SOUTH CAROLINA – Early in the financial crisis , a major emerging-market investor told me : “ This is not a global , but a semi-global financial crisis . ” He was right : it really was a crisis of the United States , Europe , and Japan .
the eurozone sovereign-debt crisis appears to have been the worst-managed financial crisis since Argentina ’ s default in 2001 . the European Union and eurozone leaders have seriously discredited themselves .
the International Monetary Fund has never bet such huge sums on a single country as it has on Greece . as a result , the IMF , a custodian of some of the international reserves held by the world ’ s central banks , risks losing tens of billions of dollars .
is this a responsible use of international taxpayers ’ money ? would the IMF not have insisted on a much tougher program , with less financing , for any country outside the eurozone ?
Europeans , moreover , dominate the Fund ’ s leadership . it is a discomforting conflict of interest that debtors dominate an international institution that lends them vast sums .
this mismanagement should disqualify any eurozone policymaker from the IMF ’ s managing directorship , and yet Christine Lagarde , French finance minister , was named to succeed her compatriot Dominique Strauss-Kahn after his resignation . who would seriously have suggested a Russian to lead the IMF after its financial crash in 1998 , or an Argentine after its default in 2001 ?
the EU , the United States , and Japan are in fiscal jeopardy , and several countries – Japan , Greece , Italy , and Belgium – have public debts exceeding their GDP . increasingly , people recognize that loose fiscal policy was poor economic policy , with serious implications for macroeconomic thinking , politics , and constitutions .
during the crisis , prevailing macroeconomic theory counseled massive fiscal stimulus , thereby aggravating the public-debt crisis . the question today is whether macroeconomic theory will render itself as irrelevant as the political economy of socialism , or make useful contributions to economic policy .
how could people and governments accept these enormous debts and even recommend further fiscal stimulus ? many public expenditures and budget deficits have no justification other than populism , and the big political loser of the crisis has been European social democracy , Keynesian economics ’ political counterpart .
all too often , social democracy has amounted to populism , opposing any cuts in public expenditures and even deregulation , which would have enhanced productivity . European voters are now punishing social-democratic parties , which have become weaker than at any time since World War I. Instead , a fiscally responsible center-right alignment of political forces has taken power in all but three of the 27 EU countries .
Western democracies have prided themselves on institutional checks and balances , but obviously these mechanisms did not work during the crisis or the preceding boom . and they have been a recipe for policy paralysis in America ’ s long debate about raising the ceiling on its national debt .
there is no denying that advanced democracies largely failed to preempt the financial and sovereign-debt crises , while most emerging economies pursued better economic policies . how can modern Western democracies impose strict fiscal discipline ?
now many of these guarantees will need to be thrown out . instead , a number of European countries are discussing the introduction of stringent fiscal rules into their constitutions , and are contemplating even more far-reaching changes .
some European countries can reduce their debt through continuous budget surpluses , as Bulgaria , Finland , Russia , and Sweden have done in the last decade . privatization of public corporations and property is another possibility .
my Petersen Institute colleague Carmen Reinhardt suspects that financial repression will be the main debt-reduction method : governments will rely on regulation and manipulation to force savers to pay down public debt through negative real returns on their bond investments .
meanwhile , central bankers everywhere ask themselves : why keep ever-larger international reserves in two of the world ’ s most mismanaged currencies , the US dollar and the euro ? however rare changes in reserve currencies have been historically , the current situation is no longer tenable ; but a switch could further destabilize the world economy .
at present , the US accounts for half of all global military expenditures , but cuts are due . relative US military power is not likely to be this great ever again , and China ’ s military rise looks as inevitable as its economic success .
even so , some economists still advocate more fiscal stimulus . instead , Western leaders need to focus on fixing their state budgets in order to salvage what they can .
the Importance of Doing Business
Madrid – This month , an independent review panel is expected to release its findings regarding the World Bank ’ s Doing Business report . speculation abounds that the panel might recommend outsourcing Doing Business , removing its rankings of countries for the ease of doing business in them , or even eliminating the report altogether .
this challenge is not a new one , as powerful World Bank shareholders have been trying to sink the project since its inception in 2002 . now China , the world ’ s second-largest economy and increasingly influential within the Bank , is seeking to water down the report by eliminating , among other things , its country rankings .
but gutting or cutting Doing Business would be a grave error and would essentially result in throwing a healthy baby out with the bathwater . its methodology is largely sound , its purposes are valid , and its findings are useful .
the 2013 report includes quantitative data grouped in 11 sets of indicators , ranging from the ease of starting a business to the availability of credit . the data are compared across economies and over time to rank 185 countries in ten categories of business regulation , such as “ Resolving Insolvency ” and “ Trading Across Borders . ”
doing Business is not intended to be a comprehensive review of each country ’ s economy . rather , it seeks to provide policymakers with benchmarks that can serve as a starting point for discussion of beneficial reforms .
doing Business has been a leader in synthesizing subjective and quantitative data to create understandable metrics . by limiting the total number of indicators studied and producing clear benchmarks , it helps policymakers to define their objectives and to improve the efficiency of regulation in crucial areas .
the project has been a rare World Bank success , recording almost 2,000 reforms over the past decade , and has proved to be a valuable tool for policymakers in developing economies to spur reform and enhance investment . Rwanda , for example , has skyrocketed in the rankings , from 143rd in 2009 to 52nd in 2013 .
similarly , as Georgia has climbed to ninth in the rankings , its GDP has risen by more than 200 % and foreign investment inflows have increased by nearly 300 % since 2003 . of all of the economies included in the report , only Zimbabwe and Venezuela have failed to maintain or improve their indicators since 2005 .
but such success stories have not deterred the project ’ s critics . early criticism came from France , which vigorously objected to the 2004 and 2006 editions ’ endorsement of the “ legal origins ” theory , which suggests that common-law countries benefit from greater regulatory efficiency than civil-law countries .
others criticize the report ’ s methodology , claiming that the indicators are not inclusive or that they improperly measure countries ’ regulatory environments . still others have argued that Doing Business contains built-in biases against regulation and taxation , which may create incentives for countries to enact reforms that game the system rather than produce meaningful results .
for example , following criticism of the “ Employing Workers ” indicator , the International Finance Corporation ( the World Bank ’ s private-sector lending arm ) conducted a review and removed it as a contributing factor to the rankings . a similar review should be carried out on other indicators , such as “ Paying Taxes , ” with any changes tailored to enable continued comparison across time , one of the project ’ s main benefits .
given that the project ’ s methodological flaws can be addressed with targeted review and reform , doing away with Doing Business altogether would be extreme and unnecessary . countries like France , China , and India , dissatisfied with their low rankings , should not be allowed to eliminate or cripple the project .
just last month , US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew trumpeted Doing Business in congressional testimony justifying American support for multilateral development banks . more broadly , backing away from such a project would undermine the Bank ’ s promotion of rule-based systems and legal certainty – and would weaken the reformers in developing and emerging economies who seek to transform clientilist and patronage-based economies .
if the project is eliminated , European policymakers will be denied important information that could help to guide discussions about enhancing competitiveness . for example , registering property in Greece is more difficult than in Djibouti ; enforcing a contract in Italy takes roughly three times as long as it does in Vietnam ; and starting a business in Spain takes roughly 3.5 times longer than in Azerbaijan .
doing Business does not provide policy solutions . but it does provide a rigorous , credible framework for policy debate – and thus an opportunity that no economy can afford to lose .
the World Bank ’ s Wrong Choice
new YORK – The selection of the American nominee Jim Yong Kim as President of the World Bank , over Nigeria ’ s finance minister , Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala , who was overwhelmingly regarded as a vastly superior candidate , is impossible to condone but easy to explain . it also points to serious dangers for the unfinished task of development .
the selection process suffered from several inequities and non-transparent features that undermined the United States ’ claim to the contrary . indeed , those claims were of a piece with the linguistic obfuscations that dominate American public debate : just as carpet bombing was called “ pacification ” during the Vietnam War , today illegal immigrants are called “ undocumented aliens . ”
thus , the rollout of the American propaganda machine for Kim , who traveled to many capitals worldwide with US Treasury support and promises of American largesse , surely biased the vote against Okonjo-Iweala . and , after all , the World Bank is a donor institution .
in a genuinely open , merit-based contest , the 25-member Executive Board ’ s deliberations should have been preceded by debates between the candidates . I suspect that Okonjo-Iweala , with her enormous competence and renowned wit , would have gotten the better of Kim .
while The Economist backed Okonjo-Iweala , The New York Times endorsed Kim . this is an election year in the US : if President Barack Obama had nominated a lamppost , America ’ s “ newspaper of record ” would have found it to be possessed of excellent credentials .
moreover , just as Ralph Nader ’ s candidacy ( and the US Supreme Court ) prevented Al Gore from defeating George W. Bush in 2000 , one must recognize that Okonjo-Iweala was undercut by the candidacy of José Antonio Ocampo , a former finance minister of Colombia , who was backed by Brazil . his candidacy made Okonjo-Iweala look like a regional “ African candidate , ” while Ocampo was the “ Latin American ” candidate .
Brazil should have worked with India , Mexico , and South Africa instead , to produce unified support for Okonjo-Iweala . when Brazil did move in that direction , it was too late to make any difference .
his tirade in 2000 against the liberal reforms that have transformed countries like India and China into global growth engines , reduced poverty , and benefited marginalized groups shows that he lacked good judgment on fundamental issues . no one recalls any expression of regret by him , which suggests that he persists in such folly – and would use conditionality to turn the clock back on decades of progress in development economics .
but my fear is that Kim would be a disaster even on health-care issues – an area where he has rightly earned credit for his work on AIDS , malaria , and tuberculosis . thanks to the economic growth that resulted from the reforms that he denounced , countries like India and Brazil now have higher revenues to spend on health care for the poor , among other public goods .
can Kim lead on these and other issues that are beyond his experience ?
the World Cup and African Women
Nairobi – When I was born , 25 years ago , it would have been rare – even taboo – to find African women discussing soccer . but that is what my girlfriends and I now do .
I grew up in Kenya , where my compatriots follow the English Premier League zealously , perhaps because of our colonial connection to England . Kenyans are so passionate about the Premier League that last year an Arsenal fan , Suleiman Omondi , hanged himself after his team lost to Manchester United .
we console each other when Chelsea loses , and worry together when our team plays big clubs , like recently when they played Liverpool , the only major contender that stood between Chelsea and the English title . fortunately , Chelsea won .
but , as the World Cup moves into its quarter and semi-final matches , my girlfriends have started to argue . although we don ’ t exchange blows like men , we are just as passionate , especially since the world ’ s most famous tournament is being played on our continent .
we were torn between the natural instinct to root for our brothers and the urge to side with the likes of Argentina , Brazil , Italy , Germany , and others who seemed more likely to win . initially , I supported France , because I like Chelsea ’ s Nicolas Anelka , though as an African woman I also could not resist the dream of chanting with joy those times when an African team won .
a senior sports writer with a Kenyan daily paper recently told me that this time women seem to be interested in learning the rules of the game and knowing more about players and their positions . they want to enjoy the game , rather than sit in the company of their male relatives , oblivious to what ’ s happening on the pitch .
holding the 1994 World Cup in the United States increased soccer ’ s popularity there and led to the creation of Major League Soccer in 1996 . and , in 1999 , the US hosted and won its second women ’ s World Cup , leading to a women ’ s soccer revolution in the country .
Dludlu has been playing since the age of 10 , and currently plies her trade at Tuks FC in Pretoria , where she is also studying at university . in 2006 Dludlu got her first call to join the Banyana Banyana , as the South African women ’ s team is called , and has 33 caps .
although women ’ s soccer in Africa is as old as the republics themselves ( the first teams appeared in West Africa in early 1960 ) , soccer on the continent is still a man ’ s sport . most African wives dread the season .
even wives of men who watch the game at home have got other issues to deal with . for instance , Joyce , my former workmate , has a husband who is a diehard Manchester United fan .
given male dominance in African politics and soccer , any chance to improve the state of the sport that might arise from the 2010 World Cup will most likely benefit men . that is because in most African countries , even men ’ s national teams are struggling .
until brought to a level where they can compete in international tournaments beyond Africa , women ’ s soccer teams will continue to struggle . and , considering the rampant corruption that plagues our continent , it might take a century to see male soccer teams managed and funded sufficiently .
American women improved their game because soccer moms do not heavily rely on husbands to fund their daughters ’ training . as more African women continue to be educated , I dream of the day when we , too , will be able to decide for ourselves .
I was , however , encouraged to learn that in South Africa , women of my mother ’ s generation have been playing in a soccer league for five years . after the World Cup , Vakhegula Vakhegula ( The Grannies ) , a team of women between 50 and 84 years old , will travel to the US to play in the Veteran ’ s Cup .
systems at Risk
Geneva – Failure to adapt to climate change , persistent extreme weather , and major systemic financial failure are just three of 50 major risks monitored every year in the World Economic Forum ’ s Global Risks Report . it seems natural to draw connections among them , especially after a “ superstorm ” shut down Wall Street this past October .
more important , the report warns of the dangers of multiple systems failing . two of the world ’ s most fundamental systems , for example , are the economy and the environment ; their interplay underpins the first of three case studies of risk in this year ’ s report .
global growth remains slow ; and , with monetary and fiscal policies having a limited impact on economic recovery , governments have neither the resources nor the courage to push for major projects . not surprisingly , our survey group ranked chronic fiscal imbalances second among 50 global risks that are most likely to manifest themselves over the next ten years .
strong economies provide the leeway to invest in climate adaptation , while environmental stability ensures the breathing space needed to attend to economic problems . facing stresses on both systems simultaneously is like losing both engines on an airplane in mid-flight .
what happens if an apparently “ minor ” system – such as social media – sparks a “ major ” geopolitical crisis ? with the growing reach of social networks , information can spread worldwide almost instantaneously .
consider the real-world case of someone shouting “ Fire ! ” in a crowded theater . could something similar happen digitally , with a spark of misinformation igniting a conflagration and wreaking havoc before the truth is revealed ?
but experts are increasingly concerned about the potential for pandemics caused by bacteria resistant to all current antibiotics , while our intellectual-property system is failing to create adequate incentives for the development of new varieties . the director-general of the World Health Organization has warned that if the world falls back into a pre-antibiotic age , a scratch or throat infection could become lethal once again .
while , ideally , global risks would be met with global responses , the reality is that these risks manifest themselves mainly at the national level , and countries must address them largely on their own . so we need to assess national resilience by regularly evaluating critical subsystems within countries .
the WEF currently is developing metrics that could evaluate national subsystems across five factors of resilience – redundancy , robustness , resourcefulness , response , and recovery – by combining perception-based data with publicly available statistical data . initial perception-based data gathered by the Forum is pointing toward the importance of leadership ability , transparency , efficiency , and good relationships between public and private-sector stakeholders .
while the development of these metrics is in its early stages , the ultimate aim is to develop a practical diagnostic tool that would function as an “ MRI ” for national decision-makers to assess their countries ’ resilience to global risks . by revealing underlying weaknesses that more traditional risk-assessment methods may miss , we could pinpoint the structural reforms , behavioral changes , and strategic investments that increased resilience requires .
the result would not only directly benefit each country willing to engage in this process . it would also imply accelerated innovation in global governance , which we need more than ever for the sake of preserving the integrity of our most crucial systems .
the World ’ s Biggest Shock Absorber
at first glance , this is indeed less than the American program , which totals 6.2 % of GDP , of which 2 % will be spent in 2009 . but this impression is deceptive , since the German state , through the built-in flexibility of its extensive social-welfare system , already contributes to stabilizing the world economy .
indeed , Germany ’ s generous unemployment insurance policies ensure that people are able to maintain their consumption standards even if they lose their jobs . Germany even has short-time allowances that enable companies to reduce their employees ’ working hours , with the loss in earnings partly reimbursed by the state .
thus , the economic stimulus provided by the German state budget will amount to 4.4 % of GDP in 2009 . in the United States , the budget deficit in 2008 stood at 5.8 % of GDP , and , according to the same OECD forecast , will amount to 10.2 % of GDP in 2009 , which translates into exactly the same economic stimulus as in Germany , 4.4 % of GDP .
in addition , Germany has much more inner stability than the US , because it does not have the problem of heavily indebted households that are now restricted in their borrowing . German banks grant mortgages only to a maximum of 60 % of the value of a house , instead of the 100 % mortgages that were frequently seen in the US and United Kingdom .
likewise , there is also virtually no credit card debt in Germany , or other reasons for US-style household indebtedness . a normal German household is not on its last financial legs , and is therefore able to compensate for income losses by adjusting its savings .
thus , the stability of German consumption is currently the world economy ’ s strongest economic pillar . whereas German exports are falling at an annual rate of 20 % , the portion of imports that does not consist of intermediate products for export goods is stable , helping the world as a whole .
according to the OECD , the annualized flow of German goods exports from January 2008 to January 2009 declined by $ 173 billion more than the corresponding flow of imports fell , which means that Germany ’ s annualized trade surplus fell by the same amount . this is the strongest decline in net foreign demand facing a single country , or , equivalently , the strongest increase in a country ’ s net demand for foreign goods .
while Italy , like Germany and Japan , has added demand , totaling $ 6 billion , Spain has withdrawn $ 101 billion , the UK $ 50 billion and France $ 19 billion . the $ 7 trillion decline in US house prices over the past two years was equivalent to the explosion of an atomic bomb .
the World \ u0027s Runaway Train
the spectacular and historic global economic boom of the past six years is about to hit a wall . unfortunately , no one , certainly not in Asia or the United States , seems willing to bite the bullet and help engineer the necessary coordinated retreat to sustained sub-trend growth , which is necessary so that new commodity supplies and alternatives can catch up .
instead , governments are clawing to stretch out unsustainable booms , further pushing up commodity prices , and raising the risk of a once-in-a-lifetime economic and financial mess . all this need not end horribly , but policymakers in most regions have to start pressing hard on the brakes , not the accelerator .
don ’ t look to the US for leadership in a presidential election year . on the contrary , the US government has been handing out tax-rebate checks so that Americans will shop until they drop , and now Congress is talking about doing more .
desperate to sustain their political and economic momentum , most have taken a wide variety of steps to prevent their economies from feeling the full brunt of the commodity price hikes . as a result , higher commodity prices are eating into fiscal cushions rather than curtailing demand .
I am puzzled that so many economic pundits seem to think that the solution is for all governments , rich and poor , to pass out even more checks and subsidies so as to keep the boom going . Keynesian stimulus policies might help ease the pain a bit for individual countries acting in isolation .
isn ’ t this obvious ? yes , there is still a financial crisis in the US , but stoking inflation is an incredibly unfair and inefficient way to deal with it .
some central bankers tell us not to worry , because they will be much more disciplined than central banks were in the 1970 ’ s , when the world faced a similar commodity price spike . this time is different , though .
the historic influx of new entrants into the global work force , each aspiring to Western consumption standards , is simply pushing global growth past the safety marker on the speed dial . as a result , commodity resource constraints that we once expected to face in the middle of the twenty-first century are hitting us today .
why can ’ t our wonderfully flexible market economies roll with the punches ? won ’ t high prices cause people to conserve on consumption and seek out new sources of supply ?
but the process takes time , and , because of the rising weight of relatively inflexible emerging market economies in global consumption , adjustment will probably take longer than it did a few decades ago . oil exporters and China have been accounting for two-thirds of global oil demand growth in recent years .
rich country consumers are responding to higher energy prices , and it helps . new York City , for example , has seen a reduction of perhaps 5 % in private vehicles entering the city over the past six months .
it certainly is not getting any easier to drive around in places like São Paulo , Dubai , and Shanghai . for a variety of reasons , mostly related to government intervention , few emerging market economies can be categorized as having flexible resource demand , so commodity price spikes are not having a particularly big effect on demand .
expansions usually start collapsing when labor gets too scarce and too expensive . but the current expansion is unusual in that , due to unique ( in the modern era ) circumstances , labor constraints are not the problem .
no , this time , commodity resources are the primary constraint , rather than a secondary problem , as in the past . that is why commodity prices will just keep soaring until world growth slows down long enough for new supply and new conservation options to catch up with demand .
this runaway-train global economy has all the hallmarks of a giant crisis in the making – financial , political , and economic . will policymakers find a way to achieve the necessary international coordination ?
the Global Growth Quest
NEWPORT BEACH – What is the most urgent economic priority shared by countries as diverse as Brazil , China , Cyprus , France , Greece , Iceland , Ireland , Korea , Portugal , the United Kingdom , and the United States ?
yes , these are relevant and , in a handful of cases , urgent . but the number one challenge facing these countries is to develop growth models that can provide more ample , well-paid , and secure jobs amid a secular re-alignment of the global economy .
for both theoretical and practical reasons , this is a challenge that will not be met easily or quickly . and , when it is met , the process will most likely be partial and uneven , accentuating differences and posing tricky coordination issues at the national , regional , and global levels .
others ( think Cyprus , Iceland , Ireland , the UK , and the US ) resorted to unsustainable surges in leverage among financial institutions to fund private-sector activities , sometimes almost irrespective of underlying fundamentals . still others ( China and Korea ) exploited seemingly limitless globalization and buoyant international trade to capture growing market shares .
recent data from the International Monetary Fund highlight these models ’ simultaneous loss of effectiveness . global growth averaged only 2.9 % in the most recent five-year period , well below the level for virtually any such multi-year period going back to 1971 .
highly leveraged systems in finance-dependent economies were the first to hit a wall , surprising many who had uncritically bought into the “ Great Moderation ” – the idea that macroeconomic and asset-market volatility had eased permanently . the bold policy action that countered the initial disorder prevented a global depression , but it encumbered public-sector balance sheets .
some were pushed there by the high cost of containing the damage from banks ’ irresponsible behavior . facing immediate credit rationing and large output contractions , they could be stabilized only by exceptional official financing from abroad , and , in some extreme cases , by defaulting on past commitments ( including to bondholders and , most recently , bank depositors ) .
for other countries , including the US , medium-term issues came to the fore . but , rather than catalyzing sensible policy discussions , these issues played into polarized and polarizing politics , creating new and more immediate headwinds to economic growth .
meanwhile , a highly interdependent and ( now ) less dynamic world economy has been limiting the scope for external growth drivers . accordingly , even countries with sound balance sheets and manageable leverage have experienced a growth slowdown .
with insufficient growth to deleverage safely , social costs have been considerable . alarmingly high youth unemployment , shrinking social safety nets , and under-investment in infrastructure and human capital are burdening current generations and , in a growing number of cases , will adversely affect future generations as well .
in the process , inequality has risen further . and yet , despite the urgent need for major policy adaptations at the national level , and much better regional and global coordination , progress has been disappointing .
with the political context undermining the right mix of short- and longer-term measures , national policymaking has stumbled into partial approaches and unusual experimentation . the focus has been on buying time , rather than on implementing a sensible transition to a sustainable policy stance .
the regional and multilateral dimensions are similarly inadequate . the absence of well-articulated common analyses and policy coordination has accentuated legitimacy deficits , encouraging leaders and publics to opt for partial narratives and eroding confidence in existing institutional structures .
given these trends , the search for more robust growth models will take much longer and be more complicated than many recognize – especially as the world economy pivots away from unfettered globalization and high levels of leverage .
notwithstanding a dysfunctional Congress , the private sector will increasingly convert a paralyzing uncertainty premium , which impedes much investment , into a less disruptive risk premium . but , without a short-term economic turbo-charger , the recovery in growth and jobs will remain gradual , vulnerable to political and policy risks , and disproportionately beneficial to those with favorable initial endowments of wealth and globalized talents .
governments ’ role will be different in countries like China , where officials will guide a shift from dependence on external sources of growth to more balanced demand . as this requires some fundamental domestic re-alignments , the rebalancing will be both gradual and non-linear at times .
the outlook for other economies is more uncertain . undermined by a lack of policy flexibility , it will take a long time for countries like Cyprus to overcome the immediate shock of crisis and revamp their growth models .
left to their own devices , these multi-speed dynamics would translate into higher global growth overall , coupled with larger internal and cross-country disparities – often exacerbated by demographics . the question is whether existing governance systems can coordinate effective intervention to counter the resulting tensions .
simultaneous progress on both substance and process is needed . parliaments and multilateral institutions must do a better job at facilitating cooperative policy implementation , which will require a willingness to reform outmoded institutions , including political lobbying .
the stronger sectors ( within countries and across them ) will continue to recover , but not enough to pull up the global economy whole As a result , weaker sectors risk being surpassed at an ever-faster pace . these trends will become more difficult to reconcile and keep orderly if governance systems fail to adjust .
the Wrong Growth Strategy for Japan
Cambridge – Japan ’ s new government , led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , could be about to shoot itself in the foot . seeking to boost economic growth , the authorities may soon destroy their one great advantage : the low rate of interest on government debt and private borrowing .
the interest rate on Japan ’ s ten-year government bonds is now less than 1 % – the lowest in the world , despite a very high level of government debt and annual budget deficits . indeed , Japan ’ s debt is now roughly 230 % of GDP , higher than that of Greece ( 175 % of GDP ) and nearly twice that of Italy ( 125 % of GDP ) .
Japan ’ s government is able to pay such a low rate of interest because domestic prices have been falling for more than a decade , while the yen has been strengthening against other major currencies . domestic deflation means that the real interest rate on Japanese bonds is higher than the nominal rate .
Abe has demanded that the Bank of Japan pursue a quantitative-easing strategy that will deliver an inflation rate of 2-3 % and weaken the yen . he will soon appoint a new BOJ governor and two deputy governors , who will , one presumes , be committed to this goal .
the yen ’ s value against the US dollar has declined by more than 7 % in the last month . with the euro rising relative to the dollar , the yen ’ s fall relative to the euro has been even greater .
the yen ’ s weakening will mean higher import costs , and therefore a higher rate of inflation . an aggressive BOJ policy of money creation could cause further weakening of the yen ’ s exchange rate – and a rise in domestic prices that is more rapid than what Abe wants .
with Japanese prices rising and the yen falling relative to other currencies , investors will be willing to hold Japanese government bonds ( JGBs ) only if their nominal yield is significantly higher than it has been in the past . a direct effect of the higher interest rate would be to increase the budget deficit and the rate of growth of government debt .
the government might be tempted to rely on rapid inflation to try to reduce the real value of its debt . fear of that strategy could cause investors to demand even higher real interest rates .
the combination of exploding debt and rising interest rates is a recipe for economic disaster . the BOJ ’ s widely respected governor , Masaaki Shirakawa , whose term expires in April , summarized the situation in his usual restrained way , saying that “ long-term interest rates may spike and have a negative effect on the economy . ”
a spike in long-term rates would lower the price of JGBs , destroying household wealth and , in turn , reducing consumer spending . the higher interest rates would also apply to corporate bonds and bank loans , weakening business investment .
the Japanese government has been able to sell its bonds to domestic buyers because of the high rate of domestic saving . the excess of saving over investment has given Japan a current-account surplus , allowing the country to finance all of the government borrowing domestically , with enough left over to invest in dollar-denominated bonds and other foreign securities .
the combination of high corporate saving and low business investment has sustained the current-account surplus , allowing Japan to fund its budget deficit domestically . but the surplus has fallen sharply in the past five years , from roughly 6 % of GDP in 2007 to only 1 % now .
it is not clear why Abe and his advisers believe that this will deliver sustained real GDP growth of 2 % a year . although the $ 120 billion is presumably just for the current year ( if the spending can be made to happen that quickly ) , he also spoke during his campaign about a ten-year rise in government spending of ¥ 200 trillion yen , substantially more than the $ 120 billion annual rate .
Abe is right about one thing : Japan needs to get out of its no-growth and deflationary trap . but the policies that he favors are not the way to do it .
Europe ’ s Next Great Mistake
Princeton – In constructing Europe ’ s monetary union , political leaders did not think through all of the implications , which led to major design flaws . worse , they do not appear to have learned from that experience , for they are about to take the same approach to the monetary union ’ s political analogue .
well before the crisis , the European Union was widely perceived to be suffering from a “ democratic deficit . ” Now , with many Europeans blaming the EU for painful austerity measures , that complaint has grown more powerful – and Europe ’ s political leaders believe that they must act now to address it .
the charismatic figures of the mid-twentieth century – Churchill , Adenauer , and de Gaulle – have no contemporary counterparts . citizens associate the EU with , above all , bureaucratic grayness and technocratic rationality .
European officialdom is now responding to these deficits with an initiative to reform and democratize the European Commission . current Commission President José Manuel Barroso suggests that ideologically like-minded political parties running in the next European Parliament elections should intensify their cooperation in political “ families ” that would then jointly nominate candidates for the Commission presidency .
this approach has been supported by luminaries such as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair . because it apparently does not imply any real loss of power for national governments , it has achieved a certain acceptance and seems close to being implemented .
electors chose only a representative for the House of Commons , and the majority party then appointed the prime minister . the contemporary British comic opera Iolanthe celebrated the fact that “ every boy and every gal that ’ s born into the world alive is either a little Liberal or else a little Conservative . ”
in the stable British model , if a political party is too radical , it will lose the political center in the next election . the parties ’ rivalry is healthy , though there is a built-in tendency to seek solutions that command a broad social consensus .
citizens could not understand why they should be expected to align their political preferences along a simple left-right spectrum . instead , politics was usually recast in terms of old inter-group or inter-ethnic tensions .
the contemporary United States also is not a compelling demonstration that competition between two parties leads to increasing moderation and political centrism . on the contrary , the partisan struggle can play to the parties ’ extremes .
the two-party moderation thesis makes sense only if the main differences concern redistributive preferences in a simple model driven by an almost Marxist kind of economic determinism . the left-wing party wants to redistribute wealth and incomes more , and the right-wing party less ; but both need to restrain themselves , and in appealing to the median voter , they become near-identical alternatives .
in a globally inter-connected world , however , a new politics has developed , in which both the left and right fringes fear that outside competition or influences will limit their ability to shape political choices . their main political preference then becomes resistance to those external threats .
artificially creating a new European polity split between left and right would create new struggles – and intensify old ones – about redistribution . the only thing that would hold the left together would be the claim that there should be more redistribution : but to whom , and according to what mechanism ?
nor is it clear that Spanish socialists have more in common with German social democrats than with their fellow nationals . each ideological grouping would most likely become factionalized along complex national lines – divisions likely to be reflected in the ensuing competition to be charismatic .
instead , all the major parties are represented in the government , and are consequently obliged to hammer out compromises . members of the federal government are driven by regional loyalties at some times , and by ideological commitments at other times ; they all need to be negotiated when making decisions .
the Swiss solution of electing an all-embracing and balanced government tends to produce boring and uninspiring politics . famously , few people know who even holds Switzerland ’ s annually rotating presidency .
charismatic politicians act by polarizing , galvanizing , and mobilizing supporters ; routine politics , by contrast , requires maintaining a low profile and being willing to strike compromises . Europe today does not need inspirational leaders who can whip up a populist frenzy .
the Wrong Tax for Europe
Cambridge – Europe is already in pickle , so why not add more vinegar ? that seems to be the thinking behind the European Commission ’ s proposed financial transactions tax ( FTT ) – the Commission ’ s latest response to Europe ’ s festering growth and financing problems .
ordinary Europeans have to pay value-added tax on most of the goods and services that they buy , so why not tax purchases of stocks , bonds , and all kinds of derivatives ? surely , such a tax will hit wealthy individuals and financial firms far more than anyone else , and , besides , it will raise a ton of revenue .
indeed , the European Commission estimates that its proposed tax of only 0.1 % on stock and bond trades , and 0.01 % tax on derivatives , will raise more than € 50 billion per year . as a bonus , an FTT will curb destabilizing speculation in financial markets .
a return to pre-2007 levels of macroeconomic and financial stability would support growth . unfortunately , much as FTTs are the darling of leading liberal economic commentators and Robin Hood NGOs , they are an extremely misguided approach to achieving such worthy ends .
true , great thinkers like John Maynard Keynes and the late Nobel laureate James Tobin floated various ideas for taxing financial transactions as a way to reduce economic volatility . ( Tobin ’ s tax applied specifically to foreign-exchange trading . )
and , while raising so much revenue with so low a tax rate sounds grand , the declining volume of trades would shrink the tax base precipitously . as a result , the ultimate revenue gains are likely to prove disappointing , as Sweden discovered when it attempted to tax financial transactions two decades ago .
in the long run , wages would fall , and ordinary workers would end up bearing a significant share of the cost . more broadly , FTTs violate the general public-finance principle that it is inefficient to tax intermediate factors of production , particularly ones that are highly mobile and fluid in their response .
all of this is well known , even if prominent opinion leaders , politicians , and philanthropists prefer to ignore it . the European Commission has surely been strongly cautioned by the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund , whose economists have thoroughly catalogued the pros and cons of FTTs .
after all , there certainly is a case to be made that an FTT has so much gut-level popular appeal that politically powerful financial interests could not block it . one can almost buy this idea , except that the tax is so counterproductive in the long run that it is hardly obvious that it would be better than nothing .
so , rather than finance the European Union ’ s institutions through greater contributions from existing tax bases , they are seeking a consensus for new revenue sources . or perhaps the Commission realizes that the FTT will be dead on arrival , owing to disputes within Europe , and simply wants to gain political capital from an enormously popular proposal .
after the financial crisis erupted with full force in 2008 , former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker claimed that the only worthwhile financial innovation in recent decades was the ATM . and , as the Oscar-winning documentary Inside Job rightly points out , no one whose other , less useful innovations helped cause the financial crisis – politicians , financiers , and many others – has really paid a price .
there is , in short , ample reason to be angry at financiers , and real change is needed in how they operate . but the FTT , despite its noble intellectual lineage , is no solution to Europe ’ s problems – or to the world ’ s .
the Wrong Way to Think About Oil
in his recent State of the Union address , President George W. Bush declared , “ America is addicted to oil . ” He announced a program of energy research that would reduce American oil imports from the Middle East by 75 % over the next two decades .
China and India , the two largest countries in the world , realize that their high rates of economic growth also depend upon foreign oil . while the two countries together consume slightly less than half as much oil as the US , their consumption is increasing faster .
China and India have been crisscrossing the globe making financially and politically costly deals to try to lock up the output of new oil-producing countries . for example , when Western countries discouraged their oil companies from dealing with Sudan ’ s government because of its inadequate response to the genocide in Darfur , China was quick to buy up the country ’ s oil .
others reply that new discoveries and improved technologies for extracting oil from existing fields make such projections too alarmist . because accurate statistics about reserves in countries like Saudi Arabia are not available , it is impossible to settle the dispute definitively .
in any case , arguments about the size of world oil reserves and when global production will peak misses the key security issue . the heart of the problem is not the overall quantity of oil , but its location .
oil supply is likely to be vulnerable to political disruptions long before issues arise from overall scarcity of supply . for China and India , that just reinforces their desire to lock up oil supplies from countries outside the Persian Gulf .
the US uses about 21 million barrels of oil a day , and imports about 2.5 million of it from the Persian Gulf . even before new technologies produce that amount of fuel , the US could switch to imports from Nigeria , Venezuela , and other countries .
Iran has threatened to cut oil exports if the United Nations Security Council imposes sanctions against it for violating its nuclear pledges . most experts predict that such a move would drive the price of oil – including the Venezuelan , Nigerian , and other oil that the US , China , and India consume – above $ 100 per barrel .
Arab oil-exporting countries embargoed oil sales to the US and the Netherlands to punish them for their support of Israel . but the oil destined for the US and the Netherlands was shifted to other countries like Japan , while oil destined for other countries found its way to the US and the Netherlands .
this means that China and India are deluding themselves if they think that preferential deals for Sudanese or Iranian oil will provide them with security . when a disruption occurs , China , India , and the US will all find that they face equal prices ­ ­ – and thus equal pain .
but over half the oil Americans use goes for driving cars and trucks . the US will not solve its energy security problem until it gets better at fuel economy , possibly by a combination of technology , gasoline taxes , and regulations .
oil was not the cause of the Iraq War in the simplistic sense that American control of Iraqi oil would make it more secure . the world ’ s dependence on Persian Gulf oil means that all countries have an interest in maintaining stability in that region , while improving energy efficiency and increasing the diversity of their overall energy supplies .
the Year of Rational Pessimism
by the same token , while there has been much concern about America ’ s political gridlock , something worse for America , and for the world , could have happened : the Republicans could have prevailed in their program of austerity-cum-redistribution to the wealthy . automatic cuts won ’ t happen until 2013 , which means that the economy in 2012 will be spared , ever so slightly .
two more positive notes for 2011 : America seems finally to have awakened to the yawning gap between the rich and the rest – between the top 1 % and everyone else . and youth-led protest movements , from the Arab Spring to the Spanish indignados and the Occupy Wall Streeters , have made clear that something is very wrong with the capitalist system .
the likelihood , though , is that the economic and political problems that were so manifest in the US and Europe in 2011 – and which have so far been tremendously mismanaged – will only grow worse in 2012 . any forecast for the coming year depends , more than usual , on politics – on the outcome of the US gridlock , and on European leaders ’ ability to respond to the euro crisis .
European leaders repeatedly proclaim their commitment to saving the euro , but those who could have repeatedly said that they are committed to not doing what is needed . they have recognized that austerity will mean slower growth – indeed , a recession is increasingly likely – and that , without growth , the eurozone ’ s distressed countries will not be able to manage their debts .
like it or not , the ECB is effectively financing the sovereigns . German leaders have frowned on this , and the ECB has felt uncomfortable , limiting its purchases and saying that political leaders , not central bankers , should save the euro .
but the political response has been too little , too late , to say the least . the most likely scenario is more of the same : austerity , weaker economies , more unemployment , and continuing deficits , with European leaders doing the minimum to fend off crisis for the moment .
the day of reckoning – when the euro breaks up or Europe takes the kind of definitive action that would make a single currency work – may come in 2012 , but , more likely than not , Europe ’ s leaders will do whatever they can to postpone that day of reckoning . Europe will suffer , and so will the rest of the world .
the United States had hoped for an export-led recovery , but , with economic growth slowing in Europe , its largest customer ( and impeding growth in much of the rest of the world ) , that is unlikely . and , with the worst effects of spending cuts potentially still to come , gridlock – and Republican spite – may mean that the Obama administration ’ s payroll-tax cut will not be extended , weakening household consumption .
no one in either US political party seems willing to face the fact that fixing the banking system , though necessary , was not sufficient to restore the economy to health ( or that the financial system was never really fixed ) . the American economy before the crisis was being maintained on artificial life support by a housing bubble that led to unsustainable consumption .
platitudes and placebos – vapid calls for more job creation , fiscal restraint , reining in entitlement programs , and so forth – will characterize America ’ s election year . neither side will step forward with a program for restructuring the economy and reducing the inequality that is sapping the country ’ s strength .
I have been a big critic of markets , but even America ’ s market participants now sense that political leaders are not up to the task . if investors suffered from irrational exuberance in the 1990 ’ s , they are likely to suffer from rational pessimism in the coming year .
but I am afraid that the risks are more on the downside . indeed , 2012 could prove to be the year in which the experiment with the euro , the culmination of a 50-year process of economic and political integration in Europe , comes to an end .
in that case , rather than bringing the hoped-for end of the Great Recession of 2008 , a downturn that has lasted too long and caused too much suffering , 2012 may mark the beginning of a new and more frightening phase of the world ’ s worst economic calamity in three-quarters of a century .
the Year of the “ China Model ”
the Olympic Games – no doubt perfectly organized , without a protester , homeless person , religious dissenter , or any other kind of spoilsport in sight – will probably bolster China ’ s global prestige . while the American economy gets dragged down further in a swamp of bad property debts , China will continue to boom .
to come back from near destitution and bloody tyranny in one generation is a great feat , and China should be saluted for it . but China ’ s success story is also the most serious challenge that liberal democracy has faced since fascism in the 1930 ’ s .
this is not because China poses a great military threat – war with the United States , or even Japan , is only a fantasy in the minds of a few ultra-nationalist cranks and paranoiacs . it is in the realm of ideas that China ’ s political-economic model , regardless of its environmental consequences , is scoring victories and looking like an attractive alternative to liberal democratic capitalism .
true , the European working class , not to mention women , did not have voting rights 200 years ago . but even during the most ruthless phases of Western capitalism , civil society in Europe and the US was made up of a huge network of organizations independent of the state – churches , clubs , parties , societies , and associations that were available to all social classes .
in China , by contrast , while individuals have regained many personal freedoms since the death of Maoism , they are not free to organize anything that is not controlled by the Communist Party . despite communism ’ s ideological bankruptcy , China has not changed in this regard .
the China Model is sometimes described in traditional terms , as though modern Chinese politics were an updated version of Confucianism . but a society where the elite ’ s pursuit of money is elevated above all other human endeavors is a far cry from any kind of Confucianism that may have existed in the past .
if anything has been laid to rest by China ’ s rising wealth , it is the comforting idea that capitalism , and the growth of a prosperous bourgeoisie , will inevitably lead to liberal democracy . on the contrary , it is precisely the middle class , bought off by promises of ever-greater material gains , that hopes to conserve the current political order .
it is also a source of vast amounts of money , much of which will end up in the tyrants ’ pockets . by proving that authoritarianism can be successful , China is an example to autocrats everywhere , from Moscow to Dubai , from Islamabad to Khartoum .
could there be a better place to do business , build stadiums and skyscrapers , or sell information technology and media networks than a country without independent trade unions or any form of organized protest that could lower profits ? meanwhile , concern for human or civic rights is denigrated as outmoded , or an arrogant expression of Western imperialism .
crises occur . what if the bargain struck between the Chinese middle classes and the one-party state were to fall apart , owing to a pause , or even a setback , in the race for material wealth ?
the closest thing , in some ways , to the China Model is nineteenth-century Germany , with its industrial strength , its cultivated but politically neutered middle class , and its tendency toward aggressive nationalism . nationalism became lethal when the economy crashed , and social unrest threatened to upset the political order .
the same thing could happen in China , where national pride constantly teeters on the edge of belligerence towards Japan , Taiwan , and ultimately the West . aggressive Chinese nationalism could turn lethal , too , if its economy were to falter .
this would not be in anyone ’ s interest , so we should wish China well in 2008 , while sparing a thought for all the dissidents , democrats , and free spirits languishing in labor camps and prisons . we should hope that they will live to see the day when the Chinese , too , will be a free people .
the Young General ’ s Old Tricks
Tokyo – Brinkmanship seems to be congenital in North Korea . under the late Kim Jong-il ’ s pudgy young successor – his third son , Kim Jong-un , dubbed “ the Young General ” – threats and mendacity still mark the Hermit Kingdom ’ s diplomacy .
with North Korea ’ s announcement of plans to use an Unha-3 rocket to launch its Bright Star-3 satellite into earth orbit in mid-April , the newest threat is a continuation of an old one . indeed , it signals a quick demise for the agreement reached with the United States just weeks ago .
the decision to launch the satellite , which had been planned by Kim Jong-il , is clearly intended to provide a “ heroic ” martial achievement for a new leader who lacks any military experience . the regime aims to boost North Korea ’ s international prestige and domestic morale simultaneously , with the population supposedly keen to support this show of the country ’ s technological and military might .
but no one , particularly in the region , where North Korean missiles pose the gravest threat , accepts this claim at face value . it is clear that the rocket to be launched is effectively a long-range ballistic missile , which might be able to reach Guam , the site of an important US military base .
so doubtful is the world of North Korea ’ s claim of peaceful intent that not only did the United Nations , South Korea , the US , Japan , and the European Union immediately express concern ; so did China and Russia – perhaps the only two countries in the world that are on good terms with the Kim regime .
despite the international community ’ s almost unanimous demand for restraint , North Korea is highly unlikely to roll back its launch plans . halting such missile tests is simply not an option for a regime whose only claim to legitimacy is the military threat that it poses to others .
the announcement of the forthcoming launch is timed , as always seems to be the case with North Korea ’ s provocations , to the regime ’ s need for food and funds from around the world to prevent the reemergence of mass starvation at home . moreover , 2012 is a special year for North Korea , starting with the 70th anniversary of Kim Jong-il ’ s birth on February 16 .
for the commemoration of Kim Jong-il ’ s birthday in February , a kilogram of fish was provided to residents in one district , but nowhere else . at the same time , the regime sought 240,000 tons of nutritional support in its recent negotiations with the US and South Korea , though the North was forced to return 30,000 tons of rice from a previous food-aid package as part of its recent agreement with the US .
indeed , the North lets few diplomatic occasions pass without strong-arming its interlocutors for more . for Kim Jong-un , even a meeting with Japanese officials in Ulan Bator , Mongolia ’ s capital , to discuss the return of Japanese women who went to North Korea with their Korean husbands thinking that they were journeying to a socialist paradise , served as a platform to secure food aid from Japan .
the negotiations were to be held between Song Il-ho , North Korea ’ s ambassador responsible for normalizing relations with Japan , and Hiroshi Nakai , a former minister who negotiates officially for the release of Japanese citizens abducted by the North . but Nakai was unable to leave Tokyo , and a university professor replaced him as Japan ’ s negotiator .
thus , the North Korean drama , now starring Kim Jong-un , plays on , relying on extorted proceeds from manufactured crises abroad to finance spectacular kitsch and brutal repression at home . it is up to China , the real director of the North Korean production , to drop the curtain on this abominable show and its rogue star .
thick as BRICS
in the coming weeks , most Latin American countries will vote in favor of some form of UN membership or recognition of statehood that the Palestinian Authority is seeking . but some will not .
in any case , the political consequences overshadow legal or bureaucratic issues . forcing the US to use its veto in the Security Council , or obtaining the support of more than 150 of the UN ’ s 193 member states in the General Assembly , would be a huge defeat for Israel and the US , which is why the Latin American votes are important .
Brazil has stated that it intends to vote in the Security Council in favor of recommending Palestine ’ s admission to the General Assembly ; Colombia has said that it plans to abstain .
in short , as was the case more than a half-century ago , the region has not spoken with a single voice on these crucial issues . now , as then , most Latin American countries have not taken a principled stand – either for or against Israel , or for or against the Palestinians .
first , they dispatched a three-country mission ( Brazil , India , and South Africa ) to Damascus to “ persuade ” Assad not to murder his people . needless to say , he did not respond that , yes , he had killed a few thousand here and there , but that now that they brought it up , he would try to be more careful .
given their growing role in the global economy , it is understandable that larger Latin American countries , along with the other BRICS , are seeking a more influential world role . this is not the way to achieve it .
thirty Years of “ Test-Tube ” Babies
Leon Kass , who subsequently served as chair of President George W. Bush ’ s Council on Bioethics , argued that the risk of producing an abnormal infant was too great for an attempt at IVF ever to be justified . some religious leaders also condemned the use of modern scientific technology to replace sexual intercourse , even when it could not lead to conception .
the risk of having an abnormal child through IVF has turned out to be no greater than when parents of a similar age conceive though sexual intercourse . however , because many IVF practitioners transfer two or three embryos at a time to improve the odds of a pregnancy occurring , twins and higher multiple births are more common , and carry some additional risk .
in addition , the Vatican objects to the fact that conception is the result of a “ technical action ” rather “ a specific act of the conjugal union . ” But while any couple would prefer to conceive a child without the intervention of doctors , that option is not available for infertile couples .
but if by that the Church is referring to sexual intercourse , then it surely has an unduly narrow view of what kinds of acts can express reciprocal love between a man and a woman . taking the several inconvenient and sometimes unpleasant steps required to have a child together by means of IVF can be , and often is , the result of a much more deliberate and reciprocally loving act than sexual intercourse .
why not , for example , criticize Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar , the Arkansas couple who recently had their 18th child ? yet Michelle Duggar was named “ Young Mother of the Year ” in Arkansas in 2004 , when she had already given birth to 14 children .
religious opposition notwithstanding , the use of IVF by infertile couples of normal reproductive age has been widely accepted around the world , and rightly so . but in countries where the Church ’ s influence remains strong , IVF ’ s opponents are fighting back .
last November , Rajo Devi , a 70-year-old Indian woman , became the world ’ s oldest mother , thanks to IVF . she and her 72 year-old husband have , she says , longed for a child through 55 years of marriage .
some will find it grotesque to become a mother at an age when most women are grandmothers , but the more significant question is what kind of care such children will have if their parents die or become incapable of rearing them . like many people in rural India , Devi lives in an extended family with other relatives , so she is confident that there would be others to bring up her child if necessary .
but , as this example suggests , the impact of parental age on a child ’ s welfare will vary from one culture to another . becoming a mother at 70 is more acceptable for someone living in a joint family than it would be for Western couples living in their own home without close relatives or friends nearby .
this Recovery is Different
Brussels – The misguided belief that “ this time is different ” led policymakers to permit the credit boom of the early 2000 ’ s to continue for too long , thus preparing the ground for the biggest financial crisis in living memory . but now , when it comes to recovery , the belief that this time should not be different might be equally dangerous .
by this standard , the current recovery is unacceptably slow , with both output and employment still below the previous peak . policymakers thus feel justified in using all available macroeconomic levers to achieve a recovery that resembles those of the past .
to some extent , it should have been logical to expect an unprecedented upturn as well . when the crisis erupted , many hoped for a V-shaped recovery , notwithstanding a substantial body of research showing that recoveries from recessions caused by a financial crisis tend to be weaker and slower than recoveries from “ normal ” recessions .
the observation that recoveries following a financial crisis are different suggests that standard macroeconomic policies might not work as one would usually expect . and a transatlantic comparison suggests that this may indeed be the case .
one would expect that the shock from the financial crisis should be comparable for the United States and the eurozone , given that they are of similar size , exhibit a similar degree of internal diversity , and experienced a similar increase in house prices ( on average ) in the years preceding the bust . moreover , the relative increase in debt ( leverage ) in the financial system was similar on both sides of the Atlantic .
and , indeed , US economic performance has been very similar to that of the eurozone since the start of the crisis : GDP per capita today is still about 2 % below the 2007 level on both sides of the Atlantic . the unemployment rate in the US and the eurozone has increased by about the same amount as well – three percentage points .
for Ireland and Spain , read Nevada and California ( and , for Greece , read Puerto Rico ) . the proper comparison is thus between the average of two continental-sized economies , both of which are characterized by considerable internal diversity .
of course , one could argue that the UK was particularly exposed to the bust , because financial services make up a large part of its GDP . but the fact remains that its economy , supposedly the most flexible in Europe , has not recovered from the shock five years later , despite massive fiscal and monetary stimulus , coupled with a substantial devaluation .
on balance , it thus seems that this time – or , rather , this post-crisis environment – really is different , and that macroeconomic policies have done little to improve matters . countries like the US and the UK , which are accumulating debt at a record pace , are betting that deficit spending will eventually pay off in a stronger economy .
history suggests that interest rates will not remain at record-low levels indefinitely , and that when change comes , it might be abrupt . why should we expect this time to be different ?
Thailand ’ s Democratic Disorder
Bangkok – From Thailand to Turkey to Ukraine , the relationship between ruling majorities and electoral minorities has become combustible – and is threatening to erode the legitimacy of democracy itself . the unfolding crisis in Bangkok – where a political minority has taken to the streets to bring down Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ’ s democratically elected government – is a case in point .
but the opposition Democratic Party – which returned 159 MPs , mainly from Bangkok and southern Thailand – has lately been staging protests in the capital . the so-called “ People ’ s Committee for Democratic Reform ” – led by former Democratic Party MP Suthep Thaugsuban and supported by the Bangkok-based establishment – has effectively attempted to stage a coup .
( it also would have superseded the murder charges brought against the Democratic Party ’ s leader , former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva . ) But Yingluck ’ s subsequent attempt to backtrack on the amnesty measure failed to mollify the opposition .
the government asserted that the court did not have jurisdiction over constitutional amendments . the People ’ s Committee viewed this rejection as an attempt to pressure the king into countersigning the law – and thus as a threat to royal prerogatives and the king ’ s exalted role in Thailand .
the People ’ s Committee ’ s position deserves explanation , if not agreement . since the turn of the century , Thaksin ’ s party machines , powered by his populist policies , have overcome constant challenges – from both the military and the Constitutional Court – to beat the conservative-royalist Democrats in every election .
but the minority – which comprises up to two-fifths of the electorate – is at a loss . its legitimacy and influence depend not on winning electoral majorities , but on its strong alliances with the military , bureaucracy , and judiciary in defense of a traditional hierarchy that places the king at its apex .
making matters worse , voters on both sides are tuning in only to views with which they agree , rather than attempting to understand and reconcile opposing arguments . social media – the much-lauded catalyst of democratization in authoritarian countries – has exacerbated the trend toward polarization in Thailand , just as it has in other electoral democracies that are struggling with a widening majority-minority divide , like Turkey and Malaysia .
in emerging democracies , electoral minorities tend to be tied to the old establishment , and often oppose change led by popular upstarts . feeling marginalized and resentful , they may turn to public platforms like social media and the streets to advance their causes and undermine their opponents ’ authority .
the proliferation of information technology , together with the unprecedented popular participation that it has fueled , means that electoral minorities have a growing number of increasingly powerful tools at their disposal to organize movements aimed at paralyzing their countries ’ governments and even shortening leaders ’ terms in office . indeed , with so much seemingly at stake , a four- or five-year term may seem too long to wait for change .
but , while the right to peaceful protest is critically important in a democracy , electoral minorities should not use endless demonstrations to take the political system hostage . in order to create a peaceful , stable , and effective democratic system , electoral minorities must accept the ballot box as the arbiter of political legitimacy .
while the government must deliver for its constituents , it must also protect its opponents ’ rights . to this end , Thailand urgently needs a new social contract that allows elected representatives to do their jobs , without marginalizing the establishment-based minority .
increasingly complex majority-minority dynamics are shaping the democratization prospects of a number of countries , and could influence democracy ’ s durability as a system of government . Thailand ’ s experience suggests that efforts to subvert the system by thwarting the will of the majority may ultimately be fruitless , though not before imposing extremely high costs on everyone .
climate and Competitiveness
since the early 2000 ’ s , average electricity prices for Europe ’ s industries have more or less doubled , and European companies now pay twice as much for gas as their US competitors do . are Europe ’ s highly ambitious climate policies – which seek to increase costs for “ bad ” energy sources – destroying the continent ’ s industrial base ?
how can such a huge price gap not have an impact on competitiveness ? but if high energy prices lead to declining exports , how is it that Germany , which boasts some of the world ’ s most ambitious climate policies , has doubled its exports since 2000 ?
in fact , empirical evidence shows that in many cases , further reducing carbon-dioxide emissions might help to make industries more competitive . exploring this potential could open up significant opportunities not only to combat climate change , but also to foster Europe ’ s long-term economic robustness .
since 2005 , when the European Union introduced its Emissions Trading System , German industry has achieved massive gains in market share , despite energy prices having risen much faster than in the US and elsewhere . according to OECD estimates , the relative export performance of high-cost Germany increased by 10 % from 2005 to 2013 , while US exports grew only 1.2 % faster than demand in the rest of the world .
despite already-high and rising energy prices , Europe ’ s chemical industry has grown at about the same rate as the rest of the economy since 1995 . today , EU chemical companies specialize in high-value products , and Europe exports much more of them than it imports .
indeed , estimates for Germany show that for most of its industrial base , energy costs account for a mere 1.6 % of gross value added . thus , even rapidly rising energy prices imply only a limited additional cost burden for firms .
and , even in these sectors , competitiveness must be defined in a much broader sense than that given simply by comparing cost statistics . for example , factors like highly qualified labor , or the benefits of being integrated into well-functioning clusters , probably play a more important role .
clearly , such considerations provide no guarantee that rising energy prices will not at some point seriously challenge European competitiveness . indeed , new investment in chemical plants has grown only slowly for years now .
but , while this risk must be taken seriously , history suggests that there may well be a way out that does not require rolling back climate policies . what is notable is that rising energy prices have been accompanied not only by relatively robust competitiveness , but also by huge reductions in CO2 emissions .
moreover , in an estimated 60-70 % of cases , exploring the additional abatement opportunity would have no effect – or would even strengthen – the industry ’ s competitiveness . this is because greater reliance on recycling , for example , reduces costs – and thus enhances companies ’ competitiveness – while reducing emissions and driving new approaches like cross-sector innovation .
there are smarter ways to reduce emissions than just raising costs for industry and consumers . but it would be equally senseless to push for less ambitious policies , thereby stalling progress in the fight against climate change , without being sure that doing so would improve European competitiveness .
the new paradigm should focus on finding ways to reduce CO2 emissions in ways that ultimately help to produce better products at lower cost . this will also help European producers capture new markets in emerging countries , which will increasingly demand the high-value chemical products that Europe already produces competitively .
the last thing a crisis-weary Europe needs is a new competitiveness gap . but ambitious climate targets , as Germany and other successful European economies have shown , are not the problem .
Threading the Fiscal Needle
PALO ALTO – Elections often turn on the state of the economy , especially in hard times . when growth and jobs are down , voters throw out incumbents – whether Spanish leftists , French rightists , or Dutch centrists .
the Great Depression was intensified by poor monetary policy , tax hikes , and protectionist trade policies . likewise , loose US monetary policy in the middle of the last decade helped to set the stage for the Great Recession by contributing significantly to an explosion of leverage and fueling the housing bubble that burst in 2007-2008 .
the first is between “ austerity ” and “ growth ” – &amp; nbsp ; that is , short-term deficit reduction and additional fiscal stimulus . many on the left , on both sides of the Atlantic , argue that more , not less , government spending is required to lift their economies out of recession .
in particular , Germany demands more fiscal belt-tightening from heavily indebted Southern European countries , whose unions ( and voters ) are rejecting further austerity . while the US has thus far avoided the bond market ’ s wrath , American political leaders confront the same problem of debt and fiscal sustainability . &amp; nbsp ;
the second battle involves long-run structural issues : slowing the growth of government spending , reforming taxes , and increasing labor-market flexibility . in Europe , for example , raising the retirement age for public pensions and shrinking government employment would curtail welfare-state excesses .
in the US , Reagan ’ s victory in 1980 appeared to signal that America would stop well short of the European social-welfare model . but President Barack Obama and his congressional allies have rejected the consensus that government should be only a last resort for those in need , in favor of greater dependence , for both individuals and firms , on entitlement programs and other public spending , targeted tax breaks , regulations , and loans .
separating the budget ’ s effects on the economy from those of the economy on the budget is tricky . there are several cases – Ireland and Denmark in the 1980 ’ s , for example – in which fiscal consolidation helped to expand the economy in the short run , as lower interest and exchange rates boosted confidence enough to stimulate demand .
of course , if many of the world ’ s economies attempt to consolidate simultaneously , with interest rates already low and some of the largest in a monetary union , such a favorable result is less likely . but the evidence on whether additional deficit-financed spending would quickly revive economic growth is mixed .
in a recent survey , “ Fiscal Policy for Economic Growth , ” I concluded that short-run multipliers – the total change in economic activity resulting from higher government spending – could theoretically be as large as two when the central bank has reduced its target interest rate to zero . in other words , one dollar spent by the government could boost GDP by two dollars in the very short run .
the catch is that the multiplier turns negative by year two : extra government spending contracts , rather than expands , medium-term and long-term economic growth . moreover , the short-run effect is lower in highly indebted countries , and can even be negative during economic expansions if households and firms , expecting higher taxes to pay for future spending , save , rather than spend , the cash .
but those now demanding further deficit-financed stimulus must confront considerable evidence that an overhang of public debt impedes growth for a long time . in a recent paper following up on their book This Time is Different , the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff concluded that debt / GDP ratios above 90 % tend to be associated with an annual growth slowdown of a full percentage point for 23 years .
Europe requires structural labor-market reform and must resolve its sovereign-debt overhang , banking crises , and the euro ’ s future . America must reform its tax code to raise revenue across a wider array of people and economic activity ( half the US population pays no federal income tax , and the tax code either excludes or favorably treats many income sources ) .
over the next several years – the medium term – all countries should implement difficult-to-reverse fiscal consolidation , which would persuade the private sector that a gradual or delayed adjustment , primarily on the spending side of the budget , will occur . successful consolidation generally relies on spending cuts rather than tax increases – indeed , at a ratio of five or six to one .
in the short run , spending flexibility is appropriate only if medium- and long-term measures are in place . that compromise – between Germany and Southern Europe , and between US Republicans and Democrats – should be economically and politically feasible .
with many citizens now struggling , political leaders face a daunting task : adopt credible medium- and long-term reforms without derailing the economy in the short term . they have little economic – and perhaps even less political – margin for error .
three Paths for Indebted Democracies
Chicago – Democratic governments are not incentivized to take decisions that have short-term costs but produce long-term gains , the typical pattern for any investment . indeed , in order to make such investments , democracies require either brave leadership or an electorate that understands the costs of postponing hard choices .
consider , for example , the cacophony of arguments about government spending : is it the only thing keeping depression at bay , or is it moving us steadily down the road to perdition ? the debate does not lead to agreement , moderate voters do not know what to believe , and policy choices ultimately follow the path of least resistance – until they run into a brick wall .
the build-up of public debt in industrial countries ( which was rising briskly well before the Great Recession pushed it to near-unsustainable levels ) reflects this kind of calculus . the public rewards democratic governments for dealing with the downside risk caused by competitive markets – whether by spending to create jobs or by rescuing banks that have dodgy securities on their balance sheets .
even if inaction ( or action oriented towards the longer term ) is the best policy , it is not an option for democratically elected politicians , whom voters expect to govern , which inevitably means action with the potential for quick results . a sympathetic press amplifies heart-rending stories of lost jobs and homes , making those counseling against intervention or advocating longer-term fixes appear callous .
one is that they intervene directly in markets , both domestic and across borders , to reduce competition and volatility while they rebuild their buffering capacity . another is that they muzzle democracy to suppress public anger .
all three were tried during the Great Depression of the 1930 ’ s . the results were not encouraging .
one factor diminishing the likelihood of governments intervening more directly in markets is that the recent crisis seems to have discredited government as much as it discredited the financial sector . during the Great Depression , matters were different .
legislation such as the US Glass-Steagall Act clipped their wings . many bankers also suffered direct losses as their banks collapsed , or as investigations exposed them to public ridicule , and even jail .
today , by contrast , broad segments of the public see the big banks and big government as being run by the same elites who created the crisis , and then spent public money under one guise or another bailing the banks out . even as bankers are back to reaping enormous bonuses , taxpayers have been left to foot the bill for the economic collapse .
the biggest banks now account for an even larger share of the financial sector after benefiting from a government rescue , while efforts like the Dodd-Frank Act to legislate more constraints on banks have been lobbied into shadows of their original selves . the elite , whether in government or big business , seems to look after itself and no one else .
in the eurozone , in addition to the perceived nexus between banks and governments , the governing elite ’ s willingness to embrace European integration , and taxpayer-financed cross-border financial support , without broad public consultation has generated a similar sentiment . in Japan , two decades of relentless economic malaise has decimated the public ’ s faith in politicians and the government bureaucracy .
the second undesirable possibility – that governments with little spending capacity to assuage public anger turn against democracy and free expression – is also remote for now . democratic institutions in industrial countries are stronger , and have deeper roots , than was the case in the 1930s .
that leaves the third undesirable possibility , the search for unprotected scapegoats upon whom public anger can be dissipated . unfortunately , several countries are taking this path , with undocumented immigrants and Muslims being the first targets .
politicians who seek scapegoats might argue that they mean no harm to their targets , and that they are helping their societies to avoid worse possibilities . but , as the 1930 ’ s showed , it is hard to imagine any possibility worse than where this type of behavior can lead .
which Way for US Foreign Policy ?
but such charges are partisan political rhetoric , with little basis in rigorous policy analysis . it is more accurate to see the current mood as a swing of the US foreign policy pendulum between what Columbia University ’ s Stephen Sestanovich has called “ maximalist ” policies and “ retrenchment ” policies .
retrenchment is not isolationism ; it is an adjustment of strategic goals and means . presidents who followed policies of retrenchment since the end of World War II have included Dwight Eisenhower , Richard Nixon , Jimmy Carter , and now Obama .
while Nixon believed the US was in decline , the others did not . all of them were strong internationalists when compared to the true isolationists of the 1930s , who bitterly opposed coming to the aid of Britain in WWII .
historians can make a credible case that periods of maximalist over-commitment have done more damage to America ’ s place in the world than periods of retrenchment . domestic political reaction to Woodrow Wilson ’ s global idealism produced the intense isolationism that delayed America ’ s response to Hitler .
if that mood is to become an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign , as early campaign rhetoric suggests , Americans should drop the false debate about isolationism and instead address three fundamental questions about the future of the country ’ s foreign policy : how much ? how interventionist ?
although some argue that America has no choice but to curtail its outlays in these areas , this is not the case . as a share of GDP , the US is spending less than half of what it did at the peak of the Cold War , when the century of American leadership was being consolidated .
the problem is not guns vs. butter , but guns vs. butter vs. taxes . without a willingness to raise revenues , defense expenditure is locked in a zero-sum tradeoff with important investments such as education , infrastructure , and research and development – all of which are crucial to America ’ s domestic strength and global position .
Obama has said that America should use military force , unilaterally if necessary , when its security or that of its allies is threatened . when not , but conscience urges the country to act – against , say , a dictator killing a large number of his citizens – the US should not intervene alone and should use force only if there is a good prospect of success .
nearly two centuries ago , John Quincy Adams , America ’ s sixth president , was wrestling with domestic demands for intervention in the Greek war for independence when he famously said that the US “ goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy . ” But what if forbearance in a civil war like Syria ’ s allows a terrorist group like the Islamic State to establish a safe haven ?
the US should stay out of the business of invasion and occupation . in an age of nationalism and socially mobilized populations , foreign occupation , as Eisenhower wisely concluded in the 1950s , is bound to breed resentment .
but the US ignores the third question at its peril . how can America bolster institutions , create networks , and establish policies for managing transnational issues ?
unfortunately , America ’ s domestic political gridlock often blocks this . for example , the US Senate has failed to ratify the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea , despite its being in America ’ s national interest – indeed , the US needs the convention to support its position on how to resolve competing territorial claims in the South China Sea .
similarly , Congress failed to fulfill an American commitment to support the reallocation of voting power within the International Monetary Fund to emerging-market countries , though doing so would cost very little . this paved the way for China to launch its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ( which the US then mistakenly tried to block , at considerable cost to its reputation . )
but Americans should be equally concerned that their country ’ s “ exceptionalism ” is degenerating into “ exemptionalism . ” How can the US maintain global leadership if other countries see Congress constantly blocking international cooperation ?
three Strikes Against the Drug War
Mexico CITY – The last two months have witnessed more far-reaching changes on the drug-policy scene in Latin America and the United States than in all previous decades combined . three fundamental shifts have occurred , each of which would be important on its own ; taken together , they may be a game-changer that finally ends the hemisphere ’ s failed war on drugs .
first and foremost were the referenda on marijuana legalization in the US states of Colorado and Washington on November 6 . for the first time , voters in the country that is the world ’ s largest consumer of illicit drugs in general , and marijuana in particular , approved propositions legalizing possession , production , and distribution of cannabis – and by relatively broad margins .
just as important , however , was President Barack Obama ’ s reaction to the Colorado and Washington votes – both states that he won easily in his re-election bid . the legal and political challenges implied are no minor matter : marijuana remains an illicit substance under US federal law and international conventions that America has adopted .
first , he said that enforcing federal marijuana legislation in Colorado and Washington was not a priority of his administration ; he had “ other fish to fry . ” Second , he reiterated his own opposition to legalization , but then added : “ at this point . ”
the third change in recent months occurred in one of the world ’ s largest drug-supplying countries : Mexico , through which practically all of the illegal drugs shipped to the US – cocaine , heroin , marijuana , and methamphetamines – must pass . on December 1 , Enrique Peña Nieto succeeded Felipe Calderón as President .
the advocacy group Human Rights Watch wrote a public letter to the new president , asking what he intends to do about the thousands of missing Mexicans . then , in a series of leaks and explicit statements , the new government pointed out the previous policies ’ high legal , bureaucratic , and financial costs , and that many more crimes of all types were committed , despite sharply higher spending on law enforcement and security .
consequently , the main advocates of this approach ( Calderón , former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe , the current and former presidents of Brazil , and America ’ s conservatives and security establishment ) are losing public support . proponents of a different strategy ( Presidents Juan Manuel Santos and Otto Peréz Molina of Colombia and Guatemala , respectively , among others ) , based on public-health premises and legalization , are gaining ground .
Uruguay is expected to approve legislation fully legalizing marijuana in January ; the Organization of American States is scheduled to deliver a report to the region ’ s heads of state at mid-year on alternative drug-enforcement strategies and existing “ best practices ” in other countries . and more US states will most likely either approve full-fledged marijuana legalization or its medicinal use ( 18 states already allow it ) .
it will not occur overnight , or everywhere , or in regard to all drugs . but , after decades of bloodshed , repression , and criminalization , things have begun to move in the right direction .
thrifty China , Spendthrift America
China ’ s gross saving rate ( the percentage of GDP that is not consumed immediately ) , which includes both public and private saving , is around 50 % . by contrast , the saving rate in the United States is the lowest of any major country – roughly 10 % of GDP .
differences in saving rates matter a lot , and must be a major reason that China ’ s annual economic growth rate is now a full six percentage points higher than in the US . if people are saving half their income , their investments in capital have the potential to propel the economy at a rapid pace .
the difference between Chinese and US saving rates has been growing for decades . in the early 1980 ’ s , China ’ s saving rate was twice as high .
countries with serious internal crises or conflicts tend to save little . but neither of these patterns tells us anything about the difference between the US and China .
some part of the high saving rates in China since the early 1980 ’ s might be due to the decline in public confidence about health care , retirement benefits , and education , and a weakened sense of job security . however , the same factors seem to be working in the same direction for saving in the US , too .
when incomes are growing rapidly , as they are in China , it is easier to save because people are not yet accustomed to a higher standard of living and do not mind terribly much maintaining a lower one for a while longer . they also tolerate enterprise or government policies that encourage high saving .
this prevented the birth rate from rebounding after the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76 . the late Nobel laureate economist Franco Modigliani , in his last major published paper in 2004 ( co-authored with Shi Larry Cao ) , argued that this demographic change explains much of the increase in the saving rate , as Chinese substituted investment in capital for investment in children .
but income growth and demographics do not explain everything . after all , the virtuous circle of high savings and rapid growth operates more strongly in China than in other developing countries where incomes are rising and birth rates are falling .
this suggests that there are other , deeper factors that underlie the differences in Chinese and US saving rates – factors that reflect different life experiences and how these experiences are filtered through the two countries ’ cultures .
likewise , 83.5 % of Chinese thought their country is run for all the people , rather than for a few big interest groups , whereas only 36.7 % of Americans thought the same of their country . with this relatively higher trust , China ’ s government and enterprises are better able to enact and implement strict policies that promote saving and growth .
moreover , while economic inequality is on the rise in both countries , Chinese and Americans comprehend this very differently . in the US , widely called “ the land of opportunity , ” the shame of being poor is unbearable , and there are no cultural resources to enable such people to maintain self-esteem , especially when the country is so successful overall .
people still remember the Cultural Revolution and view themselves as survivors of a shared traumatic experience , underpinning a commitment to collective sacrifice in order to rebuild the country . there is no shame in being poor in China if one reflects that one ’ s children or grandchildren will be wealthy and successful .
especially in Chinese villages , people know how their neighbors are faring . conspicuous consumption becomes less important when people already know your income .
but there is relatively less pleasure in public displays of consumption at a time when the prevailing national story is one of triumph over adversity . more vivid in people ’ s minds are the stories they will one day tell their grandchildren about their travails and their economic heroism .
today ’ s children will not view their own life stories from the perspective of the difficulties China has experienced . as this change unfolds , the enormous willingness to save , and to tolerate high-saving government policies , will fade .
Tibet ’ s Peace of the Grave
Prague – The recent events in Tibet and adjoining provinces are causes for deep concern . indeed , the dispersal of a peaceful protest march organized by Tibetan monks , which led to a wave of unrest that was brutally suppressed by the Chinese military and police , has caused indignation all over the democratic world .
indeed , the language used by some Chinese government representatives and the official Chinese media is a reminder of the worst of times during the Stalinist and Maoist eras . but the most dangerous development of this unfortunate situation is the current attempt to seal off Tibet from the rest of the world .
even as we write , it is clear that China ’ s rulers are trying to reassure the world that peace , quiet , and “ harmony ” have again prevailed in Tibet . we all know this kind of peace from what has happened in the past in Burma , Cuba , Belarus , and a few other countries – it is called the peace of the graveyard .
merely urging the Chinese government to exercise the “ utmost restraint ” in dealing with the Tibetan people , as governments around the world are doing , is far too weak a response . the international community , beginning with the United Nations and followed by the European Union , ASEAN , and other international organizations , as well as individual countries , should use every means possible to step up pressure on the Chinese government to
unless these conditions are fulfilled , the International Olympic Committee should seriously reconsider whether holding this summer ’ s Olympic Games in a country that includes a peaceful graveyard remains a good idea .
Tiger Mothers or Elephant Mothers ?
Melbourne – Many years ago , my wife and I were driving somewhere with our three young daughters in the back , when one of them suddenly asked : “ Would you rather that we were clever or that we were happy ? ”
I was reminded of that moment last month when I read Amy Chua ’ s Wall Street Journal article , “ Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior , ” which sparked more than 4,000 comments on wsj.com and over 100,000 comments on Facebook . the article was a promotional piece for Chua ’ s book , Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother , which has become an instant bestseller .
Chua ’ s thesis is that , when compared to Americans , Chinese children tend to be successful because they have “ tiger mothers , ” whereas Western mothers are pussycats , or worse . Chua ’ s daughters , Sophia and Louise , were never allowed to watch television , play computer games , sleep over at a friend ’ s home , or be in a school play .
Chinese mothers , according to Chua , believe that children , once they get past the toddler stage , need to be told , in no uncertain terms , when they have not met the high standards their parents expect of them . ( Chua says that she knows Korean , Indian , Jamaican , Irish , and Ghanaian mothers who are “ Chinese ” in their approach , as well as some ethnic-Chinese mothers who are not . )
but Chua , a professor at Yale Law School ( as is her husband ) , lives in a culture in which a child ’ s self-esteem is considered so fragile that children ’ s sports teams give “ Most Valuable Player ” awards to every member . so it is not surprising that many Americans react with horror to her style of parenting .
one problem in assessing the tiger-mothering approach is that we can ’ t separate its impact from that of the genes that the parents pass on to their children . if you want your children to be at the top of their class , it helps if you and your partner have the brains to become professors at elite universities .
Tiger parenting aims at getting children to make the most of what abilities they have , and so seems to lean towards the “ clever ” side of the “ clever or happy ” choice . that ’ s also the view of Betty Ming Liu , who blogged in response to Chua ’ s article : “ Parents like Amy Chua are the reason why Asian-Americans like me are in therapy . ”
Stanley Sue , a professor of psychology at the University of California , Davis , has studied suicide , which is particularly common among Asian-American women ( in other ethnic groups , more males commit suicide than females ) . he believes that family pressure is a significant factor .
Chua would reply that reaching a high level of achievement brings great satisfaction , and that the only way to do it is through hard work . perhaps , but can ’ t children be encouraged to do things because they are intrinsically worthwhile , rather than because of fear of parental disapproval ?
one of them let her daughter drop out of three different kindergartens , because she didn ’ t want to go to them . another couple believes in “ self-directed learning ” to such an extent that one evening they went to bed at 11 p.m. , leaving their five-year-old watching her ninth straight hour of Barbie videos .
Tiger mothering might seem to be a useful counterbalance to such permissiveness , but both extremes leave something out . Chua ’ s focus is unrelentingly on solitary activities in the home , with no encouragement of group activities , or of concern for others , either in school or in the wider community .
if talented children stay away , the quality of the production will suffer , to the detriment of the others who take part ( and of the audience that will watch it ) . and all children whose parents bar them from such activities miss the opportunity to develop social skills that are just as important and rewarding – and just as demanding to master – as those that monopolize Chua ’ s attention .
we should aim for our children to be good people , and to live ethical lives that manifest concern for others as well as for themselves . this approach to child-rearing is not unrelated to happiness : there is abundant evidence that those who are generous and kind are more content with their lives than those who are not .
so are elephants , and elephant mothers do not focus only on the well-being of their own offspring . together , they protect and take care of all the young in their herd , running a kind of daycare center .
if we all think only of our own interests , we are headed for collective disaster – just look at what we are doing to our planet ’ s climate . when it comes to raising our children , we need fewer tigers and more elephants .
time for America to Turn South
whatever John Kerry does about Latin America if he is elected President of the United States in November , the election could initiate a sea-change in US-Latin American relations - even or perhaps mainly if George W. Bush is reelected . Kerry has never shown much interest in the region , while Bush has largely ignored it since the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
poll after poll shows that Latins feel more negatively about the US than at any time since the 1960 &apos;s . in contrast to that era , popular hostility is not really motivated by US actions in or toward Latin America ; but today &apos;s anti-Americanism still complicates life greatly for democratic leaders in the hemisphere , and for America itself .
second , and more importantly , the substantive issues of conflict on the US-Latin American agenda are heating up . they will not go away by themselves , and failure to address them will probably only make them worse .
first and foremost is economic growth , which for the past few years - indeed , for the past two decades - has been dismal . in countries where trade and investment is concentrated in ties with the US , this is a central issue in the bilateral relationship .
the US has a much larger role to play than simply promoting trade liberalization in the region . the US must help these countries build up their infrastructure , educational and legal systems , competitiveness , and transparency .
why should the US bother ? why should it care whether Latin American countries closely linked to it by trade , investment , tourism , and retirees do better or worse , grow or stagnate , become more competitive or lose ground globally ?
first , and perhaps least self-evident , is energy . countries like Mexico , Venezuela , and Colombia supply up to 40 % of US oil imports , and could easily replace unstable suppliers in the Middle East .
cooperation on security matters is desirable for America , and indispensable for the countries of the region . the consequences of a new terrorist outrage originating from any nation south of the US-Mexican border would be devastating for that country , let alone for the victims of such an attack .
traditionally a Mexican , Central American , and Caribbean matter , it has now reached Brazil , Colombia , Venezuela , Ecuador , and beyond . every flight from Sao Paulo to Mexico City carries dozens of low-income Brazilians , who have already paid their pollero , or &quot; people-smuggler , &quot; to route them on from the Mexican capital to the northern border .
the New York Times recently published an exceptional description of Ecuadorian polleros transporting their human cargo to the coasts of Guatemala and then onward through Mexico to the US . Colombian displaced persons and Venezuela &apos;s middle class are fleeing to Miami .
last year , I visited the main jumping-off point on the US-Mexican border : El Sasabe on the Sonora-Arizona border . in the month of May , before the summer &apos;s searing and deadly heat , local authorities estimated a daily average of 1,000 migrants attempting to cross .
America cannot stem this tide by closing its borders ; but it can regulate the tide by legalizing and humanizing it , and by helping to create conditions in Latin America where life-threatening emigration is not the only way out . a first-term Kerry administration or a second-term Bush presidency must make this a high foreign policy priority .
all of these issues are crucial to the US : jobs , immigration , security , energy . but Latin America is deeply troubled ; it needs decisive , bold leadership at home and imaginative , unwavering support abroad .
time for China to Float
China is being pressured to halt its interventions to prop up the US dollar in world currency markets , with opponents emphasizing how much harm the policy is causing to other countries . but China ’ s authorities might respond more favorably to an argument that points out how China ’ s own economic health might benefit from abandoning the current exchange-rate policy , which pegs the yuan to the dollar .
China is currently pursuing a contradictory set of policies that paradoxically undermines its own economy while propping up America ’ s by accommodating pump-priming by the Federal Reserve . China and Hong Kong are the largest net purchasers of US Treasury securities .
back in China , the dollar peg has led to large and growing foreign-exchange reserves , which are fueling domestic inflationary pressures and causing public-sector debt to balloon . this is because official capital controls oblige exporters to deposit hard currencies with the People ’ s Bank of China in exchange for freshly printed yuan ( usually as bank deposits ) or government debt .
there is a great deal of volatility in foreign-exchange markets across the globe , mainly owing to the weakening of the dollar . as such , China and other countries are holding a depreciating asset that should be managed to serve domestic interests rather than those of the US .
Chinese policymakers should bear in mind that the value of the yuan is only one among many factors that affects the competitiveness of China ’ s economy . after all , a currency can appreciate while an economy is sluggish , or depreciate despite robust growth .
for a given supply of money , an increase in the production of goods will increase the value of a currency , because each unit will buy more goods . likewise , increasing the supply of money relative to a fixed amount of output will lead to a decline in the purchasing power of money , as each currency unit buys fewer goods .
given the high rate of growth in China ’ s money supply , there could be considerable pressures for the yuan to actually depreciate , because a rate of monetary growth that exceeds the growth rate of economic activity tends to cause a currency ’ s exchange rate to fall . if exchange rates were fixed but capital could move freely , capital flight from the country would generate pressures to end loose monetary policies .
but such an insignificant rate hike will do little to relieve long-term pressures , because investors will expect more rate hikes and move money into China , increasing upward pressure on the yuan ’ s exchange rate . indeed , the logic is self-fulfilling : as more foreign currency flows into the market , the economy will continue to overheat , necessitating further interest rate hikes .
meanwhile , the dollar ’ s falling value reflects the fact that the Fed is pumping more money into the system than are most of its trading partners . so , the dollar will continue to weaken until the rate of increase in new money into the US economy no longer exceeds that of domestic economic growth and corresponds to the pace of monetary expansion followed by central banks in the rest of the world .
China ’ s effort to hold down the value of the yuan vis-à-vis the dollar is thus a costly and pointless policy . by delaying a decision to float the yuan , the authorities are merely contributing to greater instability in the Chinese economy .
it ’ s Time to Ban the Bomb
Stockholm – The nuclear agreement between Iran , the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany , and the EU , comes at a historically propitious moment . Seventy years ago next month , the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki opened the darkest chapter in the long history of humanity ’ s wartime horrors .
after World War I , the international community adopted the so-called Gas Protocol , to prohibit the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons . likewise , the demand to ban any use of nuclear weapons has been strong and persistent since the end of World War II .
but the states possessing nuclear weapons have always opposed such a ban , arguing that it would not be credible . instead , they have recommended a step-by-step approach , eventually leading to a ban on the possession and production of nuclear weapons .
during the Cold War , the total number of nuclear weapons worldwide climbed to more than 50,000 . many , including hydrogen bombs , had explosive yields that were orders of magnitude higher than the bombs dropped on Japan .
to be sure , the first part of the NPT has had some success : since the treaty entered into force , only four states – India , Israel , North Korea , and Pakistan – have developed nuclear weapons . South Africa eliminated its nuclear weapons and became a party to the NPT , while Ukraine , Belarus , and Kazakhstan transferred their nuclear arsenals to Russia .
nuclear stockpiles were reduced – mainly for economic reasons – following the Cold War , to less than 20,000 nuclear weapons worldwide ( still enough to destroy humanity several times over ) . and the 2010 New START agreement brought welcome upper limits to the number of nuclear weapons deployed by the US and Russia .
moreover , it was once hoped that NATO ’ s small number of non-strategic nuclear weapons sited in Europe could be withdrawn to the US , as they were widely considered militarily useless . doing so , it was suggested , could lead Russia to remove its own tactical nuclear weapons .
a moratorium on such tests exists , and an impressive monitoring machinery has been created , able to register not only weapons tests , but also earthquakes and tsunamis . yet , because eight countries , including the US and China , have failed to ratify it , the CTBT occupies a legal netherworld : it may be said to be in operation , but not in force .
there is little hope of any change for the better unless the Security Council ’ s permanent members conclude that their own security requires resuming détente among themselves and launching serious disarmament negotiations , as promised . they have shown their willingness to act to restrain other states from acquiring weapons of mass destruction ; now it is time for them to restrain themselves .
of course , just as some states refuse to join the conventions that ban cluster bombs and landmines , the nuclear-weapon states will not join a convention banning their arsenals . yet the existence of such a treaty could serve as a constant reminder of what is expected of them .
today , more people may worry that humanity will suffer a more prolonged death through global warming . but the nuclear peril is still there , and groups like Global Zero deserve our support in their efforts to raise public awareness .
it has been said that Hiroshima and Nagasaki created a taboo against any further use of nuclear weapons . let us hope so , but let us also demand that the taboo be made legally binding .
time to Bring Mahatma Gandhi Back
many believe that Congress – with its commitment to secular values , economic growth , and helping the poor – now has a mandate to transform India into a great power . business and financial interests , in particular , are delighted with the outcome , crowing about the bonanza about to be unleashed as Congress liberalizes India ’ s economy further .
the Americans are happy that India ’ s pesky left , reduced to a paltry 24 seats , has been all but eliminated from national government . India ’ s Communists had tried to topple the Congress-led government last year in an attempt to scuttle the nuclear deal brokered by the United States , and had vowed to upend it .
as for the threat from the right , anyone hoping for peace in the region and reduced tensions within India between religious communities is relieved by the defeat of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) . the BJP ’ s strategy of painting the Congress as soft on terror and demonizing Muslims as an existential threat to India badly misfired .
unfortunately , however , the economic trajectory that Congress is plotting , though it may well boost growth in the short term , is ultimately on a collision course with both equity and sustainability . despite rhetoric about “ inclusive growth , ” India ’ s wealth gap has widened during the years of exceptionally rapid economic expansion .
while private wealth management is a growth industry among India ’ s 200,000 or so nouveaux riches , 800 million Indians live on less than $ 2 per day . India ’ s water supply is stretched to the limit , even as global warming is fast melting the Himalayan glaciers on which millions depend for water .
company projects India ’ s middle-class consumer market will have hit 600 million people , twice the size of the current US population . that ’ s exciting news to retailers looking for new markets .
for Gandhi , the spinning wheel symbolized the need to assume personal responsibility for consumption as a first step toward achieving justice and freedom for all . but Jawaharlal Nehru , India ’ s first prime minister , believed in industrialization and urbanization , famously calling the new mega-dam projects his government underwrote the “ temples of modern India . ”
as Congress retakes power , it is Rahul Gandhi , the 39-year-old great-grandson of the man who made that promise , who is the heir-apparent to current Prime Minister Manmohan Singh . observers expect the young Gandhi to become prime minister within two years .
the essential challenge before him and his country is not transitioning from a more to a less state-directed economic system , as many of those cheering Congress ’ s electoral victory believe . while bureaucratic excess , entrenched corruption , and other inefficiencies beg remedy , the real challenge before India is its allegiance to a twentieth-century vision of modernity .
former Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram has said that his dream is to see 85 % of Indians living in cities and only 15 % , as opposed to the current 60 % , engaged in agriculture , because to be an agrarian society in the modern era is to be poor and powerless . to be “ developed ” means to be industrialized and urbanized .
for Gandhi , greed led to violence , violence to militarism , militarism to war , and war to annihilation . his philosophy of non-violence was aimed at the most basic form of human aggression : the appetite for more than one ’ s share .
if India is lucky , when he assumes leadership of the Congress Party he will let himself be as inspired by Mahatma Gandhi ’ s vision for India as by that of his great-grandfather . after all , it was out of their complicated marriage of ideas that independent India was born .
starving the Squid
Berkeley – Is America ’ s financial sector slowly draining the lifeblood from its real economy ? the journalist Matt Taibbi ’ s memorable description in 2009 of Goldman Sachs – “ a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity , relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money ” – still resonates , and for good reason .
such a massive diversion of resources “ away from goods and services directly useful this year , ” I argued , “ is a good bargain only if it boosts overall annual economic growth by 0.3 % – or 6 % per 25-year generation . ” In other words , it is a good bargain only if it collectively has a substantial amount of what financiers call “ alpha . ”
over the past year and a half , in the wake of Thomas Philippon and Ariell Reshef ’ s estimate that 2 % of US GDP has been wasted in the pointless hypertrophy of the financial sector , evidence that America ’ s financial system is less a device for efficiently sharing risk and more a device for separating rich people from their money – a Las Vegas without the glitz – has mounted .
this is not a partisan view . Bruce Bartlett , a senior official in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations , recently pointed to research showing the sharp rise in the financialization of the US economy .
it seemed to me that , yes , our modern sophisticated financial systems had created enormous macroeconomic risks . but it also seemed to me that a world short of risk-bearing capacity needed virtually anything that induced people to commit their money to long-term risky investments .
in other words , such a world needed either the reality or the illusion that finance could , as John Maynard Keynes put it , “ defeat the dark forces of time and ignorance which envelop our future . ” Most reforms that would guard against macroeconomic risk would also limit the ability of finance to persuade people to commit to long-term risky investments , and hence further lower the supply of finance willing to assume such undertakings .
first , modern finance is simply too politically powerful for legislatures or regulators to restrain its ability to create systemic macroeconomic risk . at the same time , it has not preserved its ability to entice customers with promises of safe , sophisticated money management .
second , the correlations between economic growth and financial deepening on which I relied do indeed vanish when countries ’ financial systems move beyond banks , electronic funds transfer , and bond markets to more sophisticated instruments .
finally , the social returns from investment in finance as the industry of the future have largely disappeared over the past generation . a back-of-the-envelope calculation of mine in 2007 suggested that the world paid financial institutions roughly $ 800 billion every year for mergers and acquisitions that yielded about $ 170 billion of real economic value .
time to Nationalize Insolvent Banks
new YORK – A year ago , I predicted that the losses of US financial institutions would reach at least $ 1 trillion and possibly go as high as $ 2 trillion . at that time , the consensus among economists and policymakers was that these estimates were exaggerated , because it was believed that sub-prime mortgage losses totaled only about $ 200 billion .
indeed , since then , the write-downs by US banks have already passed the $ 1 trillion mark ( my floor estimate of losses ) , and institutions such as the IMF and Goldman Sachs now predict losses of more than $ 2 trillion .
but if you think that the $ 2 trillion figure is already huge , the latest estimates by my research consultancy RGE Monitor suggest that total losses on loans made by US financial firms and the fall in the market value of the assets they hold ( things like mortgage-backed securities ) will peak at about $ 3.6 trillion .
US banks and broker dealers are exposed to about half of this figure , or $ 1.8 trillion ; the rest is borne by other financial institutions in the US and abroad . the capital backing the banks ’ assets was only $ 1.4 trillion last fall , leaving the US banking system some $ 400 billion in the hole , or close to zero even after the government and private-sector recapitalization of such banks .
another $ 1.5 trillion is needed to bring banks ’ capital back to pre-crisis level , which is needed to resolve the credit crunch and restore lending to the private sector . so , the US banking system is effectively insolvent in the aggregate ; most of the British banking system looks insolvent , too , as do many continental European banks .
in the “ bad bank ” model , the government may overpay for the bad assets , whose true value is uncertain . even in the guarantee model there can be such implicit government over-payment ( or an over-guarantee that is not properly priced by the fees that the government receives ) .
in the “ bad bank ” model , the government has the additional problem of managing all the bad assets that it purchased – a task for which it lacks expertise . and the very cumbersome US Treasury proposal – which combines removing toxic assets from banks ’ balance sheets while providing government guarantees – was so non-transparent and complicated that the markets dove as soon as it was announced .
nationalization also resolves the too-big-too-fail problem of banks that are systemically important , and that thus need to be rescued by the government at a high cost to taxpayers . indeed , the problem has now grown larger , because the current approach has led weak banks to take over even weaker banks .
Bank of America ’ s takeover of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch ; and Wells Fargo ’ s takeover of Wachovia underscore the problem . with nationalization , the government can break up these financial monstrosities and sell them to private investors as smaller good banks .
whereas Sweden adopted this approach successfully during its banking crisis in the early 1990 ’ s , the current US and British approach may end up producing Japanese-style zombie banks – never properly restructured and perpetuating a credit freeze . Japan suffered a decade-long near-depression because of its failure to clean up the banks .
time to Talk with Iran
for Europeans , the NIE has not removed , but rather confirmed , the concerns that in 2003 prompted the EU-3 ( Britain , France , and Germany ) – namely , that Iran ’ s nuclear program could eventually give it a military nuclear capability , and that even before that point , it might trigger regional nuclear proliferation .
second , it should clearly communicate that the issue is proliferation , not the nature of the Iranian regime . third , any further sanctions should be accompanied by an earnest offer of dialogue and engagement .
by contrast , some American policymakers continue to believe that Iran would abandon its enrichment program if only the European Union imposed unilateral sanctions . but a clear-headed analysis of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’ s behavior indicates that EU sanctions would lead to more trade diversion , with China , Russia , Turkey , or Dubai benefiting from reduced levels of European exports to Iran .
of course , some imports would become more expensive for Iran , but the economic effect of such sanctions would remain limited . politically , Ahmadinejad certainly would not miss the chance to exploit unilateral measures for propaganda purposes – claiming that Iran has a conflict not with the international community , but with imperialist states intent on depriving his country of technological progress .
for these reasons , Europeans favor a new Security Council resolution , even if its measures are weaker than what the United States or the EU could impose unilaterally . such a resolution would send an effective signal to the Iranian public and political elite that Iran is in conflict with the entire international community .
Iranians do not like to be isolated ; even the clerical elite has a strong interest in exchanges with the rest of the world , and they like to send their children to Western schools . making it obvious that it is Ahmadinejad ’ s policies that are isolating Iran would strengthen the still-fragile anti-Ahmadinejad alliance of pragmatic conservatives and reformers , which has lately become more vocal .
the election will not be entirely free , but the government will be unable to manipulate them entirely . the majlis plays a role in the political process , to the point of being able to induce or hinder policy changes : witness the way a conservative majlis blocked reformist President Mohammad Khatami in the last years of his term .
Europeans should now be confident enough to call for a common policy with the US that focuses on domestic developments in Iran . such a policy can include additional Security Council sanctions , but it must also carry an offer of dialogue that pragmatic forces in Iran would not refuse .
so far , the two governments have communicated either through the EU or on strictly limited issues through their ambassadors in Baghdad . the US has so far insisted that it will agree to a comprehensive dialogue only if Iran first suspends its enrichment activities .
the best method of strengthening Ahmadinejad , however , appears to be to threaten the country and the regime as a whole . an honest offer of engagement would allow Ahmadinejad ’ s pragmatic opponents to show that it is Iran ’ s president and his controversial policies , not the West , that are at fault .
Tobin Trouble
Cambridge – European leaders are seriously considering a Tobin tax , which would put a small levy on financial transactions , thereby dampening trading . but will the tax do as much as its proponents hope ?
it taxes liquidity , which many believe is overly abundant . it encourages fundamental analysis of a company ’ s operations , and some advocates hope that a Tobin tax would push firms themselves to focus even more on long-term value .
moreover , a Tobin tax moves financial traders – talented people with strong work habits – into other activities , which ( policymakers hope ) will benefit the economy more . and , if financial innovations like derivatives and short-term repurchase agreements have made markets more volatile and fragile , a Tobin tax could help to stabilize and strengthen them .
in fact , to the extent that dampened trading diminishes market feedback to firms and their directors , it could make managers complacent . traders might stop trading , but shareholders still might not conduct more fundamental , long-term analysis : the rise of index funds , which hold a broadly-diversified swath of the entire stock market , reflects this trend toward stockholder passivity .
lowering volatility and sopping up excess liquidity can be beneficial , but there are risks here as well : regulators can easily overshoot the mark , leaving financial markets with weakened capacity for price discovery and too little liquidity .
that leaves the hope that a Tobin tax would induce high-IQ financial traders to do something else , with higher net benefits to society . if trading today is not helping to move capital to its highest and best use , reallocating inefficiently employed financial talent could yield big benefits .
the financial crisis erupted in 2008 when mortgage-backed securities were revalued at much less than what they had been thought to be worth . the problem was not that these securities were ferociously traded ( most were not , and thus were not the kind of security that a Tobin tax would hit hard ) , but rather that everyone in financial markets revalued them at the same time .
still , in one area , a Tobin tax could provide an unmitigated benefit . many of the largest , most precarious financial institutions now finance themselves via repo : they buy a long-term security ( often government debt ) and sell it , promising to buy it back the next day for a slightly higher price .
dampening the repo market could be economically useful , because this funding has proven to be unstable : bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers used repo heavily in ways that made them unable to withstand investment reversals elsewhere in their business . the same was true of MF Holdings last fall .
to be sure , markets might move those transactions from France and from French financial institutions , and , if the regulators erred – because the business was profitable and not destabilizing – French institutions would lose out . but , if the regulators were right , the French institutions would be more stable .
overall , there is not much to be said against the tax ( other than what is said against all taxes ) , and something to be said for it . but it does not help to solve major financial problems , and those that it does address ( short-term , overnight financing ) could be dealt with more directly , with a more focused tax , better rules governing those transactions , and improved prudential regulation .
as of now , Europe ’ s Tobin tax proposals are not well targeted . sound transactions would be taxed along with destabilizing , overnight financing of fragile financial institutions .
a Tobin tax does , however , allow elected politicians to look like they are doing something useful – which they are , but without addressing more serious economic problems .
South Africa ’ s Winnable AIDS Battle
until recently , the government ’ s response to the epidemic , which threatened the country ’ s very lifeblood , was lackluster and foolish . but rising pressure over the past two decades – from civil-society groups , the media , and more enlightened politicians – is finally showing results .
HIV / AIDS patients are also prone to other infections : an estimated 70 % of South Africans with AIDS also contract tuberculosis , while half of those carrying the HIV virus are expected to do so during their lifetime . worse , a third of pregnant women – a highly AIDS-prone demographic – have been diagnosed with the virus , which can be passed on to their babies during childbirth .
but , during the 1990 ’ s , and for reasons that are still not fully understood , the virus exploded into the general population . the number of infected South Africans ( equivalent to the population of Denmark ) outstrips that of neighboring Mozambique , Lesotho , Botswana , Namibia , Swaziland , and Zimbabwe combined .
yet , incredibly , the rapid spread of HIV and the rising toll of AIDS-related deaths failed to galvanize the country ’ s post-apartheid leaders , especially former President Thabo Mbeki , into meaningful action . for years , the top ranks of the governing Africa National Congress seemed to be in denial over the pervasiveness of HIV / AIDS and how best to combat it .
although contradictory views about how to treat HIV persisted , at least antiretroviral therapy has been available in some public facilities over the past decade . but a more coherent and consistent approach evolved following the appointment of Aaron Motsoaledi as Minister of Health in 2009 .
the South African National Department of Health and private health-care providers now report that conditions are no longer so desperate . three approaches have helped to contain the spread : the provision of antiretroviral therapy by the government and donor agencies ; better treatment of tuberculosis patients , who tend to contract HIV / AIDS as well ; and a greatly expanded program to prevent mother-to-child transmission .
with almost two million patients now on antiretroviral treatment , annual AIDS-related deaths have fallen by around 100,000 since 2005 . contagion among newborn babies , once running at around 70,000 per year , have been cut by some 63 % , and the lives of millions of HIV / AIDS sufferers have been prolonged .
the government has aligned its early antiretroviral treatment programs for existing sufferers , initiated in 2008 , with early monitoring programs for pregnant women . new , more effective treatment to prevent tuberculosis , especially the multidrug-resistant strains , has also helped .
more can and must be done . newborn infections , for example , could be further reduced by encouraging more pregnant mothers to visit health clinics for early monitoring and for checkups after delivery .
the recent successes demonstrate that with political will and sufficient resources , even the greatest of scourges can be beaten – a lesson not only for South Africa but also for countries elsewhere in Africa and the developing world .
Tocqueville ’ s Lessons in Democracy
it seems appropriate that , due to the Iraq war , the world has been debating the nature of democracy 200 years after Alexis de Tocqueville ’ s birth . Tocqueville is justly famous for rejecting reactionary nostalgia and regarding democracy ’ s triumph as our destiny , while warning against the dangers that democracy holds for liberty .
Tocqueville viewed democracy not only as a political regime , but , above all , as an intellectual regime that shapes a society ’ s customs in general , thereby giving it a sociological and psychological dimension . democratic regimes , Tocqueville argued , determine our thoughts , desires , and passions .
they could only pretend to judge events and values on their own ; in reality , they would merely copy the rough and simplified opinions of the masses . indeed , what Tocqueville called the hold of “ social power ” on opinion is probably strongest in democratic regimes – a view that foretells the growth of modern-day demagogy and media manipulation .
schools have the power to be little more than enclaves from the corrosive strength of social influences on how the mind works . similarly , while Tocqueville thought that pursuing virtue as the ancients did , or having a religious faith , could sometimes elevate the soul , both conflict with the democratic ideal if they become officially prescribed in public life .
in this sense , Tocqueville ’ s intellectual heirs include the neo-Marxist theorists of the Frankfurt School , as well as Hannah Arendt , all of whom feared above all the disintegration of reason in modern societies . indeed , the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet entitled a recent book Democracy Against Itself .
but , while history is replete with murderous regimes applauded by cowed and deceived masses , the greater risk for democratic nations is that their citizens withdraw into apathy and short-term thinking for immediate gratification . the past – despite rituals that seek to commemorate historic moments – is obliterated by an addiction to the now and the new .
do the defects of democracy really mean , as Tocqueville claimed , that resigned pessimism is the only – realistic but unsustainable – path open to us ? I don ’ t think so .
the first defense is to push for an educational system that really forms critical minds , namely through the ( nowadays ) largely neglected subjects of literature , history , and philosophy . if the informed and critical citizenry that democracy requires is to be formed , our schools must stop pandering to the latest popular fads and begin to sharpen the analytical capacities of students .
the passivity that mass media encourages is the polar opposite of the active engagement that democratic citizens need . but it is hard to imagine that the mass media ( other than quality newspapers ) would , of their own volition , become instruments of an education that enhances citizens ’ critical capacities .
the question is not one of popularity alone – after all , Mozart was popular in his day , and Shakespeare ’ s plays attracted the poor as well as the rich – but of mass culture ’ s refusal to challenge and provoke . the result of the failure is a generalized indifference and passivity in audiences .
indeed , for a long time a globalized media culture , one unable to inspire the capacity for critical thought or create elevated feelings , has been on the rise . it is a culture that , through its carelessness , threatens democratic freedom because it fails to create any sense of obligation – to society , to history , to community .
Tocqueville despised the elites of his time for their complacency in the face of the deracinating force of mass democracy . will the myopia of our leaders also serve as an agent of his disquieting prophecy ?
to Cure the Economy
new YORK – As the economic slump that began in 2007 persists , the question on everyone ’ s minds is obvious : why ? unless we have a better understanding of the causes of the crisis , we can ’ t implement an effective recovery strategy .
stimulus programs were sold as being a temporary palliative , needed to bridge the gap until the financial sector recovered and private lending resumed . but , while bank profitability and bonuses have returned , lending has not recovered , despite record-low long- and short-term interest rates .
after all , large enterprises are sitting on a few trillion dollars in cash , so money is not what is holding them back from investing and hiring . some , perhaps many , small businesses are , however , in a very different position ; strapped for funds , they can ’ t grow , and many are being forced to contract .
still , overall , business investment – excluding construction – has returned to 10 % of GDP ( from 10.6 % before the crisis ) . with so much excess capacity in real estate , confidence will not recover to its pre-crisis level anytime soon , regardless of what is done to the banking sector .
the financial sector ’ s inexcusable recklessness , given free rein by mindless deregulation , was the obvious precipitating factor of the crisis . the legacy of excess real-estate capacity and over-leveraged households makes recovery all the more difficult .
instead , the personal saving rate plunged to 1 % , and the bottom 80 % of Americans were spending , every year , roughly 110 % of their income . even if the financial sector were fully repaired , and even if these profligate Americans hadn ’ t learned a lesson about the importance of saving , their consumption would be limited to 100 % of their income .
fixing the financial sector was necessary for economic recovery , but far from sufficient . to understand what needs to be done , we have to understand the economy ’ s problems before the crisis hit .
first , America and the world were victims of their own success . rapid productivity increases in manufacturing had outpaced growth in demand , which meant that manufacturing employment decreased .
the problem is analogous to that which arose at the beginning of the twentieth century , when rapid productivity growth in agriculture forced labor to move from rural areas to urban manufacturing centers . with a decline in farm income in excess of 50 % from 1929 to 1932 , one might have anticipated massive migration .
for America and Europe , the need for labor to move out of manufacturing is compounded by shifting comparative advantage : not only is the total number of manufacturing jobs limited globally , but a smaller share of those jobs will be local .
shifting income from those who would spend it to those who won ’ t lowers aggregate demand . by the same token , soaring energy prices shifted purchasing power from the United States and Europe to oil exporters , who , recognizing the volatility of energy prices , rightly saved much of this income .
the final problem contributing to weakness in global aggregate demand was emerging markets ’ massive buildup of foreign-exchange reserves – partly motivated by the mismanagement of the 1997-98 East Asia crisis by the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury . countries recognized that without reserves , they risked losing their economic sovereignty .
where are we today in addressing these underlying problems ? to take the last one first , those countries that built up large reserves were able to weather the economic crisis better , so the incentive to accumulate reserves is even stronger .
with oil prices back above $ 100 a barrel this summer – and still high – money is once again being transferred to the oil-exporting countries . and the structural transformation of the advanced economies , implied by the need to move labor out of traditional manufacturing branches , is occurring very slowly .
government plays a central role in financing the services that people want , like education and health care . and government-financed education and training , in particular , will be critical in restoring competitiveness in Europe and the US .
the prescription for what ails the global economy follows directly from the diagnosis : strong government expenditures , aimed at facilitating restructuring , promoting energy conservation , and reducing inequality , and a reform of the global financial system that creates an alternative to the buildup of reserves .
eventually , the world ’ s leaders – and the voters who elect them – will come to recognize this . as growth prospects continue to weaken , they will have no choice .
today ’ s Counter-Enlightenment
a process that had begun with the Enlightenment had now reached the point at which “ anything goes . ” Particularly in the arts , there were no apparent limits to showing what even a generation ago would have been regarded as highly offensive .
two generations ago , most countries had censors who not only tried to prevent younger people from seeing certain films but who actually banned books . since the 1960 ’ s , such proscriptions have weakened until , in the end , explicit sexuality , violence , blasphemy – while upsetting to some people – were tolerated as a part of the enlightened world .
the denial of a well-documented truth may lead to new crimes . but is the answer to the old question , “ What is truth ? ” always so clear ?
what exactly are we doing if we insist on Turkey ’ s acknowledgement that the Armenian genocide did take place as a condition of its membership in the European Union ? are we so sure of Darwin ’ s theories of evolution that we should ban alternative notions of genesis from schools ?
one such limit is the incitement to violence . the man who gets up in a crowded theater and shouts , “ Fire ! ” when there is none is guilty of what happens in the resulting stampede .
there are questions here that are not easily answered by civilized defenders of the Enlightenment . toleration and respect for people who have their own beliefs are right and perhaps necessary to preserve an enlightened world .
this means that we have to defend Salman Rushdie and the Danish cartoonists and the friends of Idomeneo , whether we like them or not . if anyone does not like them , there are all the instruments of public debate and of critical discourse that an enlightened community has at its disposal .
the kind of reaction we have seen recently to expressions of views that are offensive to some does not bode well for the future of liberty . it is as if a new wave of counter-enlightenment is sweeping the world , with the most restrictive views dominating the scene .
whether an editor publishes cartoons offensive to believers in Muhammad ( or Christ , for that matter ) is a matter of judgment , almost of taste . I might not do it , but I would nevertheless defend the right of someone who decides otherwise .
to Err is Science
but nowadays discovery is almost too easy . anyone with a little funding and a few biological specimens in a refrigerator can make thousands of postulated “ discoveries . ”
indeed , the number of research questions that we can pose is increasing exponentially . medical kits the size of a thumbnail can measure a million different biological factors on an individual with an infinitesimal amount of blood .
moreover , all the teams should agree not to select and report only the data that seem most impressive . with selective reporting , we would end up with a long list of all the false discoveries made across all research teams , with only a few true findings buried among this pile of non-replicated waste .
in a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association published in July 2005 , I showed that refutation is very common , even for the most prestigious research findings . I examined the 45 clinical research findings that had received the greatest recognition in the scientific world , as documented by the number of times other scientists had cited them over the last 15 years .
even with the most robust types of research – for example , randomized clinical trials – one of four of these results had already been found to be wrong or potentially exaggerated within a few years after publication . for epidemiology ( e.g. studies on vitamins , diet , or hormones in terms of their association with health outcomes in the general population ) , four-fifths of the most prestigious findings were rapidly contradicted .
it is to be expected that the majority of research findings are rapidly contradicted and refuted ; indeed , it is part of how progress of science occurs . however , we need to adapt to this situation .
but we should get used to understanding that some research findings have very low credibility , while others may be more likely to stand the test of time . scientists themselves may be able to ascribe these levels of credibility to their own work in fairness , if they describe in detail what they set out to do , and how they did it .
it requires a lot of time , continuous effort , uncompromising integrity , appropriate funding and material support , and unwavering commitment . proposed scientific advances require careful validation and replication by independent scientists .
while these principles are probably well known to serious scientists , they are often forgotten when scientific information is disseminated . our society is awash with inflated information , which is inherent to efforts in many human activities – entertainment , law courts , stock markets , politics , and sports , to name but a few – to gain greater public attention in the framework of mass civilization .
but it would be a damaging to expect science to “ show off ” in this way . exaggeration contradicts the key hallmarks of scientific reasoning : critical thinking and careful appraisal of the evidence .
the Nigerian Kidnappers ’ Ideology
but , unfortunately , their case is not an isolated one in Nigeria . indeed , Nigeria ’ s torment is shared by many other African countries , and the motivation behind the kidnapping derives from an ideology that is global .
of course , the hideous and crazed words of the leader of Boko Haram , the group that kidnapped the girls , are representative only of the most extreme fringe of this ideology . but , until we clean the soil in which this poisonous plant takes root , it will continue to blight the life chances of millions of young people around the world – and jeopardize our own security .
Mali , Chad , Niger , the Central African Republic , Somalia , Kenya , and even Ethiopia have all suffered or face acute anxieties about the spread of extremism . many other countries have now identified extremism as their single most important challenge .
governments are often confronting the challenge with courage and determination , and the use of African forces in many countries to try to keep peace is a tribute to that resolve . but the fact is that the problem is continuing to grow .
when I became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1997 , Nigeria served as an example of productive cooperation between Christians and Muslims . the destructive ideology represented by Boko Haram is not part of the country ’ s traditions ; it has been imported .
Nigeria has approximately 168 million people today , with some estimates putting the population at 300 million by 2030 , split roughly equally between Christian and Muslim . without a climate of peaceful coexistence , the consequences for the country – and the world – will be enormous .
poverty and lack of development play a huge part in creating the circumstances in which extremism incubates . but poverty alone does not explain the problem .
the Middle East , as we know , is immersed in a process of revolution and upheaval that has been immensely complicated by Islamism and its extremist offshoots . in Pakistan , more than 50,000 people have lost their lives in the terror attacks of the last decade .
because misrepresentation follows any pronouncement on this question , let me state some things very clearly . this ideology does not represent Islam .
but this ideology is a strain within Islam that represents an organized , substantial , powerful , and funded minority . what might loosely be called Islamism is based on a politicization of religion that is fundamentally incompatible with the modern world , for it assumes that there is one true religion , only one interpretation of that religion , and that this interpretation should prevail and dominate all countries ’ politics , government institutions , and social life .
other groups may not advocate violence ( though sometimes they do ) but still preach a view of the world that is dangerous and hostile to those who disagree . to see what I mean , read the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s statement in 2013 denouncing the UN women ’ s declaration for , among other things , defending women ’ s right to travel or work without their husbands ’ permission .
it is the ideology , not just the acts of extremism , that must be confronted .
my foundation , which provides practical support to help prevent religious prejudice , conflict , and extremism , has been active in Nigeria for several years , bringing together Christian and Muslim clerics to foster mutual understanding . in more than 20 countries worldwide , we have schools programs that connect children of different faiths to learn about each other .
in Sierra Leone , where we are part of the campaign against malaria , we mobilize churches and mosques to work in their local communities and help families use bed nets effectively to protect themselves against a disease that still kills 750,000 pregnant women and children each year in Africa . we have reached two million people in an act of compassion and care , with results that are as remarkable as the interfaith cooperation that produces them .
every year , the West spends billions of dollars on defense relationships and on fighting terrorism . yet the very thing we are fighting is given license to grow in the education systems of many of the countries with which we are engaged – even in our own .
the G-20 should agree that open-minded education that promotes religious tolerance should be a responsibility of all countries . we should insist upon it in our own school systems – and then insist upon it in others ’ systems .
Nigeria ’ s kidnapped girls are victims not just of an act of violence but of a way of thinking . if we can defeat that ideology , we will begin to make progress toward a more secure world .
education is a Security Issue
in September 2000 , the world seemed very different . we were trying to articulate the new security order in the decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall .
Scroll down any day ’ s news summary and you find stories of terrorism and violence perpetrated in the cause of a false view of religion . some of it is committed by non-state actors , and some of it by state actors ; but all of it is committed in the context of division and conflict defined by differences of religious faith .
this is the new struggle of the twenty-first century . we will not win it unless we fight its root causes as well as its ghastly consequences .
today , in an arc that stretches from the Far East through the Middle East to the streets of cities in Europe and the United States , we face a scourge that has taken innocent lives , scarred communities , and destabilized countries . it is a threat that is constantly evolving , growing , and mutating to counter our fight against it .
the extremists propagating this violence have networks of outreach to young people and know the power of education , whether formal or informal . extremists are filling young minds with the belief that anyone who disagrees is an enemy – and not just their enemy , but God ’ s enemy .
the security debate has understandably often focused on the consequences . after an attack , states consider immediate security measures .
and the extremists are good at jumping on the back of political grievances . but the soil in which they plant the seeds of hate is fertilized with ignorance .
that is why we need to start thinking of education as a security issue .
but it also causes a chain reaction of bitterness and hatred . there is real fear in the communities plagued by such extremism , fear that paralyzes normal life and pushes people away from each other .
we are more connected than at any point in human history , and more and more people come into contact with those who are different from them . so the need to respect a neighbor who is not like you is much greater ; but the scope to identify him or her as an enemy is also greater .
and this is not only about Islamic extremism . there are extremist acts perpetrated against Muslims because of their religion , and today there are fanatical Christians , Jews , Hindus , and Buddhists who disfigure the true nature of their faith .
that is why education in the twenty-first century is a security issue for all of us . the challenge is to show young people who are vulnerable to appeals from terrorists that there is a better path to having their voice heard , a more meaningful way to engage with the world .
our schools program promotes cross-cultural dialogue among students aged 12-17 around the world . reaching students in more than 20 countries , our program connects students via a secure Web site , where they interact from their classrooms under the guidance of trained teachers .
through facilitated videoconferences , students discuss global issues from a variety of faith and belief perspectives . they gain the dialogue skills required to prevent conflict by breaking down religious and cultural stereotypes .
but we now have experience in more than a thousand schools ; over 50,000 students have been taught , and we are working in countries as diverse as Pakistan , India , the US , Jordan , Egypt , Canada , Italy , the Philippines , and Indonesia . I have been privileged to witness these students becoming at ease with the cultures , faiths , and beliefs that inspire so many people around the world .
there are many other fantastic examples of this type of work . but they lack the resources , weight , and recognition that they need .
and we need to act globally . all governments must take seriously their responsibility to educate young people to accept and respect people of different faiths and cultures .
there is no issue that is more pressing . there is a real danger that religious conflict replaces the ideologically based struggles of the last century in an equally devastating form .
it is up to all of us to show people that we have a better idea than the extremists have – to learn from each other and live with each other . and this needs to be a core part of young people ’ s education .
Tony Blair ’ s Long Goodbye
in early 1999 , Paddy Ashdown , then the leader of Britain ’ s Liberal Democratic Party ( and since then , as Lord Ashdown , Europe ’ s envoy in Bosnia ) , was found with a woman not his wife and forced to resign his post . in his diaries , he describes calling on Prime Minister Tony Blair to inform him in advance of his intention to quit :
I would rather stop when people said , “ Why is he going ? ” than when they said , “ Why isn ’ t he going ? ” Or , even worse , “ When is he going ? ”
this leaves us with an enduring mystery . Britain ’ s most adept and skillful politician has evidently known for years exactly what not to do about arranging his departure , and yet he has chosen to ignore his own advice .
the mystery deepens when we recall that this consideration has been a part of Blair ’ s calculations ever since he became leader of the Labour Party in 1994 . at a dinner in a London restaurant named Granita , in what has since become the best-known coffee-stage chat in British history , Blair made a proposal to Gordon Brown , his rival for the leadership .
( I readily agreed , since an unanswerable question is a waste of time . ) But no sooner had I asked the Prime Minister how he was than he replied with a grin : “ It ’ s nice to know one doesn ’ t have to fight another election . ”
for the rest of the conversation , and on the trip to the outskirts of London that I also took with him , Blair talked and acted as if he had a full Prime Ministerial agenda on everything from global warming to the reconstruction of Afghanistan . he also behaved , when talking to voters and citizens , as if he was tirelessly running for office for a fourth time .
moreover , next year he will have been Prime Minister for a decade , longer than any previous Labour leader . a little longer , and he would outlast Margaret Thatcher ’ s record-breaking tenure , which must have been a temptation .
but Blair inexplicably chose to compound the mistake he had made with Brown , by announcing publicly , after having defeated the Tories for the third straight time , that he would not stand again . from then on , there was really only one question on peoples ’ minds , and it was the third – the worst – of the three questions he had mentioned to Ashdown : “ When is he going ? ”
and the trade unions , whose power he has done so much to reduce , have been open in saying that they want a new party leader . thus , his announcement that he will leave Downing Street next year is no more than a reluctant acceptance of what has been reality for some time .
in deploying soldiers to Afghanistan and Iraq , he was convinced that he was both morally correct and politically right to stand by Britain ’ s main historic ally , the United States . ( it is reasonably certain that he would not have trusted Brown to do any of these things in the face of any serious opposition , and also reasonably certain that he was correct to think so . )
they may also suggest a slight tendency , on the part of those uttering them , to believe in some kind of supernatural endorsement . so Blair ’ s concession that he must leave office , a decision so long postponed and so disastrously protracted , represents among other things a triumph of the mundane over the permanent temptation to believe that politics is about anything else .
Tony Blair ’ s Palestine
he will need all his skills to address the bewildering range of global tasks that he has taken on since being shoehorned out of office by his dour successor , Gordon Brown . his initial daytime job , after running Britain , was to bring peace to the Middle East by helping establish the governing institutions of a Palestinian state .
since then , Blair has become an adviser to banks ( which need all the advice they can get these days ) , is touring the world to promote a sensible policy on global warming and climate change , has created a foundation to help bridge the divide between different faiths , and will lecture on religion at Yale . all that is left is to restore the fortunes of England ’ s national football and cricket teams .
throughout the long years of this bloody tragedy , we have tried to inch our way to a settlement through confidence-building measures or , in the case of the long dead “ Road Map , ” through pushing both parties to take parallel steps towards an agreement . some observers , not least hard-headed Israeli peace campaigners , have suggested a different approach .
you will never succeed , they say , if you try to bob and weave your way slowly towards an end game . instead , you should jump straight into a final deal .
while Israeli public opinion has usually appeared to run well ahead of its political leaders in the approach to peace , it is difficult to see how one could act over their heads . they need to be pushed and shoved into a successful negotiation .
what would it mean to go straight to Palestinian statehood ?
if you don ’ t believe me , just visit the West Bank and see , for example , how the proposed suburban Israeli development of East Jerusalem stabs through the heart of Palestinian territory towards the Dead Sea . how can you have a viable state carved up by fences , military roads , and barbed wire ?
any Palestinian state should be within the 1967 borders ( as adjusted through negotiation ) . peace activists on both sides solved that in the Geneva initiative .
his greatest achievement was the peace deal in Northern Ireland . that historic triumph depended on bringing in Sinn Fein politicians – leaders of the Irish Republican movement who in many cases could not be distinguished from the IRA , which bombed , shot , and maimed civilians in pursuit of its political goals .
why should what worked in Northern Ireland – indeed , what was pressed on Britain by the United States – be unthinkable in the Middle East ? are we in the West guilty of double standards yet again ?
but since when were sentiment and moral denunciation sufficient ingredients of a policy ? and when did a disproportionate military response to terrorism ever work ?
the third challenge in establishing a Palestinian state is to create the institutions of statehood : hospitals , ports , airports , roads , courts , police stations , tax offices , and government archives . when I was a European Commissioner , we provided funds from European taxpayers to pay for these things .
how did destroying driving licenses in Palestine preserve Israeli security ? how was it preserved by digging up runways , uprooting olive trees , and fouling wells ?
a Palestinian state will need to be built from the bottom up . and what is built should not be destroyed .
I want to see – and I ’ m sure Blair does , too – a peaceful Palestinian state next door to a secure Israel in a region united in prosperity and stability . maybe Blair has hit on how this can be achieved .
Tony Blair ’ s Poisoned Legacy
Tony Blair has a powerful claim to being one of the most successful British politicians of any recent generation , at least in domestic economic and social policy . but history will remember him mainly for his strategic error in going to war in Iraq .
it also established a new tradition of stability in economic policy , continuing and reinforcing the previous Conservative government ’ s commitment to fiscal discipline and low inflation . stable economic policy and rapid growth , in turn , enabled Blair ’ s government to pour extra money into education and the National Health Service .
in short , when Blair took Britain to war , he deliberately misled Parliament and the electorate about the ostensible rationale for it . when no WMD were found , Blair fell back on the previously unavowed justification that the removal of Saddam Hussein was the “ right thing to do . ”
unfortunately , the Bush administration did not foresee that Saddam ’ s removal would precipitate a multi-sided insurgency and civil war . these dangers were predictable , and the world now knows that the war has proved a terrible failure of American strategy , and may yet have even more catastrophic consequences .
so why did Blair support it ? part of the answer goes back to Blair ’ s first big foreign policy adventure , NATO ’ s intervention in Kosovo in 1999 .
diplomatic efforts by the outside world proved ineffective , so in March 1999 , NATO began a 78-day bombing campaign against the Serbs . Blair was at the forefront among Western leaders in pressing for NATO action , and to justify this innovation in outside intervention he proclaimed “ a new doctrine of international community ” that made it a “ just war , ” because it was based on superior Western values .
one of Blair ’ s character flaws is self-righteousness , an excessive confidence – perhaps an extrapolation of his Christian faith – that he knows what is correct , and is therefore entitled to act accordingly . in the case of the Iraq war , Blair has never conceded that the war was mistaken in conception or disastrous in practice : for him , it was still “ the right thing to do . ”
there is no sign of an end to the sectarian violence , and little prospect that Iraq can become a peaceful , unitary democracy . moreover , the convulsions in Iraq may well have incalculable repercussions throughout the Middle East .
one consequence , from a British perspective , is that it is now virtually impossible to imagine that any future prime minister could engage in another big military adventure primarily out of loyalty to an American president . indeed , it is possible that Blair , through his complicity in the Iraq war , has inflicted major damage on the very idea of a “ special relationship ” between Britain and the United States .
it is uncertain whether Tony Blair could have dissuaded George Bush from waging war in Iraq . nevertheless , by enthusiastically backing Bush ’ s war , his legacy will forever remain deeply compromised .
still Too Big to Fail
Washington , DC – Nearly seven years after the global financial crisis erupted , and more than five years after the passage of the Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation in the United States , the cause of the crisis – the existence of banks that are “ too big to fail ” – has yet to be uprooted . as long as that remains the case , another disaster is only a matter of time .
as problems spread throughout the financial system , the US authorities decided that some banks and other financial companies were so large relative to the economy that they were “ systemically important ” and could not be allowed to go bankrupt . Lehman failed , but AIG , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Citigroup , Bank of America , and others were all rescued through various forms of massive – and unprecedented – government support .
the official line at the time was “ never again , ” which made sense in political and economic terms . these large financial firms were provided a scale of assistance that was not generally available to the nonfinancial corporate sector – and certainly not to families who found that the value of their assets ( their homes ) was below the value of their liabilities ( their mortgages ) .
in the jargon of economics , this is “ moral hazard . ” But no special training is needed to know that it is unwise and dangerous when bank executives get the upside ( huge bonuses ) when things go well and everyone else bears the downside risks ( bailouts and recession ) .
the first section of the legislation , Title I , stipulates that all firms must be able to go bankrupt without causing large-scale damage to the broader financial system or the real economy . regulators are instructed , in no uncertain terms , to make sure that all large financial firms are structured in such a way that bankruptcy , using the standard rules and procedures of the court system , can happen without repeating the catastrophic post-Lehman cascade .
in Title II of Dodd-Frank , Congress created a back-up authority through which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) can take over and manage a failing financial firm and impose appropriate losses on shareholders and some creditors without creating widespread systemic damage or a global panic . the good news is that , over the past half-decade , the FDIC has made some progress formulating the design of a workable Title II .
the bad news is that there has been almost no progress in terms of ensuring that large financial firms actually can go bankrupt . in a hearing this week before a part of the Senate Banking Committee , there was complete agreement across the political spectrum on this point .
the Republican proposal is to modify the bankruptcy code , creating special provisions for large , complex financial institutions . there are three problems with this approach .
first , all companies in the US should be able to fail under the same rules . privileged treatment for anyone perpetuates the perception that it is safer to lend to some large financial firms – and further strengthens their unfair advantage .
second , it is fanciful to believe that the private sector would want to get involved in providing funding to a huge financial firm under court supervision , particularly during a systemic crisis . the definition of such a crisis is precisely that moment when private-sector loans are not readily available .
some foreign regulators – such as the Bank of England – have agreed not to act preemptively in a resolution process run by the FDIC . but such agreements do not apply to a court-run bankruptcy process ; authorities everywhere would move to protect local creditors and taxpayers by seizing assets in their jurisdiction .
the only reasonable alternative is to make large , complex financial institutions smaller and less complex so that it is possible for them to fail under standard bankruptcy rules . this is the intent of Dodd-Frank .
the FDIC has pushed hard in this direction , whereas the Federal Reserve Board of Governors has been less enthusiastic . but the law is the law , and it is time to implement it .
too Big to Jail
Washington , DC – Among the fundamental principles of any functioning justice system is the following : don ’ t lie to a judge or falsify documents submitted to a court , or you will go to jail . breaking an oath to tell the truth is perjury , and lying in official documents is both perjury and fraud .
as Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets has argued , the recent so-called “ robo-signing ” settlement – in which five large banks “ settled ” their legal liability for carrying out fraudulent foreclosures on mortgages – is a complete sell-out to the financial industry .
first , there was no serious criminal prosecution – meaning that no one will be charged with a felony , and no one will go to jail . in terms of affecting executives ’ incentives , this is the only thing that matters .
Kelleher , an attorney with extensive experience in private practice and the public sector , tells it like it is : “ ‘ robo-signing ’ is massive , systematic , fraudulent , criminal conduct . ” Alternatively , as he points out , we could just call it “ lying , cheating , and stealing . ”
second , the civil penalties in this settlement – a form of fine – are minuscule relative to the size of the companies involved . as Shahien Nasiripour , one of the best reporters on this issue , dryly put it : “ None of the five lenders have said they expect to incur a material charge due to the settlement . ”
third , such fines are , in any case , paid by the companies ’ shareholders , not by their executives or board members ( all of whom carry insurance ) . in the rare cases in which fines have been levied on individuals , either their insurance policies picked up most of the bill , or the penalties were trivial relative to the cash compensation that they received while committing their crimes – or both .
as if all of this weren ’ t bad enough , the banks reportedly will be able to use government money to write down the value of mortgages , which amounts to subsidizing them to pay their own meaningless fines .
as Kelleher points out , the United States has “ more than 10 million homes under water ” ( the outstanding mortgage exceeds the house ’ s value ) . “ Twenty billion dollars doesn ’ t make a dent in that : one million homes at $ 20,000 loan forgiveness is it . ”
in fact , the Obama administration ’ s settlement with the mortgage lenders is consistent with its track record on all of its policies related to the financial sector , which has been abysmal . but it is also puzzling .
I honestly do not believe that the administration ’ s stance reflects any form of corruption – payments made to individuals or even to political campaigns . and , in this case , it does not even appear to reflect the lobbying power of big financial players .
indeed , at stake in the mortgage settlement are fundamental and systemic breaches of the rule of law – perjury and fraud on an economy-wide scale . the Justice Department has , without question , all of the power that it needs to prosecute these alleged crimes fully .
and maybe officials are right to be afraid , given the massive size of the banks in question relative to the economy . in fact , those banks are bigger now than they were before the crisis , and , as James Kwak and I documented at length in our book 13 Bankers , they are much larger than they were 20 years ago .
political leaders can huff and puff as much as they want , but , without a credible threat of poverty and time behind bars , bankers have no reason to comply with the law . for them , it ’ s all about the trade – and you can be the sucker in public policy as easily as you can be the sucker in an individual loan agreement .
the message to bank executives today is simple : build your bank to be as big as possible – and then keep growing . if you manage to become big enough , you and your employees are not just too big to fail , but also too big to jail .
the Obama administration has just made everyone else the sucker .
too European to Fail
Berlin – Among investment bankers , there is renewed speculation about the possibility of a country leaving European Monetary Union – or being pushed out . rating agencies have downgraded Portugal , Greece , and Spain , owing to their poor prospects for economic growth and weak public finances .
with fears mounting that one or another euro-zone country may default , yield spreads on government bonds between EMU countries have reached record highs . for some time now , Greek ten-year government-bond yields have been about 300 basis points above German yields .
but the panic that EMU may disintegrate is overdone . rather than a default and subsequent exit from the euro zone , the member states are more likely to overrule a fundamental principle of EMU and bail out a fellow member state .
of course , regaining the exchange rate as an instrument for competitive devaluation could help overcome competitiveness losses due to soaring unit-labor costs . as Argentina showed after its default and devaluation in the winter of 2001 / 2002 , such a move can reignite exports and economic growth .
as a default would demand a change in the currency involved in private contracts , business partners from other EU countries would surely sue , legal uncertainties would drag on and on , and an exiting country ’ s trade with its main trading partners would be impaired for years to come . so none of the countries at risk would seriously consider reintroducing a national currency .
indeed , even something like a self-fulfilling debt crisis is thinkable : if market participants believe that a default or an exit from EMU is imminent , this would drive up government bond yields for the country in question . at some point , yields might become so high that the government concerned could not refinance its maturing debt or finance its current expenses .
letting one member fail would create speculative pressure on other EMU governments with weak fiscal positions or shallow domestic bond markets . a widespread default of several countries in EMU would lead to serious disruptions of trade within the EU and to new problems in the banking system , which would have to write down their holdings of government bonds .
with its loans to Hungary and Latvia , the European Commission has already revived a credit facility which was dormant since the European Monetary System crisis in 1992 – and for countries outside EMU . the support is huge .
by supporting to such a degree two new EU members that are not part of EMU , the EU countries have demonstrated a much greater commitment to mutual aid than was thinkable only a few years ago . and more is expected to come : in November 2008 , the Ecofin Council increased the ceiling for possible balance-of-payment loans to non-EMU countries to € 25 billion .
against this background , it seems inconceivable that the EU should refuse to support an EMU member in a situation similar to that of Hungary and Latvia , especially as all the countries that are currently on market watch lists are long-time EU members . in case of real distress , the rest of the EU will offer a bailout package .
indeed , the no-bailout clause in Article 103 of the EU Treaty – according to which neither the European Central Bank , the EU , nor national governments “ shall &#91; … &#93; amp # 160 ; be liable for or assume the commitments ” for other national governments – has lost its credibility . the political and economic costs of letting a fellow member government fail are simply too high in the closely interconnected EMU .
because there is no current blueprint for this move , one can only speculate about what it would look like . one option is for large EU countries to construct a bailout package .
the EU is good at circumventing treaty obligations in times of real crisis . there is no reason to expect this skillfulness to desert it this time around .
too Much Saving , Too Little Investment
talk abounds of a global savings glut . in fact , the world economy suffers not from too much saving , but from too little investment .
how well the world makes them will determine whether the strong global growth of the last few years will be sustainable . this is the central message of the IMF ’ s World Economic Outlook , which will be released this week &#91; editors : on Wednesday , September 21st 2005 &#93; on the eve of the Fund ’ s 2005 Annual Meeting .
first , consumption has to give way smoothly to investment , as past excess capacity is worked off and as expansionary policies in industrial countries normalize . second , to reduce the current account imbalances that have built up , demand has to shift from countries running deficits to countries running surpluses .
the current situation has its roots in a series of crises over the last decade that were caused by excessive investment , particularly the bursting of the Japanese asset bubble , crises in emerging Asia and Latin America , and the collapse of the IT bubble in industrial countries . investment has fallen off sharply since , and has since staged only a very cautious recovery .
in the industrial countries , expansionary budgets , coupled with low interest rates and elevated asset prices , has led to consumption- or credit-fueled growth , particularly in Anglo-Saxon countries . government savings have fallen , especially in the United States and Japan , and household savings have virtually disappeared in some countries with housing booms .
some countries have primary fiscal surpluses for the first time , and most emerging markets have brought down inflation through tight monetary policy . with corporations cautious about investing and governments prudent about expenditure – especially given the grandiose investments of the past – exports have led growth .
we should celebrate the implicit global policy coordination that enabled the world to weather the crises of recent years . however , the fact that rich countries are consuming more , and are being supplied and financed by emerging markets , is not a new world order ; it is a temporary and effective response to crises .
indeed , it is misleading to term this situation a “ savings glut , ” for that would imply that countries running current-account surpluses should reduce domestic incentives to save . but if the problem is weak investment , then a reduction in such incentives will lead to excessively high real interest rates when the factors holding back investment dissipate .
first , with asset prices like housing fueled by global liquidity , goods prices kept quiescent by excess capacity and global trade , and interest rates held down by muted investment , domestic and external imbalances have been easily financed . the traditional signals provided by inflation expectations , long-term interest rates , and exchange rates have not started flashing .
the worry , then , is that when the signals change – as they must – they will change abruptly , with attendant harsh consequences for growth . Alternatively , prices such as that of oil will have to move more in order to effect the most pressing transitions , creating new imbalances .
second , more investment is needed , particularly in low-income countries , emerging markets , and oil producers ( though less in China , the exception that proves the rule ) . but the answer is not a low-quality investment binge led by government or fuelled by easy credit ; we know the consequences of that .
strong exports and decent government policies have enabled some countries to generate growth without the reforms that can create the right incentives for investment . these countries are overly dependent on demand elsewhere , which in turn is unsustainable .
with the right reforms , adopted in concert , the world can make the needed transitions . but one of the risks associated with the large current-account imbalances we now face is that politicians may decide to blame one or another country and espouse protectionist policies .
if , instead , countries see the transitions as a shared responsibility , each country ’ s policymakers may be able to guide the domestic debate away from the protectionism that might otherwise come naturally . each country should focus on what it needs to do to achieve sustained long-term growth .
too Much “ Too Big to Fail ” ?
London – Obviously , the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 was partly one of specific , systemically important banks and other financial institutions such as AIG . in response , there is an intense debate about the problems caused when such institutions are said to be “ too big to fail . ”
politically , that debate focuses on the costs of bailouts and on tax schemes designed to “ get our money back . ” For economists , the debate focuses on the moral hazard created by ex ante expectations of a bailout , which reduce market discipline on excessive risk-taking – as well as on the unfair advantage that such implicit guarantees give to large players over their small-enough-to-fail competitors .
numerous policy options to deal with this problem are now being debated . these include higher capital ratios for systemically important banks , stricter supervision , limits on trading activity , pre-designated resolution and recovery plans , and taxes aimed not at “ getting our money back , ” but at internalizing externalities – that is , making those at fault pay the social costs of their behavior – and creating better incentives .
I am convinced that finding answers to the too-big-to-fail problem is necessary – indeed , it is the central issue being considered by the Standing Committee of the Financial Stability Board , which I chair . but we must not confuse “ necessary ” with “ sufficient ” ; there is a danger that an exclusive focus on institutions that are too big to fail could divert us from more fundamental issues .
but when we look back on this crisis in , say , ten years , what may be striking is how small the direct costs of rescue will appear . many government funding guarantees will turn out to have been costless : liquidity support provided by central banks at market or punitive rates will often show a profit , and capital injections will be partly and sometimes wholly recovered when stakes are sold .
all of this implies that the crucial problem is not the fiscal cost of rescue , but the macroeconomic volatility induced by precarious credit supply – first provided too easily and at too low a price , and then severely restricted . and it is possible – indeed , I suspect likely – that such credit-supply problems would exist even if the too-big-to-fail problem were effectively addressed .
if such banks fail , they are resolved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) in the normal fashion , and this has always been the market ’ s ex ante expectation . in the UK , similarly , we have had problems with mid-sized mortgage banks , and with poor commercial real-estate lending by mutual building societies , as well as problems with two large banks .
there is therefore a danger that excessive focus on “ too big to fail ” could become a new form of the belief that if only we could identify and correct some crucial market failure , we would , at last , achieve a stable and self-equilibrating system . many of the problems that led to the crisis – and that could give rise to future crises if left unaddressed – originated elsewhere .
to the Victors Go the Foils
new YORK – A surprising number of elections and political transitions is scheduled to occur over the coming months . an incomplete list includes Russia , China , France , the United States , Egypt , Mexico , and South Korea .
some are well-established democracies ; some are authoritarian systems ; and others are somewhere in between . yet , for all of their differences , these governments – and the individuals who will lead them – face many of the same challenges .
to one degree or another , all depend on access to foreign markets to sell their manufactured goods , agricultural products , resources , or services – or to supply them . none can eliminate economic competition with others over access to third-country markets .
but economic dependence on others is not the only international reality with which governments must contend . it is equally difficult – if not impossible – for countries to isolate themselves from terrorism , weapons , pandemic disease , or climate change .
George Orwell ’ s vision of 1984 could hardly have been more wrong , because the hallmark of modern technology is not Big Brother , but decentralization . more computing power can now be held on a desktop or in a person ’ s hand than could be gathered in a room only a generation ago . &amp; nbsp ;
as a result , people everywhere now have more access to more sources of information than ever before. making it increasingly difficult for governments to control , much less monopolize , the flow of knowledge . citizens also have a growing ability through mobile phones and social networking to communicate directly and discreetly with one another . &amp; nbsp ;
but modern technology also has implications for well-established democracies . it is far more difficult to generate social consensus and to govern in a world in which citizens can choose what they read , watch , and listen to , and with whom they talk .
a third widespread challenge that awaits emerging leaders is the inescapable reality that citizens ’ demands increasingly overwhelm the capacity to satisfy them . this was always true in the so-called developing ( and often relatively poor ) world .
but growth is also slowing in China and India , which together account for more than one-third of the world ’ s population . unemployment rates are high , especially in the US and Western Europe , and especially among the young and those nearing the end of their careers ( but who are still expected to live for decades ) .
together , these three trends – a loss of economic and physical autonomy , the diffusion of information technology , and slower growth against a backdrop of larger and older populations – will create enormous political challenges in virtually every country . demands are mounting at the same time as the ability of governments to satisfy them is diminishing .
leaders will also have to confront the byproducts of increased nationalism , populism , and , in some cases , extremism . hostility to immigration and economic protectionism , already visible , can be projected to increase .
these developments within countries will make more difficult the challenge of generating global consensus on how to meet threats beyond borders : as governing successfully at home becomes more difficult , so will governing abroad . for citizens and leaders alike , tough times lie ahead .
toward a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union ?
Frankfurt – Since Europe ’ s Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) was created , no progress toward political unification has been made – or even really attempted . now that Europe ’ s current crisis has convinced many that existing institutional arrangements are unsustainable , this may be about to change .
while the report contains a number of important observations , its underlying assumption – that steps toward all of its goals should be taken in parallel , with a genuine political union emerging at the end of the process – is problematic . after all , establishing a political union would require amendments to national constitutions and , in most countries , referendums .
but the euro is no longer a strong common currency that reinforces a shared European identity . on the contrary , it is now a source of deep resentment among European peoples – resentment that , 70 years after the end of World War II , was supposed to have been eliminated .
but can this approach work at a time when there is so little trust among member countries ? or would pushing forward under such circumstances create even more resistance ?
the five presidents recommend launching their proposed agenda to reinvigorate integration only after 2017 . it seems likely that this timing reflects the fear that voters in the biggest countries , where elections will be held in the next two years , will react negatively to the proposal .
the reality is that a European political union is unlikely to be established anytime soon . and without true political unification , efforts to pursue the rest of the presidents ’ plan , including the transfer of fiscal competencies to the European level , would carry serious risks .
limited or not , this is a transfer of fiscal responsibility to the European level . and it is difficult to imagine how the report ’ s call for “ democratic accountability and legitimacy ” in the decision-making process can be met without a full-fledged political union .
there is a fundamental conflict between the call to give priority to European needs and the dictates of member states ’ constitutions , which cannot be resolved by gradually shifting competences de facto from the national to the European level , or by expanding the EU budget . within the existing institutional framework , political responsibility for higher transfer payments among countries must remain with the national governments , controlled by national parliaments and electorates .
it cannot , however , be achieved through the back door , by eroding members ’ fiscal-policy sovereignty . attempting to compel transfer payments would generate moral hazard on the part of the recipients and resistance from the donors , with the resulting increase in tensions possibly jeopardizing the integration that has been achieved so far .
the key to making such a system work is to ensure that national governments are held accountable for their economic policies . all treaties and commitments – including , crucially , the Maastricht Treaty ’ s “ no bailout ” clause – must be respected without exception .
Pacta sunt servanda – agreements must be honored . if this principle is permanently violated , how can one expect a prosperous future based on a new set of treaties that are even more demanding than the existing ones ?
toward a Peaceful Pacific
Melbourne – The Western Pacific is currently facing a difficult problem – how to accommodate China ’ s rising aspirations in a region where the United States has held primacy since the Cold War ’ s end . is the US determined to maintain dominance in the Asia-Pacific region ?
it is difficult to see the stationing of 2,500 US Marines in Darwin , Australia – a decision announced by US President Barack Obama on his recent tour of Asia – as anything more than a symbolic gesture , a provocative reminder that the US is determined to stay in the region . America ’ s purpose , however , remains unclear .
across the Asia-Pacific region , China ’ s rise is viewed as a welcome development , but one that requires China to play within internationally accepted rules . that dictum , of course , should apply to everyone .
the US , on the other hand , continues to dominate militarily , while its economic influence is waning . in any case , China will invariably respond harshly to US efforts to step up its military presence in the region .
the Korean peninsula , Taiwan , and the South China Sea ’ s islands and sea lanes are all issues of potential dispute between the US and China . but , while these issues are important , both sides should pursue diplomatic efforts to minimize Sino-American rivalry over them – and thus avoid embarking on a new cold war .
but it is doubtful that the US offers China much transparency about its own military capabilities . to put the issue in perspective , the US defense budget constitutes 43 % of all military spending worldwide , whereas China ’ s expenditure represents a little over 7 % .
too many observers forget that China ’ s nuclear force is a deterrent only – far too small to be a first-strike force . and China is among the first countries prepared to make a no-first-use pledge , provided other nuclear powers reciprocate .
the Chinese remember all too painfully the unequal treaties imposed by the Western powers on China and Japan in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . an alliance between the US , Japan , Australia , and possibly India designed to contain China would be greeted by the Chinese with that history firmly in mind .
China will most likely regard the cooperation agreement recently announced by the Japanese and Indian defense ministers as a response to US pressure . its leaders will again suggest that a policy of containment is being pursued , and that this Cold War strategic concept is inimical to peaceful development in the Western Pacific .
for example , China has helped – maybe not enough – with the problems presented by North Korea . to reduce tensions in the region , perhaps the US should initiate long-avoided direct talks with North Korea , which could help to resolve the security issues posed by that country ’ s regime .
the islands , claimed by China , Taiwan , Vietnam , the Philippines , Malaysia , and Brunei , are valuable because of their oil reserves and commercial fishing industry . it is critical that the countries claiming sovereignty over the islands abide by international law and commit to keeping the area ’ s sea-lanes open .
of course , diplomacy needs to be backed by strength , but the US has plenty without militarizing the Asia-Pacific region more than it already has . peaceful resolution of these conflicts requires giving China a role in the decision-making process , which implies that the US and China alike relinquish any desire for regional primacy .
during the first Taiwan Straits crisis in 1954 , China began shelling the offshore islands Quemoy and Matsu , threatening to “ liberate ” Taiwan . as the US contemplated a possible nuclear attack on China , Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies quietly told US President Dwight Eisenhower , “ If there is a war over Taiwan , it is your affair and not ours . ”
the stationing of US Marines in northern Australia thus appears pointless : these troops have no conceivable reason to be there . in addition , they have divided Australian public opinion unnecessarily on the vital issue of the country ’ s security .
Asia today presents a completely new and unique set of circumstances . the dilemmas arising from these circumstances demand new solutions , not obsolete Cold War-era concepts .
towards an Asia-Europe Partnership
Asia ’ s rise as an economic and political player exemplifies what globalization is all about . by the decade ’ s end , China ’ s economy will be larger than Germany ’ s .
the other side is persistent poverty , lack of development , massive environmental degradation , a widespread rural-urban divide , demographic problems , and troubled banking systems . the picture is further complicated by security risks such as nuclear arms proliferation , fundamentalism , and weak or failing governance .
the sweeping changes underway in Asia are not just economic , but have also created new political realities that cannot be ignored . Asian countries now act with much greater self-assurance than in the past .
the “ soft power ” of Europe ’ s political and social model is well known . as an Asian leader once told me , Europeans have what many Asian societies aspire to : democratic government , advanced infrastructure , civil rights , world-class companies , high educational and social standards , and a rich cultural heritage .
it is crucial to ensure that our European model , with its emphasis on a fair deal for everyone , remains competitive . nevertheless , Germany stands to lose more than any other country from any protectionist-minded retreat from globalization .
artificially low exchange rates , restrictions on capital flows , and excessively large currency reserves all create global imbalances . any strategic partnership between Europe and Asia must encourage global economic responsibility based on cooperation and transparency .
Europe and Asia must jointly commit to an agenda underscoring global resources and sustainability . environmental , climate , and energy issues concern everyone .
growth is important to us in Europe , and it is even more important to Asia ‘ s emerging economies . but , as European experience shows , it is often worth sacrificing short-term benefits for the sake of longer-term gain .
the history of European integration suggests that regional cooperation , give and take , the pursuit of shared goals , and even in some areas the transfer of sovereignty are the best ways to overcome tensions and promote peaceful problem-solving . certain elements of this European path may be relevant to Asia ’ s own regional cooperation .
ASEAN members conduct almost 50 % of their trade within Asia . economic relations between major players such as China and Japan are increasingly close – owing not only to booming trade , but also to direct investment and regional production networks .
ASEAN , together with its affiliated bodies such as the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit , is the driving force behind the intensification of Asian cooperation , in which security , too , is a factor . ASEAN is working with its partners to tackle global issues such as security , energy , and climate change , and its plans for a charter on enhanced cooperation is an encouraging first step toward creating a political architecture .
the foreign ministers ’ meeting held during Germany ’ s EU Council presidency produced the Nuremberg Declaration , which established a framework for closer EU-ASEAN partnership . Europe must become a stakeholder in Asia if both sides are to gain maximum benefit from cooperation and help shape the world of the future .
in Asia , people increasingly realize that sharing in global prosperity also means sharing responsibility for global peace and development . we see this in the higher profile that China has taken in defusing the North Korean nuclear crisis and in drafting the recent Security Council resolution on Darfur .
in the light of developments such as in Myanmar , ASEAN must state clearly where it stands . this recalibration of global responsibility will have to be a step-by-step process fostering dialogue and stability .
the challenge for twenty-first century statecraft will be to devise joint solutions to common problems . this was what inspired the Heiligendamm Process launched at this year ’ s G-8 Summit , which for the first time brought G-8 leaders together with leaders of the world ’ s major emerging economies , including China , India , Brazil , Mexico , and South Africa .
there is no inevitable contradiction between European values , on the one hand , and what are deemed Asian values , on the other . where interests conflict and opportunities coexist with tensions , a readiness and capacity for dialogue is the only way forward .
in this progressive transformation of the international system , German and European foreign policy will play an active role . what is needed is not rhetoric , but levelheaded efforts to find practical and forward-looking solutions to key issues on which regional and international cooperation is urgently required .
toxic Tests
Cambridge – The United States government is now permitting ten of America ’ s biggest banks to repay about $ 70 billion of the capital injected into them last fall . this decision followed the banks having passed the so-called “ stress tests ” of their financial viability , which the US Treasury demanded , and the success of some of them in raising the additional capital that the tests suggested they needed .
many people have inferred from this sequence of events that US banks – which are critical to both the American and world economies – are now out of trouble . but that inference is seriously mistaken .
in a meeting this month , finance ministers of G-8 countries agreed to follow the US and perform stress tests on their banks . but , if the results of such tests are to be reliable , they should avoid the US tests ’ fundamental flaw .
although accounting rules often permit banks to price these assets at face value , it is generally believed that the fundamental value of many toxic assets has fallen significantly below face value . the Obama administration came out with a plan to spend up to $ 1 trillion dollars to buy banks ’ toxic assets , but the plan has been put on hold .
it might have been hoped that the bank supervisors who stress-tested the banks would try to estimate the size of the banks ’ losses on toxic assets . instead , supervisors estimated only losses that banks can be expected to incur on loans ( and other assets ) that will come to maturity by the end of 2010 .
although we don ’ t yet have an estimate of the economic losses the stress tests have chosen to ignore , they may be substantial . according to a recent report by Deutsche Bank , for example , borrowers will have difficulty refinancing hundreds of billions of dollars of commercial real estate loans that will mature after 2010 .
but doesn ’ t the banks ’ ability to raise new equity capital indicate that , regardless of whether the stress tests are reliable , investors believe that their assets ’ value does significantly exceed their liabilities ?
suppose that the bank has assets with long maturity and a face value of $ 1.2 billion but whose current economic value is only $ 1 billion . although the value of the bank ’ s assets doesn ’ t exceed its liabilities , depositors won ’ t flee as long as the government backs the bank by guaranteeing its deposits .
to get a good picture of banks ’ financial health , estimating the value of their toxic assets is unavoidable . regulators could encourage each bank to sell part of its toxic portfolio and extrapolate the portfolio ’ s value from the price obtained in such a sale , or they could attempt to estimate the portfolio ’ s value as well as they can on their own .
either way , the true value of banks ’ toxic assets must be estimated before concluding that banks are armed with sufficient capital to carry out their critical roles . the kind of stress tests that the US conducted , and that other countries are being urged to emulate – and the ability of banks to raise additional equity capital – cannot provide a basis for such a conclusion .
the Fraught Politics of the TPP
if ratified and implemented , it will have a monumental impact on trade and capital flows along the Pacific Rim . indeed , it will contribute to the ongoing transformation of the international order .
the economics of trade and finance that form the TPP ’ s foundations are rather simple , and have been known since the British political economist David Ricardo described them in the nineteenth century . by enabling countries to make the most of their comparative advantages , the liberalization of trade and investment provides net economic benefits , although it may hurt particular groups that previously benefitted from tariff protections .
for them , the overall economic benefits of trade liberalization matter little , if their own narrow interests are being undercut . even if these groups are relatively small , the discipline and unity with which they fight trade liberalization can amplify their political influence considerably – especially if a powerful political figure takes up their cause .
but now that she is on the presidential campaign trail , she has changed her tune . the reason is apparent : she has judged that she cannot afford to lose the support of American trade unions such as the United Automobile Workers , whose members fear a reduction in tariffs on car and trucks .
the concessions it contains on manufactured products like automobiles are much smaller than those on , say , agricultural products , which will involve profound sacrifices from other TPP countries , such as Japan . after all , existing tariff levels on manufactured goods are already much lower than those on agriculture or dairy products .
in short , with the TPP , the US is catching a big fish with small bait . but the increased trade and investment flows brought about by the TPP ’ s ratification and implementation will benefit even the countries that must make larger sacrifices .
the third component , or “ arrow , ” of Abenomics – structural reforms – aims to restore growth by raising productivity . but increasing efficiency in a wide variety of sectors , as Japan must do , can be a long , difficult , and piecemeal process , as it involves the upgrading of virtually every technology and process .
by connecting Japan ’ s industries more closely with those of other countries , the TPP can accelerate this process considerably . moreover , it can spur faster administrative reform .
as the economist Jagdish Bhagwati points out , maintaining increased protections for , say , intellectual property may encourage research and innovation . at the same time , however , excessive IP protections can deter the proliferation of existing knowledge and the development of high-tech products .
given all of this , one hopes that opposition from political figures like Clinton amounts to naught – an entirely plausible outcome , in Clinton ’ s case , because the TPP should be enacted before the presidential election in November 2016 . this would , to some extent , be in line with the TPP negotiation process , in which the political challenges associated with trade liberalization have been handled remarkably well .
on the contrary , trade representatives had to display impressive endurance and patience – for more than five years , for some countries . to enable progress , confidentiality was vital ( despite US negotiators ’ claims that the discussions were wholly transparent ) .
failure to ratify the TPP in all 12 countries would be a major disappointment , not just because of the tremendous amount of effort that has gone into it , but also – and more important – because of the vast economic benefits it would bring to all countries involved . in Japan , as long as most of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party stands firm in supporting the TPP , it should be ratified .
Japan ’ s TPP Transformation
Tokyo – On October 5 , after years of exhausting – and exhaustive – haggling , a dozen Pacific Rim countries finally signed up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , an agreement that promises everything from more trade to a cleaner environment . the negotiations were such that the hair of Akira Amari , Japan ’ s economic and fiscal policy minister , turned completely grey .
combined , the TPP economies account for some 40 % of world GDP , outstripping the largest existing free-trade area , the European Union . once the TPP enters into effect , its impact on the global economy will undoubtedly be monumental – even without the participation of China , which on a purchasing-power-parity basis is now the world ’ s biggest economy .
one example is President Xi Jinping ’ s recent visit to the United Kingdom – which in essence is also an attempt to weaken Britain ’ s “ special relationship ” with the US by creating a cat ’ s cradle of trade , financial , and investment ties with Britain . it is worth noting that Xi had already lured the UK into supporting – against American advice – the new , China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank .
but , as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ’ s recent call for talks with China on the issue confirm , the TPP is not off-limits to China – or to other Asian economies . South Korea is warming to the idea of the TPP , as is Indonesia , following President Joko Widodo ’ s recent visit to Washington , DC .
for Japan , the TPP is vital to achieve economic liberalization – the third arrow of “ Abenomics , ” the government ’ s program to revitalize the country ’ s ailing economy . the legislation to enact the TPP will simply push aside the lobbies and vested interests that have been so effective in slowing down or diverting piecemeal reforms .
the promise of greater exchange of goods , services , and capital across the Pacific , as well as the creation of international standards ( for example , for intellectual-property rights ) , is simply too appealing to ignore . when Japan and other Asian countries weigh the risk of implementing the TPP against the risk of not participating , the risk of not participating is overwhelmingly higher .
the customs duty on beef imports , for example , is currently 38.5 % . it will be 27.5 % in the first year after the TPP takes effect , and will then be gradually lowered to 9 % in the agreement ’ s 16th year .
that should surely provide more than enough time for Japanese beef ranchers to prepare themselves for foreign competition ( of the 870,000 tons of beef imported annually , 520,000 tons come from Australia , the US , and New Zealand ) . and it will certainly be a boon for consumers , as the price of their beef-noodle soup and sukiyaki falls dramatically .
because they deal with animals , shortcuts cannot be taken , and there are limits to mechanization , particularly in creating the type of beef that Japanese consumers demand . whereas ranchers in Australia and the US have huge herds of cattle , Japanese ranchers raise each individual cow on beer and massages .
taking advantage of the worldwide sushi boom , Japan needs to emphasize that “ real sushi requires Japanese rice , ” branding it an exclusive product . skeptics should note that Italy has already succeeded in this , with top-tier restaurants around the world advertising that they use genuine Italian pasta .
in fact , regardless of whether or not the TPP is implemented , Japan ’ s farmers must pursue this approach to secure their futures , rather than hoping that protective subsidies continue ad infinitum . under the logic of the TPP , the terraced rice fields that make up Japan ’ s beautiful landscape cannot be protected .
the TPP has been signed – but it will not be implemented unless and until it is ratified by the legislatures of countries such as the US and Canada . that process could well be enough to turn Amari ’ s gray hair white .
the TPP ’ s Missing Ingredient
Washington , DC – Looking for ways to stimulate economic growth and create jobs , US President Barack Obama ’ s administration is seeking to press ahead with the mega-regional free-trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) . but is the US going about it the right way ?
the TPP ’ s initial scope was relatively modest , involving the United States and a range of trading partners ( Australia , Brunei Darussalam , Canada , Chile , Malaysia , Mexico , New Zealand , Peru , Singapore , and Vietnam ) . but now Japan is on board , South Korea is watching closely , and there is potential for engaging with China through this or a similar framework in the foreseeable future .
the typical approach when seeking to finalize an agreement aimed at reducing trade barriers – while attempting to protect labor and environmental standards – is to ask for less , not more , from those on the other side of the table . but at this stage , the TPP is different : the odds of success would be much greater if the US attached the additional requirement that participating countries do not engage in currency manipulation .
one of the major shortcomings of the global trading system in recent decades has been the absence of an effective constraint on countries that intervene heavily in order to keep their currencies undervalued . a significantly undervalued currency implies a potentially large trade surplus .
ordinarily , a large surplus puts upward pressure on the country ’ s currency – making its exports less competitive and boosting demand for imported goods and services . but a country ’ s authorities can prevent appreciation for a prolonged period of time by buying up foreign currency .
such intervention results in the accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves – much of which is held in the form of US government debt . in one way , this benefits the US by helping to keep interest rates lower than they would be otherwise .
the International Monetary Fund was founded , in part , to prevent precisely this type of beggar-thy-neighbor economic strategy , which resulted in “ competitive devaluations ” during the 1930s . unfortunately , the IMF in recent years has proved unable or unwilling to do so .
similarly , the US Treasury is legally required to determine if a country is intervening to an unfair and unreasonable extent . in practice , however , the Treasury ’ s reports on this issue are generally toothless and lead to no real consequences .
Fred Bergsten and Joseph Gagnon , my colleagues at the Peterson Institute , have proposed including a currency clause in any TPP deal . in essence , this would amount to the signatories agreeing not to manipulate their currencies .
there is strong support on Capitol Hill , from both Democrats and Republicans , for finding some way to limit currency manipulation . even people who are very much in favor of freer trade – and even of some version of the TPP , like Bergsten and Gagnon – believe that some Asian countries have overstepped the boundaries of reasonable behavior .
with the level of intervention by major countries currently limited ( China ) or non-existent ( Japan ) , this is an ideal moment to include a currency clause in the TPP , as most countries are less likely to become defensive . participating countries could allow their currencies to float , or they could operate a fixed exchange rate .
of course , how the politics plays out will depend on what happens in the US mid-term congressional elections in November , as well as how key figures position themselves for the presidential election in 2016 . but both parties are generally interested in supporting free trade , along responsible lines – and recognize legitimate concerns .
currency manipulation has become a little too ugly in recent years – with associated adverse effects on sectors and communities in the US – for elected representatives to ignore . it is to be hoped that the other TPP countries also come to understand that the agreement is more likely to work if it strongly discourages currency manipulation .
getting the Trans-Pacific Partnership Right
Washington , DC – The United States Congress has now given President Barack Obama so-called fast-track negotiating authority to conclude the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , the proposed mega-regional free-trade agreement among the US and 11 other countries . but Obama ’ s victory was not an easy one : members of his own Democratic Party overwhelmingly opposed fast-track authority , which limits Congress to a single up-or-down vote on finished trade agreements , thereby ruling out amendments .
they want the Obama administration to ensure that the TPP includes core international labor standards for all participants , a high level of environmental protection , and access to affordable medicines , among other measures . if the administration takes these entirely reasonable demands on board , the resulting agreement would have considerable bipartisan support .
though Obama has promised that the TPP will be the most progressive trade agreement in history , which is achievable , the shroud of secrecy that surrounds almost all details of the negotiations has made it difficult to evaluate claims and counterclaims on this point . but once the agreement is concluded , it will be published in full , leaving no possibility of obfuscation .
and the markers that have been laid down by congressional Democrats are very clear , quite specific , and well thought-out . in fact , in an agreement between House Democrats and former President George W. Bush ’ s administration in May 2007 , almost all of the key principles were already spelled out in considerable detail .
in 2005 , only 15 House Democrats voted for the Central American Free Trade Agreement , precisely because its terms on labor standards and the environment were so weak . in 2007 , by contrast , 109 House Democrats voted in favor of the US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement , precisely because its terms had been adjusted as requested and in line with the May agreement .
all forms of forced or compulsory labor – including human trafficking – should be prohibited . vague promises on these issues are not acceptable ; countries must enter into compliance before a trade agreement takes effect .
moreover , the agreement calls for the inclusion of existing international environmental standards in free-trade agreements , including rules concerning pollution and endangered animals . likewise , such agreements should support fair access to pharmaceutical patents and to the data used to prove the safety of medical treatments .
in a paper issued in January 2015 , and again in a major speech in May , Sander Levin , the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee , applied these principles to all of the outstanding issues regarding the TPP .
some participants in the TPP may indeed balk at being required to raise labor or environmental standards ; in such case , however , policymakers need to ask whether these countries should get easier access to the US market . similarly , access to affordable medicines is something other countries desperately need ; it is large pharmaceutical companies that are not entirely enthusiastic .
Democrats are pushing for provisions to prohibit or limit currency-market intervention by central banks that is intended to give a country ’ s exporters a competitive edge . this is also a huge potential problem with the TPP , because competitive devaluations can swamp any other gains from trade by an order of magnitude , with substantial negative effects on US jobs .
yes , the logic of market-based global commerce is very strong . but every market exists within a specific set of rules , which are not random and are not handed down from the heavens .
the TPP represents an important opportunity to write better rules for international trade and investment . but we are not there yet .
will the TPP Help Latin America ?
Santiago – With the International Monetary Fund having just cut its forecasts for economic growth in Latin America for the fifth year in a row , the region ’ s countries are casting about for ways to reignite investment and boost productivity . they should look to fast-growing Asia , argue advocates of the Transpacific Trade Partnership ( TPP ) , the proposed mega-regional trade accord that would bind together 12 Pacific Rim countries .
but that would require the TPP to foster , not impede , the flow of knowledge around the Pacific Rim . regrettably , the United States is insisting on a series of intellectual-property provisions that serve the interests of US-based firms , but do little to create a sound environment for innovation elsewhere .
the bad news is that Mexico ’ s growth prospects have become inextricably tied to those of its huge neighbor to the north . the good news is that the US is growing faster than any other major industrialized economy , so Mexico can look forward – according to the IMF – to a couple of years of accelerating economic expansion .
Peru and Chile , by contrast , are natural-resource exporters that derived huge benefits from the China-driven commodity boom of the last decade . today commodity prices are down , and so is growth .
that is where Pacific Rim trade and the TPP come in . a firm in Thailand , the Philippines , or Vietnam can develop a new product line by plugging into the huge East Asian value chain and producing , for example , a tiny component which , along with myriad other components , will be assembled into a smartphone at a factory in China .
South America is outside the world ’ s main value chains . innovative firms face the uphill challenge of developing entire new products and selling them in geographically and economically distant markets .
the TPP could help change this by easing trade in intermediate inputs and helping build Pacific-wide value chains . particularly valuable would be straightening out the spaghetti bowl of “ rules of origin ” – the regulations dictating when inputs produced in other countries can be used in products that will qualify for free-trade benefits .
optimists can envision a new generation of trans-Pacific flows of trade , investment , and knowledge , with benefits for all . but then the TPP ’ s boosters have to contend with the obstinacy of Japanese rice farmers ( Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is vowing to address that ) and of US patent and copyright holders .
the US is pushing for longer copyright protection for published works , music , and films . it also wants technical changes that would effectively mean much longer patent terms for pharmaceuticals , make the approval process lengthier for generic drug makers , and extend protections for biologic medicines .
one that has particularly enraged online activists would classify cache copies of websites resulting from Internet searches as temporary copies , so that users would potentially be subject to fines for copyright infringement . there are also concerns about limits to freedom of expression if materials are taken down for alleged copyright violations .
many of these provisions are absent from international agreements currently in force – such as the World Trade Organization ’ s TRIPS accord – and from the bilateral free-trade agreements that the US itself has negotiated with a host of countries . in other cases , protection periods would rise considerably .
but most economists agree that such incentives must be balanced against the need to accelerate knowledge dissemination and absorption , and that the optimum is somewhere in the middle . in this sense , the US demand for longer terms of patent and copyright protection is arbitrary , because they are not founded on a clear-cut case for enhanced economic efficiency .
the politics of the issue is tricky for the TPP ’ s Latin American members . all three have negotiated intellectual-property agreements with the US , achieving what seemed like mutually agreeable levels of protection .
the conundrum is especially vexing for Chile , a country that already has bilateral trade agreements with every potential member of the TPP . if Chile is unlikely to gain substantial new market access , ask critics , why should Chile make trade concessions at all ?
precisely because of the urgent need to diversify their exports , Chile , Peru , and other middle-income countries could benefit tremendously from agreements like the TPP . but that potential will be realized only if more knowledge , not less , flows across member countries ’ borders .
the Case for the TPP
Stanford – Following the conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership by 12 Pacific Rim countries , debates about the costs and benefits of trade liberalization are intensifying . the early leaders in the United States ’ presidential campaign , both the Republican Donald Trump and the Democrat Hillary Clinton , have expressed opposition to the TPP , though as Secretary of State , Clinton called it the “ the gold standard of trade deals . ”
historically , trade systems have ranged from rather open to severely restricted by rules , tariffs , or non-tariff barriers , driven by shifts in the relative strength of liberalizing or protectionist economic and political forces . but even in closed systems , however severe the penalties they impose on trade , black markets usually develop , owing to the “ gains from trade ” generated by natural economic forces .
Alexander Hamilton , the first US treasury secretary , argued that allowing lower-cost imports would impede the development of domestic “ infant ” industry , which needed time to scale up enough to reduce costs to a competitive level . in recent decades , the anti-trade argument has focused largely on “ unfair ” competition and economic dislocation .
extreme protectionism in the early 1930s , following an era of relatively free international trade , had devastating consequences , ultimately setting the stage for World War II . as the MIT economist Charles Kindleberger showed , America ’ s Smoot-Hawley Tariff , in particular , helped to turn a deep recession into a global depression .
even before the war was over , major powers convened in Bretton Woods , New Hampshire , to establish a new international trade and finance regime , including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . through a succession of lengthy and difficult global negotiations – the so-called “ GATT rounds ” – tariffs were steadily lowered for an increasing variety of goods .
virtually all economists agree that this shift toward freer trade greatly benefited the world ’ s citizens and enhanced global growth . the economists Jeffrey Frankel and David Romer estimate that , in general , trade has a sizeable positive effect on growth .
though the TPP ’ s precise provisions have not been made public , political leaders in the member countries predict that the deal , once ratified and implemented , will add hundreds of billions of dollars to their economies and bolster employment . smaller and developing economies will probably gain the most , relative to size , but everyone will benefit overall .
the alternative to liberalizing trade is not the status quo ; it is a consistent move away from openness . this can occur in a number of ways , such as the erection of non-tariff barriers that favor domestic incumbents at the expense of lower-priced potential imports that would benefit consumers .
moreover , it is much easier to build mutually beneficial trade relationships than it is to resolve military and geopolitical issues , such as combating the Islamic State or resolving tensions in the South China Sea . but strong trade relationships have the potential to encourage cooperation – or , at least , discourage escalation of conflict – in other , more contentious areas .
still , there are some legitimate concerns about the TPP . some worry that it could divert trade from non-member countries or undermine the moribund Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations ( though 20 years ago , the North American Free Trade Agreement had the opposite effect , kick-starting the Uruguay round ) .
given all of this – not to mention renewed attention to national borders , owing to contentious immigration issues , such as the influx of Middle Eastern refugees in Europe – the TPP ’ s ratification is far from certain , especially in the US . the concentrated interests that oppose the agreement may turn out to be more influential than the diffuse interests of all consumers .
that would be a major loss . allowing existing protectionist trade barriers to remain in place – or worsen – would not only deprive citizens in TPP countries of higher incomes ; it would also deal a damaging blow to international cooperation .
tradable Prosperity
Milan – The global economy is experiencing a major growth challenge . many advanced countries are attempting to revive sustainable growth in the face of a decelerating global economy .
in the non-tradable sector ( 60-70 % of the economy in advanced countries ) , the main growth inhibitors are weak demand , as in the United States following the financial crisis , and structural and competitive impediments to productivity , as in Japan . in the tradable sector , growth depends on a country ’ s productivity relative to incomes and competitiveness .
the Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow has shown that growth comes from three sources : the working population , capital investment , and technological progress . a growing young population helps to maintain fiscal balance and ensure intergenerational equity , but it does not by itself increase incomes .
developing countries , once they enter rapid-growth mode , generate growth from capital deepening via investment , in a sense making up for past underinvestment . and it is possible for advanced countries to fall behind by under-investing , particularly in the public sector , relying instead on less sustainable debt-fueled means of generating demand .
but , as Solow noted , investment has its limits , owing to diminishing marginal returns . often , these limits are not binding , but , once capital deepening is exhausted , technological progress , which makes inputs more productive in creating final value , is the long-run driver of growth .
the challenge is to apply these insights in a world characterized by global economic interdependence , major imbalances , and a worsening growth and employment problem . it is a world in which economies are connected directly in the tradable sector of the global economy , and indirectly through the demand and employment linkages between the tradable and non-tradable sectors of individual economies .
in the short run , the non-tradable sector is , by definition , subject to domestic-demand constraints . a shortfall in non-tradable demand inevitably limits growth on that side of the economy .
government can , of course , bridge the gap via deficit spending ( preferably focused on employment-generating investment that enhances future growth ) . but the advanced countries are , to varying degrees , fiscally constrained by relatively high and rising public debt , largely owing to fiscal imbalances that were hidden from view until defective growth models broke down in the crisis of 2008 .
Italy and Spain are clearly constrained by the absence of private capital in their respective sovereign-debt markets , with rising yields threatening their fiscal stability and reform programs . they need the eurozone core and the International Monetary Fund as temporary lenders of last resort until they restore policy credibility and regain investors ’ confidence .
the US sovereign-debt market shows no similar evidence of having reached a limit yet . but bond markets do not issue many early warning signals : witness the sudden run-up of yields in Italy and Spain a year ago .
total demand and its growth do matter , but so does market share . given the growth patterns across advanced and developing countries prior to the crisis , and then the large negative shock , it is likely that there is a shortfall of tradable global aggregate demand , impeding an important component of global growth .
but , for individual economies , relative productivity versus income levels determines the share of global tradable aggregate demand that is accessible . unlike the non-tradable side of the economy , the domestic component of global tradable demand is not an absolute constraint on growth ; nor is the rate of growth of global tradable demand an absolute constraint , given the possibility of increasing share .
of course , not everyone can gain share at the same time . fortunately , if countries increase productivity with the aim of boosting relative productivity and growth potential on the tradable side , this will increase incomes and accelerate the growth of global aggregate demand .
what is true for countries on the tradable side is also true for workers , who are differentially affected by the evolution of global supply chains . the efficient integration of global supply chains has created employment opportunities in developing countries and in the higher value-added sectors of advanced countries .
to be effective and properly targeted , policies need to include an accurate diagnosis of growth potential and impediments in both the tradable and non-tradable parts of the economy . focusing on one ( say , the competitiveness problem in the tradable sector ) to the exclusion of the other ( perhaps a serious non-tradable demand shortfall or stagnant absolute productivity ) will not be enough .
can Trade Agreements Stop Currency Manipulation ?
Washington , DC – It is impossible to deny that trade and exchange rates are closely linked . but does that mean that international trade agreements should include provisions governing national policies that affect currency values ?
Simon Johnson , for example , recently argued that mega-regional agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership should be used to discourage countries from intervening in the currency market to prevent exchange-rate appreciation ; Fred Bergsten has made a similar argument .
as it stands , the relevant international institutions – the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund – are not organized to respond effectively to possible currency manipulation on their own . incorporating macroeconomic policies affecting exchange rates into trade negotiations would require either that the WTO acquire the technical capacity ( and mandate ) to analyze and adjudicate relevant national policies or that the IMF join the dispute-settlement mechanisms that accompany trade treaties .
to be sure , since 2007 , the IMF has prohibited “ large-scale intervention in one direction in the exchange market , ” in a decision on “ bilateral surveillance ” that also identifies “ large and prolonged ” current-account imbalances as a reason for review . but neither that decision nor later IMF policy papers on multilateral surveillance provide specific and comparative quantitative indicators that would eliminate the need for case-by-case judgment .
but , in a world of large short-term capital flows , central-banks ’ policy interest rates – or even just announcements about likely future rates – also have a major impact . moreover , quantitative easing affects exchange rates and trade , even if central banks purchase only domestic assets , as demonstrated by recent movements in the exchange rates of the dollar , the euro , and the yen .
an income-tax hike will reduce private demand ( unless one believes in perfect Ricardian equivalence ) , including demand for other countries ’ exports . other macroeconomic policies of all kinds influence the current-account balance .
in short , for “ policies affecting the exchange rate ” to become part of trade agreements , monetary and fiscal policies would have to become part of trade agreements . in that case , there would be no trade agreements at all .
consider the problem that would be posed by the eurozone – an economy that faces major challenges in reconciling its members ’ divergent monetary , fiscal , and exchange-rate needs . Germany ’ s current-account surplus has stood near 7 % of GDP – bigger than China ’ s – for two years , and is likely to grow even larger , owing to the euro ’ s recent depreciation .
because individual eurozone members have no monetary-policy tools at their disposal , the only way that Germany can reduce its surplus while remaining in the eurozone is to conduct expansionary fiscal policy . the economist Stefan Kawalec has explicitly referred to the current policy mix in the eurozone as “ currency manipulation . ”
the need to wrestle with macroeconomic-policy issues could easily cause talks to bog down – and give protectionist lobbies the political ammunition they need . that is why the Trade Representative is wisely trying not to add macroeconomic policy into the bargaining , despite demands from powerful voices in the US Congress .
indeed , it is even more difficult than reaching trade agreements , which must cover issues like tariffs , quotas , quality standards , regulatory regimes for particular sectors , and relevant microeconomic issues . merging all of these challenging topics into a single negotiation process is a recipe for deadlock .
a better approach would include strengthening the IMF ’ s multilateral surveillance role . doing so would broaden discussions of macroeconomic policy to include employment issues – specifically , the potential impact of large foreign-trade surpluses on domestic jobs .
trade More than Aid
the recent G-8 meeting in Scotland , as well as concerts and celebrity activism , has put a spotlight on the amount of international assistance reaching the countries and peoples of Africa . this is understandable in light of the continent ’ s persistent poverty , seemingly endless conflicts , and the prevalence of HIV-AIDS and other infectious diseases .
the fact that so many problems persist despite tens of billions of dollars of assistance and years of effort is a sad reminder that aid can allow governments to undertake foolish investments that accomplish little , or can easily be siphoned off by corrupt officials . moreover , aid is inherently uncertain , leaving Africans at the mercy of outside forces beyond their control .
another problem with the emphasis on aid ( in addition to the near impossibility of accurately measuring the scale of the flows from all sources ) is that the political effort to increase it absorbs attention that would be better spent on a more powerful instrument of economic development : trade .
trade is the all-but-forgotten weapon in the battle against poverty , but it can provide more help to the poor than aid can . if rich countries – in particular , the United States , the 25 members of the EU , and Japan – really want to help poor people , they will open their markets to what poor countries produce , especially textiles , apparel , agricultural products , and commodities .
phasing out tariffs and import quotas for poor countries ’ exports – and phasing out subsidies for their own producers of agricultural products – would have a dramatic effect on the lives of hundreds of millions of people in Africa and elsewhere . private businesses would develop , jobs would be created , and incomes would rise .
one recent study estimates that incomes in the US alone could rise by $ 500 billion a year if global trade were to become truly free . similarly , incomes around the world would rise significantly from liberalizing more global trade in both goods and services .
what countries must do to join the World Trade Organization is precisely what they must do to become productive and democratic : accept the rule of law , reduce corruption , and become open , accountable , and transparent . at the same time , increased trade can help create and sustain a middle class – precisely the social group that often stands at the forefront of movements for democratic reform .
trade has a strategic benefit as well , for it gives countries a stake in good relations with one another and in maintaining order and stability . a China that trades extensively with the US and its Asian neighbors will think twice before it pursues any policy that would place those relationships at risk .
but if the case for expanding world trade is compelling , the prospects for actually doing so are clouded , owing to a simple but nonetheless fundamental political reality : those who gain from trade , which is almost everyone , are not always aware of it . the benefits of freer trade , such as job creation , lower inflation , and greater consumer choice , are often invisible or only partly visible .
by contrast , those who lose from trade , or who fear that they could lose , while relatively small in number , are anything but invisible . they feel the threat acutely and act accordingly , often dominating their country ’ s political process .
what is needed , therefore , is a pledge by governments to make global trade liberalization a much higher political priority . this will happen only if all of the major trading countries demonstrate a commitment to play by the rules .
for China , this means respecting and enforcing intellectual property rights , allowing non-Chinese firms to compete on an equal basis , and setting its currency at a fair level rather than one that is artificially low . for the US , the EU , and Japan , it means ending massive subsidies to farmers and curtailing other forms of protection provided to uncompetitive sectors .
governments can take these steps if they introduce and expand programs designed to assist those who would lose their jobs as a result of trade liberalization . displaced farmers and workers must be provided with the education and training required to enter new jobs , as well as the funds , health care , and other essential services that they need to tide them through the transition .
the current ( Doha ) round of global trade negotiations is behind schedule ; the next session , to be held in Hong Kong , is only months away . where are the many people who benefit from trade , including the celebrities who care so deeply about alleviating poverty and promoting development ?
the Chimera of Currency Manipulation
Cambridge – US President Barack Obama is still pressing to obtain Trade Promotion Authority and use it to conclude negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) with the European Union . but many in the US Congress insist that provisions must be added to the agreements to prevent currency manipulation .
let ’ s be clear : if the US were to insist that “ strong and enforceable currency disciplines ” be part of trade agreements , no deals would be concluded . other countries would refuse – and they would be right .
true , there are times when particular countries ’ currencies can be judged to be undervalued or overvalued , and there are times when their trading partners have a legitimate interest in raising the issue . but even when currency misalignment is relatively clear , trade agreements are not the right way to address it .
for example the undervalued renminbi was successfully addressed in bilateral China-US discussions from 2004 to 2011 . China allowed the currency to appreciate 35 % over time .
but the fact remains that it is mostly impossible to tell whether a currency is overvalued or undervalued . manipulation is not like the existence of a tariff or quota that can be verified by independent observers .
a necessary condition for concluding that a country is manipulating its currency is that its authorities are intervening in the foreign-exchange market . the People ’ s Bank of China , for example , bought a record quantity of dollars from 2004 to 2014 , thereby preventing the renminbi ’ s exchange rate from appreciating as fast as it otherwise would have done .
for example , under the Plaza Accord , the US joined with Japan , Germany , and other G-7 countries in 1985 to intervene cooperatively to weaken the dollar . indeed , a majority of countries pursue either fixed exchange rates , exchange-rate targets , or managed floating , all of which by definition entail buying and selling foreign exchange to moderate or eliminate exchange-rate fluctuations .
China is not a party to the TPP , but Japan is , and many congressional critics cite it as the target of their insistence that provisions to prevent currency manipulation be included in the deal . the yen has depreciated sharply over the last year , and some US economic interests , particularly the auto industry , accuse Japan of manipulation to keep the currency undervalued .
the euro , too , has depreciated significantly against the dollar over the last year , and some US trade critics want provisions to prevent currency manipulation added to the TTIP . but the European Central Bank has not intervened in the foreign-exchange market since 2000 – and that was to support the euro , not weaken it .
the predictable side effect of quantitative easing ( QE ) – that is , the purchase of domestic bonds – by the BOJ and the ECB has been the depreciation of the yen and the euro . but central banks can hardly be enjoined from easing monetary policy when domestic economic conditions warrant it , as has obviously been the case in Japan and Europe ( and in the US when the Federal Reserve embraced QE ) .
if monetary expansion does not merit the charge of currency manipulation , still less do other sorts of economic policies . some have argued that even though the PBOC has stopped buying US and other foreign assets , China ’ s sovereign wealth funds still do , and that this , too , counts as manipulation .
every country makes policy decisions of many sorts every week , many of which can be expected to have an indirect effect on the exchange rate in one direction or the other . the mere fact that a particular policy might weaken the currency does not make that country a manipulator .
finally , provisions that target other central banks could also be applied against the US . this would not be a case of misusing a tool ( a frequent occurrence in trade policy when interest groups lobby for protection against foreign competition ) ; rather , it would be a case of using the tool in precisely the intended way .
monetary stimulus in one country may even have a beneficial effect on the rest of the world , as its own restored income growth boosts imports from its trading partners . whether one considers the accusations of currency manipulation against the US in 2010 , its trading partners in 2015 , or a future defendant , designating some trade agency to rule on them would merely cause trouble .
trading In Hate
new YORK – The massacre in Norway in July 2011 and the recent attack on a Sikh temple in Oak Creek , Wisconsin , were the work of right-wing extremists who sought to remake the world in their neo-Nazi image . likewise , the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , were the work of Islamist extremists who view other religions and cultures as a threat .
just ask the Japanese , who were continually denounced in the 1980 ’ s as wicked traders . or consider how the unceasing refrain against outsourcing nowadays has demonized India .
with the war ’ s outbreak , Americans of Japanese origin were expropriated and herded into concentration camps . California Attorney General Earl Warren championed the measures – the same Earl Warren , who , a decade later , as Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court , would oversee the rejection of the separate-but-equal doctrine at the heart of America ’ s segregation of its black citizens .
many in the US feared that , just as the nineteenth century had been British and the twentieth century had been American , the twenty-first century would be Japanese . but , unlike the British or the Americans , the Japanese allegedly were gaining ground in nefarious ways , exporting aggressively to the US and unfairly excluding US exports from their domestic market .
virtually every Japanese policy was interpreted in the worst possible light . the propaganda was bipartisan in the US , and , with few noteworthy exceptions , was widely disseminated by the country ’ s uncritical and pseudo-patriotic media .
the effect , particularly given a long history of anti-Japanese sentiment , was a predictable wave of racist violence , including the destruction of Japanese cars . the beating death of Vincent Chin , a Chinese-American who was mistaken for a Japanese , also resonated historically , recalling a pseudo-scientific article on how to distinguish the Chinese from the Japanese that Life magazine published in December 1941 .
the Indian situation in the US today is different ; there is no baggage of unpleasant memories on which prejudice and violence can draw . yet , like a desert cactus , hate can thrive on very little .
in the current presidential election campaign , the Democratic Party is attacking Obama ’ s Republican challenger , Mitt Romney , on the same specious grounds , with a complacent media acquiescing in the Democrats ’ de facto India-baiting .
groups calling themselves “ dot-busters ” have attacked Indian women . when I have written in favor of freer trade and liberal immigration , I have been denounced as a “ curry nigger . ”
outside the US , it is well known that Obama himself pulled the plug on Doha . the notion that “ we are open and others are closed , ” a cherished belief of US politicians and media – and an article of faith with the current administration – also feeds the notion that countries like India are wicked traders , much like the Japanese in the 1980 ’ s .
much of the world expected more elevated behavior from Obama . unfortunately , it has gotten a much lower standard than it anticipated .
trading up Global Trade Talks
in the year since the breakdown of the trade talks in Cancun , sentiment has increasingly grown in the developing world that no agreement is better than a bad agreement . but what would a good agreement look like ?
the British Commonwealth recently posed this question to me and the Initiative for Policy Dialogue , an international network of economists committed to helping developing countries . our first message was that the current round of trade negotiations , especially as it has evolved , does not deserve even to be called a Development Round .
well before the riots that marked the World Trade Organization talks in Seattle in 1999 , I called for a true &quot; development round &quot; of trade talks to redress the inequities of previous rounds . the advanced countries , with their dominant corporate and financial interests , had set the agenda for those negotiations .
our second message was optimistic : if the agenda of the current round is reoriented towards development , and if assistance is provided to manage implementation and adjustment costs , developing countries can gain much . we analyzed which reforms in the international trade regime would most benefit those in the developing world , and we presented an alternative agenda based on our findings .
the results were perhaps obvious : more people live from agriculture in the developing world than from manufacturing , so agricultural liberalization must be high on the agenda . but genuinely beneficial agricultural reform would need to go further than merely transforming export subsidies into other types of subsidies , because many supposedly non-distorting subsidies lead to more output , which hurts producers in developing countries by lowering prices .
trade reforms must be sensitive to the effects on developing countries , many of which are net importers of subsidized agricultural commodities . but some subsidies , like cotton subsidies in the United States , are rightly emblematic of America &apos;s bad faith .
developing countries also need access for the unskilled labor-intensive services in which they have a comparative advantage . these were off the agenda in earlier trade rounds , as the US pushed for liberalization of financial services - thus serving its own comparative advantage .
developing countries &apos; alleged gains from capital market liberalization have been widely discussed ( although recent studies raise some doubts about these benefits ) . nevertheless , the global gains from allowing freer flows of unskilled labor ( even temporarily ) , let alone the benefits to developing countries , far outweigh the benefits from capital market liberalization .
but even a cursory look at these items reveals that they primarily reflect the interests of developed countries . indeed , poor countries &apos; development would arguably have been set back if they had acquiesced in some of the demands .
the single largest area of US government procurement is defense , a sector in which even the European Union has found it difficult to make inroads . are developing countries really targeting this area in the next few years ?
the most important competition issue for developing countries , however , is reform of dumping duties . the US and EU keep out products from developing countries , alleging that they charge less than the cost of production .
this could only be rational if the seller can hope to establish a monopoly position and extract large profits in the future . but few developing countries are in a position to establish such monopoly positions , so the dumping charges are mostly bogus .
as tariff barriers have come down , the unfair &quot; fair trade &quot; laws are increasingly being used as America &apos;s favored protectionist tool . treating foreign and domestic firms the same with respect to competitive practices would stop these abuses .
now that rich countries no longer need to worry about losing the developing world to Communism , they have an opportunity to redefine the global economic order according to the same principles on which they built successful national economies : fair competition and social justice . unfortunately , this opportunity was squandered in the Uruguay Round , as developed countries advanced their own interests at the expense of less developed countries .
it aspired to promote trade as a vehicle of partnership between developed and developing countries . regrettably , in spite of its name , the Development Round has offered far less to developing countries than one would have hoped .
transatlantic Drift
Berlin – On the banks of the Rhine and in Prague , NATO and the European Union will pay homage to the new American president in early April . there will be pretty pictures and lofty speeches on the future of the transatlantic relationship – in other words , business as usual .
the drift in transatlantic relations during the eight years of George W. Bush ’ s presidency was meant to be stopped – and even reversed . that hope is fading , as the global economic crisis brings the differences between America and Europe to a head .
the US wants to resolve the global crisis by providing substantially more financial help , which Europe is refusing to commit , preferring to focus on financial regulatory reform . in the end , a formulaic compromise will be found to include both in the statement .
the media will then praise their respective governments ’ “ courage ” and “ assertiveness , ” and cast the outcome as “ win on points . ” But what will fall by the wayside is a forceful global response to the gravest crisis since 1929 .
the main reason for the new dose of transatlantic drift is that the crisis is being experienced differently . America fears deflation ;
the US has made a complete U-turn in ideological and practical terms , relying on Keynes and massive debt-financed public demand to rein in further economic decline . but Europeans , while having launched national recovery plans , remain unwilling to take on a similar debt risk .
Obama has just been elected for four years , and his political fate depends on whether he can engineer an economic recovery . any hesitation could have profound and irreparable consequences for him .
the economic crash in the United Kingdom is at least as severe as in America , forcing the government to rely almost entirely on deficit spending to prevent a complete meltdown of its financial system . Brown has few options left , and the UK is nowhere near the worst of the crisis .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy don ’ t want to gamble away their own political futures . Merkel will play the central role in deciding how Europe positions itself , not only because she is the leader of the EU ’ s largest economy , but also because she wants to be re-elected in September .
if Merkel opts for substantial deficit spending now , she will lose support , which is already fading fast because of increased state debt , nationalization , stimulus programs , etc . but if unemployment shoots up in the early summer and some household-name companies go under , she could be seen as having done too little , allowing the Social Democrats to grab the election .
it remains to be seen whether the outcome will be decided on the basis of unemployment or state debt . but Merkel will do whatever she can to avoid committing herself prematurely , and the London summit is much too early .
moreover , it is driving the US away from Europe and further in the direction of China . this will undermine the transatlantic relationship even more , enhance China ’ s role in the global handling of the crisis , and in all probability ensure that the Chinese emerge as its biggest winner .
the world will have changed once the global economic crisis is over , and the Europeans will not be able to complain about it then . the world will be more Pacific and less transatlantic , and the new axis of global politics will be formed by the Sino-American tandem .
secretly , the hope in Berlin , Paris , and other European capitals appears to be that Obama will still sort things out . if he succeeds as a super Keynes , no one will have had to take any risks with their own political future .
both stances are equally dangerous as far as Europe ’ s vital interests are concerned . if Europe sees its role in this crisis – which might yet turn into a full-blown depression – as that of a free-rider , it will be treated accordingly in the future .
transforming Science Education
since the mid-nineteenth century , the West has depended on technical innovation and scientific derring-do for its influence and growth . but the West now faces serious competition from the rising nations of Asia , where education in math and science is flourishing .
in general , competition in science and technology is a blessing – the more advanced a nation is , the better a customer it is . and collaboration and exchange of people make for profitable businesses and higher standards of living .
the West , particularly the United States , has lived through such a moment of recognition before , when the USSR launched Sputnik in 1957 . the so-called “ Sputnik shock ” convinced America and the West of the need for radical reform of science education , particularly recruitment , training , and retention of teachers .
essentially all phenomena in chemistry find explanations in the quantum atom , while chemistry and physics undergird molecular biology , which , since the discovery of DNA in the 1950s , dominates modern biology . all other sciences – geology , astronomy , neuroscience , oceanography , and myriad hyphenated subjects – depend upon overlapping combinations of biology , chemistry , and physics .
I believe that it is obsolete , pedagogically disastrous , and ignores the tremendous scientific advances of the twentieth century . other industrial nations may cycle through pieces of the disciplines , missing the essential coherence of the P-C-B sequence .
in studying physics , students study algebra simultaneously , motivating them with a sense of the power of mathematics . moreover , physics begins with everyday phenomena requiring few new words ( as opposed to conventional ninth-grade biology ) : motion , velocity , acceleration , falling objects , a sense of gravity as a force , and some new concepts , e.g. mass , momentum , and energy , but with crisp definitions .
ninth-grade physics , unlike ninth-grade biology , illustrates the grand sweep of the laws of nature , and the power of an equation to describe a vast number of different phenomena can be taught at this level . classroom experiments make use of simple laboratory devices : inclined planes , pulleys , springs , simple pendulums , but the rules that are revealed have validity out in the real world .
here physics introduces scales of distances , atoms to galaxies , scales of time , nanoseconds to centuries , and scales of energy from electron volts to megajoules . these orders of magnitude require metaphors and repetition , but they serve as crucial concepts in our world , especially in cosmology and in evolutionary biology .
Tenth-grade chemistry makes use of ninth-grade physics , deepening and enriching the student ’ s grasp , but no basic chemical or biological principles are required for ninth-grade physics . instead , qualitative applications of physics to chemistry and biology heighten interest and emphasize the connections .
it was not a physicist , but a biologist , Julius Meyer , who first proposed the law of conservation of energy from a study of biological energy processes . the chemist Dalton first gave a proof of the existence of atoms and the engineer Sadi Carnot first gave a proof of the Second Law of Thermodynamics .
the sequence Physics-Chemistry-Biology implies that continuous collegial professional development for teachers is essential . teachers ( including those in mathematics ) should meet regularly to plot the evolution of their courses , their essential coherence , and the inclusion of stories that illustrate how science works .
because this sequence is for all students , what will be retained in the future are the stories and , most importantly , a scientific way of thinking . there is no job , no profession , civic activity that will not profit from this kind of education .
and leadership for this huge revolutionary effort will probably have to come from visionary business executives whose profits depend on education and rationality .
good Trade Intentions Gone Bad
Washington , DC – The debate in the United States about trade has taken an unfortunate turn . instead of discussing the detailed issues on their merits , President Barack Obama ’ s administration has chosen to emphasize the need for fast-track procedures ( also known as trade promotion authority , or TPA ) to negotiate any trade agreement .
unfortunately , the TPP ’ s provisions remain secret – meaning that it cannot be seen or discussed by members of the public . ( members of Congress may read the technical text , under restricted conditions , but are not allowed to describe its contents in detail . )
anyone who raises legitimate concerns about any aspect of the TPP deal is immediately branded “ protectionist . ” The line from the White House is : TPP will lower barriers to US exports , and thus increase jobs and wages .
in fact , TPP will do little for exports – and for an obvious reason . the US already has standard tariff-lowering agreements with almost all of the participating countries .
almost all tariffs on trade among Canada , Mexico , and the US are long gone – that was the effect of the North American Free Trade Agreement . under the Australia and Singapore free-trade agreements as well , almost all tariffs on US goods sold in those countries have been eliminated .
the TPP will amount to a free-trade agreement with Brunei Darussalam ( with a population of less than 500,000 ) and New Zealand ( less than five million ) . encouraging exports to these countries is surely desirable , but the economic impact on the US is unlikely to be more than a rounding error .
that leaves three larger countries where the issues are more complex : Japan ( about 125 million people ) , Malaysia ( around 30 million people ) , and Vietnam ( 90 million people ) .
Japan resists reducing import tariffs on hundreds of agricultural goods , including meat from the US . in addition , non-tariff barriers have long impeded , for example , the export of American-made cars to the Japanese market .
and Japan has had a history of currency intervention , holding down the yen ’ s exchange rate to boost exports and discourage imports – with major negative consequences for the US , among others . Japan does not engage in such currency manipulation currently , and TPP represents a good opportunity to ask the Japanese for a commitment to abandon the practice .
as for Malaysia , important issues regarding forced labor in the export sector have emerged – and there should be full compliance with labor standards before the TPP deal is signed . there are some grounds for optimism here , but promises to implement changes in labor standards after a trade agreement takes effect are seldom fulfilled .
workers ’ rights are also a significant issue . indications are that the TPP negotiations are making little progress – though , again , key details and potential agreements remain highly confidential .
in addition to trade , TPP includes important provisions related to investment , the most prominent of which concern intellectual property rights , such as patents . although Obama says that the TPP is the most progressive trade agreement in history , Sander Levin , the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee – and someone will full access to the text – disagrees .
and TPP will also confer special status on foreign investors , allowing them to sue for financial judgments against host-country regulations . why we would want to provide such differential protection to non-domestic companies is a mystery .
it needs thoughtful , public deliberation about the provisions that are included , as they can have important consequences for the US and its trading partners . unfortunately , the Obama administration prefers to avoid public debate on substantive issues , instead merely insisting on using the fast-track TPA procedures for whatever TPP is agreed .
that is a mistake . if the administration gets a trade agreement and it goes bad – on workers ’ rights , access to medicines , state subsidies , or anything else – how does that help trade , America ’ s foreign partners , or the US economy ?
treason in the Air
Copenhagen – Discussions about global warming are marked by an increasing desire to stamp out “ impure ” thinking , to the point of questioning the value of democratic debate . but shutting down discussion simply means the disappearance of reason from public policy .
in March , Al Gore ’ s science adviser and prominent climate researcher , Jim Hansen , proclaimed that when it comes to dealing with global warming , the “ democratic process isn ’ t working . ” Although science has demonstrated that CO2 from fossil fuels is heating the planet , politicians are unwilling to follow his advice and stop building coal-fired power plants .
what is frustrating people , me included , is that democratic action affects elections , but what we get then from political leaders is greenwash . ” Although he doesn ’ t tell us what the second or third action is , he has turned up in a British court to defend six activists who damaged a coal power station .
after the narrow passage of the Waxman-Markey climate-change bill in the United States House of Representatives , Krugman said that there was no justification for a vote against it . he called virtually all of the members who voted against it , “ climate deniers ” who were committing “ treason against the planet . ”
Krugman said that the “ irresponsibility and immorality ” of the representatives ’ democratic viewpoints were “ unforgivable ” and a “ betrayal . ” He thus accused almost half of the democratically elected members of the House , from both parties , of treason for holding the views that they do – thereby essentially negating democracy .
there is clearly a trend . the climate threat is so great – and democracies are doing so little about it – that people conclude that maybe democracy is part of the problem , and that perhaps people ought not to be allowed to express heterodox opinions on such an important topic .
this is scary , although not without historical precedent . much of the American McCarthyism of the 1940 ’ s and 1950 ’ s was driven by the same burning faith in the righteousness of the mission – a faith that saw fundamental rights abrogated .
we could just as well point out that since science tells us that speeding cars kill many people , we should cut speed limits to almost nothing . we do no such thing , because we recognize that the costs of high-speed cars must be weighed against the benefits of a mobile society .
CO2 emissions result from other , generally beneficial acts , such as burning coal to keep warm , burning kerosene to cook , or burning gas to transport people . the benefits of fossil fuels must be weighed against the costs of global warming .
Gore and Hansen want a moratorium on coal-fired power plants , but neglect the fact that the hundreds of new power plants that will be opened in China and India in the coming years could lift a billion people out of poverty . negating this outcome through a moratorium is clearly no unmitigated good .
likewise , reasonable people can differ on their interpretation of the Waxman-Markey bill . even if we set aside its masses of pork-barrel spending , and analyses that show it may allow more emissions in the US for the first decades , there are more fundamental problems with this legislation .
at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars annually , it will have virtually no impact on climate change . if all of the bill ’ s many provisions were entirely fulfilled , economic models show that it would reduce the temperature by the end of the century by 0.11 ° C ( 0.2 ° F ) – reducing warming by less than 4 % .
even if every Kyoto-obligated country passed its own , duplicate Waxman-Markey bills – which is implausible and would incur significantly higher costs – the global reduction would amount to just 0.22 ° C ( 0.35 ° F ) by the end of this century . the reduction in global temperature would not be measurable in a hundred years , yet the cost would be significant and payable now .
is it treason to question throwing huge sums of money at a policy that will do virtually no good in a hundred years ? is it unreasonable to point out that the inevitable creation of trade barriers that will ensue from Waxman-Markey could eventually cost the world ten times more than the damage climate change could ever have wrought ?
but I would never want to shut down discussion about these issues – whether it is with Gore , Hansen , or Krugman . everybody involved in this discussion should spend more time building and acknowledging good arguments , and less time telling others what they cannot say .
trends and Trendiness at Davos
but the superb sunshine in Davos these days cannot avoid the shadows of the financial crisis that have enveloped the world , casting an atmosphere of gloom and doom on this year ’ s meeting . today , more than ever , the Forum ’ s proud motto , “ Committed to the improvement of the world , ” seems disconnected from reality .
you do not need to go to Davos for this , but in the Swiss mountains these ideas acquire an aura of legitimacy – call it the “ I was told in Davos ” imprimatur – which explains why political and economic analysts and commentators keep coming back , despite the Forum ’ s combination of pomposity and intellectual vacuity . the eminent people who pass through are given opportunities only for sound bites , developed thoughts .
as for business leaders , despite the hefty fees they must pay to become members of the “ Davos Family , ” they , too , keep coming because for them the Forum ultimately represents a time- and money-saving investment . where else in the world could they meet so many of their potential partners or customers , including heads of emerging states , in one place ?
of course , the danger of Davos lies in this concentrated commingling of the chattering classes and the real world of politics and business . conformism flows naturally from these encounters and creates a world in which everybody tends to think alike , as if a truly global community could create a global way of thinking , even if positions on how to address the current financial crisis are varied .
for countries like China or India , the scaling down of growth from 8 % to 5 % is nearly the equivalent of a recession in the West . yesterday , when America sneezed , the world caught a cold .
in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs , Forum ‘ s founder and president , Klaus Schwab , asks “ How can business help save the world ? ” But , with the financial crisis hanging over Davos participants ’ heads like the sword of Damocles , the question is becoming , “ Can states and international institutions save business ? ”
the return of the state , even when it is the power of the European Commission to sanction Microsoft , is on everyone ’ s lips . such a return further underlines a growing skepticism about the market and its key actors ’ infectious and dangerous greed .
but is the world ready for a return to protectionist policies and nationalist reflexes ? will today ’ s freedom and transparency , having led to undesired results , result in a return to restrictions on movements of goods , people , and capital ?
in Davos this year , great hopes have given way to great apprehensions . how can you pretend to be acting to change the world if you no longer understand it ?
Trichet Takes Control At The ECB
the announcement by the President of the European Central Bank , Jean-Claude Trichet , that interest rates would be raised at the next meeting of the bank ’ s Governing Council on December 1st , could be a defining moment in his presidency .
by pre-announcing the rate increase , which senior ECB officials call a move towards greater transparency , Trichet firmly demonstrated his leadership of the Governing Council . press leaks by dissident members had sowed confusion in the public ’ s mind as to the bank ’ s concerns and intentions before the announcement .
even though a consensus had emerged in the Council that a December interest rate hike would be necessary , a handful of holdouts on the ECB Governing Council – some with their own very private agendas – leaked misleading and , in one instance , clearly false information to the press in a futile attempt to thwart the increase .
in an anonymous leak to a major financial news service , an ECB official falsely maintained that unanimity was needed for a rate hike , implying a single dove could stop it . infuriated by what he considered to be guerilla tactics , Trichet effectively silenced the mischief-makers by the bold stroke of pre-announcing the rate hike two weeks before the meeting .
this is not the first time communications has been a problem for the ECB . on more than one occasion , under both Trichet and former ECB chairman Wim Duisenberg before him , press leaks and the tit-for-tat responses they engender , made the Governing Council sound more like a cacophony of discordant voices than a serious deliberative body .
the doves are furious about the pre-announcement , and some hawks – perhaps nostalgic for the more collegial style of Wim Duisenberg – regard Trichet ’ s move as “ showing off ” and “ taking control . ” Indeed , a leading Dutch financial newspaper attacked the pre-announcement as a sign of Trichet ’ s weakness rather than strength , implying that he had lost control of the Governing Council .
the recalcitrance of the holdouts against the consensus – a direct challenge to Trichet ’ s leadership – gave the ECB president little alternative . what was he to do ?
the unwillingness of frustrated minorities to accept consensus may well require the ECB president to take more control of the governing board than it has been used to in the past or , indeed , feel comfortable with in the future . more than anything , the pre-announcement controversy demonstrates that a renewed spirit of consensus and collegiality in the ECB ’ s Governing Council is sorely needed .
“ Inflation targeting ” means that a central bank puts the pursuit of price stability above all other objectives . this is what the ECB does – and what the Fed ’ s Alan Greenspan does not do .
ironically , the “ inflation targeting ” advocated by Greenspan ’ s nominated successor , Ben Bernanke , lies closer to ECB monetary policy than to the discretionary activism that the Fed has practiced during Greenspan ’ s long tenure .
trick or Treat ?
Oxford – A new way of thinking about individual choice has taken the political landscape by storm . America ’ s new president Barack Obama and the leader of the British Conservatives , David Cameron ( just to drop a couple of names ) have shown an interest in it . its intellectual and academic pedigree is impeccable .
but , while System II choices may be more effective than System-I decisions , they are more “ expensive ” to make : one needs data , analysis , and concentration . only when the importance of the task warrants the effort do we shift gear and deploy the System-II heavy artillery .
in these situations , liberal paternalists feel no qualms about taking control and forcing choices upon us ( “ Wear seat belts and enroll in the pension plan , and in the end you ’ ll thank me ” ) . the criticisms of this attitude boil down to a simple question : “ Who is better equipped than I am to make choices about my welfare ? ”
but here lies the rub : if the architecture of choice is truly so important in determining outcomes , does it really matter if manipulation rather than coercion is used to make us choose what someone else has decided is ultimately good for us ? what is gained by tricking rather than forcing people into making choices they wouldn ’ t have made ?
as long as choice engineering tricks us into making choices that our own more deliberate self would make , they say , manipulation is justifiable . nudges should be so chosen as to prod us toward those choices that we ourselves would make , if we would only sit down and think carefully about the matter at hand .
is it really always so reasonable and effective to listen to System-II preferences ? according to neo-classical economists , the answer is a resounding “ yes , ” and , in many cases , they can point to substantial evidence to validate their claim .
the benefits of tax evasion may far outweigh the risk of getting caught , but imagine if everyone decided to evade taxes at the same time . in these situations , the System-II decision maker has no tools to resort to in order to escape the sub-optimality ( and social nastiness ) of the rational decision .
therefore , one of the “ nudges ” they recommend is to make organ donation as the default option in the case of a fatal accident . but there is nothing irrational in having a very strong preference not to have one ’ s body used for spare parts after one ’ s death .
ultimately , there is a fundamental and unresolved accountability deficit in the way libertarian paternalists go about nudging us . the Enlightenment idea that our System-II rationality can always point to an optimal choice about which every reasonable individual would agree clashes with the widely accepted modern idea that there is a plurality of reasonable choices .
if this is the case , who is to decide in what areas individuals can be fairly nudged by social engineers ? whose and which choices are the nudgers suppose to encourage ?
these questions , I am afraid , still await a convincing answer .
America , the Balanced
Cambridge – When the United States ’ current account fell into deficit in 1982 , the US Council of Economic Advisers accurately predicted record deficits for years to come , owing to budget deficits , a low national saving rate , and an overvalued dollar . if the US did not adjust , knowledgeable forecasters intoned , it would go from being the world ’ s largest creditor to its largest debtor .
indeed , every year for more than three decades , the US Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) has reported a current-account deficit . and yet now we must ask whether the US current-account deficit is still a problem .
for starters , the world ’ s investors declared loud and clear in 2008 that they were not concerned about the sustainability of US deficits . when the global financial crisis erupted , they flooded into dollar assets , even though the crisis originated in the United States .
moreover , a substantial amount of US adjustment has taken place since 1982 – for example , the dollar depreciations of 1985-1987 and 2002-2007 and the fiscal retrenchments of 1992-2000 and 2009-2014 . the big increase in domestic output of shale oil and gas has also helped the trade balance recently .
as a result , the US current-account deficit in 2013 had narrowed by half in dollar terms from its 2006 peak , and from 5.8 % of GDP to 2.4 % . this is a decline of two-thirds when expressed as a share of global output .
China ’ s current-account surplus peaked in 2008 at more than 10 % of GDP and has since narrowed dramatically , to 1.9 % last year . China ’ s trade adjustment in some respects followed that of Japan , the original focus of American trade anxieties in the 1980s .
I propose a third , more speculative reason why it may be time to stop worrying about the US current-account deficit . it is possible that , properly measured , the true deficits were smaller than has been reported , and even that , in some years , they were not there at all .
every year , US residents take some of what they earn in overseas investment income – interest on bonds , dividends on equities , and repatriated profits on direct investment – and reinvest it then and there . for example , corporations plow overseas profits back into their operations , often to avoid paying the high US corporate income tax implied by repatriating those earnings .
the world has long run a substantial deficit in investment income , even though the correct numbers should sum to zero . the missing income must be going somewhere .
even for officials as highly competent as those at the BEA , it is impossible to keep track of all of the stocks and flows in the international economy . everyone knows that errors and omissions are large , especially when it comes to financial transactions .
since then , some subsequent revisions have been positive and some negative . but , despite more frequent surveys of portfolio holdings in recent years , certain new asset acquisitions – for example , some held with foreign custodians – still most likely go unreported .
the reported US current-account deficits from 1982 to 2013 , based on subsequent revisions , total $ 9.5 trillion . and yet the deterioration in the US international investment position over this period was not much more than half of that amount ( $ 5.7 trillion if measured relative to the revised estimate for 1981 ) .
certainly a lot of the discrepancy is attributable to valuation effects : since 1982 , the dollar value of overseas assets has increased repeatedly , owing to increases in the dollar value of foreign currency and increases in the assets ’ foreign-currency value . but part of the discrepancy also reflects the discovery of missing assets , some of which may have originated in the reinvestment of overseas income .
for example , US multinational corporations sometimes over-invoice import bills or under-report export earnings to reduce their tax obligations . again , this would work to overstate the recorded current-account deficit .
consider an ( admittedly extreme ) illustration . if true investment income were double what is reported , the difference was reinvested abroad in the years 1982-2000 , and those assets were discovered by 2014 , that would explain about half of the upward revision in the US net international investment position .
if something like this under-reporting of reinvested earnings or other balance-of-payments credits has gone on in the past , it may still be going on today – especially with US firms becoming aggressive about arbitraging corporate income tax . and if true investment income is indeed as large as double what is reported , the true US current-account balance entered the black in 2009 and has been in surplus ever since .
trust Negotiations , Not Iran
admittedly , the country ’ s dire economic condition and its urgent need for energy made the agreement venal in a way . but North Korea ’ s decision nonetheless demonstrated the virtues and efficacy of diplomacy , which brings us once again to the case of Iran .
it is true that possessing does not mean using ; that for 15 years the world has had eight nuclear powers ; and that nuclear force has not been used since 1945 . but it is also true that Iran ’ s emergence as the ninth nuclear power would provoke a regional and global upheaval , dangerously aggravate fears and suspicions , and confront the international community with a profound crisis of vision and policy .
a nuclear strike would have incalculable consequences , and the Muslim world would in this case stand together . nor is a conventional attack possible , as Israel has no common border with Iran and most of the American army is tied down in Afghanistan and Iraq .
success would be guaranteed if the international community , especially the United States , clearly understands and admits its necessity , and supports it firmly and completely . for example , economic sanctions , to which Iran is very sensitive , could be tightened , with a commitment not to resort to military force facilitating Russian and Chinese approval .
Iran was one of the first countries to sign , and it cooperated with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) for more than 30 years – a relationship that deteriorated only in the last three years . but the current climate of mutual wariness between Iran and the self-proclaimed triad of Germany , Great Britain , and France ( with sporadic US support ) is not propitious to effective negotiations .
I cannot see how a negotiation aimed at getting Iran to renounce unilaterally a right recognized for all NPT signatories simply in order to build confidence in the West could be successful . uranium enrichment is certainly the first condition for making bombs , but the level of enrichment must reach about 95 % , compared to 3.5 % for energy production .
are the international scientific community and the IAEA really incapable of providing indicators and criteria that would allow the international community to differentiate between two types of industrial operations ? for example , forty years ago , when fear of nuclear proliferation was new , my teacher and friend Vassili Leontief , who invented the macroeconomic table of inter-industrial flows , argued that the best indicator of an illegal arms program is massive electricity consumption .
in fact , it has offered several times to accept IAEA monitoring and has suggested that its civil nuclear program would be carried out with international cooperation . so far , the West has rejected everything , on the pretext that any uranium enrichment would indicate a military program .
“ You know very well that the actual ambition of my country is to achieve regional leadership . if we had the bomb , the relationships with all our neighbors would immediately deteriorate . ”
but that should not prevent us from exploring all scenarios . if we interpret the NPT correctly , we can launch negotiations with Iran that would carefully explore the potential sincerity or not of its official stance .
Yunani Tanpa Ilusi
Athena – “ Pergantian pemerintah bersifat minor yang termahal dalam sejarah Yunani ” . pernyataan ini setidaknya merupakan satu cara menggambarkan hasil pemilihan umum Yunani pada tanggal 20 September .
meskipun persentase pemilih yang mendukung pemerintah relatif tetap , 0.6 juta dari 6.1 penduduk Yunani yang memberikan suara di referendum pada tanggal 5 Juli untuk meneruskan utang “ extend-and-pretend ” dengan syarat austerity yang ketat , tidak memilih di pemilu ini ( voters turnout ) . penurunan jumlah pemilih yang anjlok dalam waktu kurang dari dua bulan menggambarkan perubahan suasana hati pemilih secara drastis – dari penuh semangat menjadi murung .
bulan Januari lalu , ketika saya mendukung beliau , kami mengajak pemilih mendukung tekad kami mengakhiri dana talangan “ extend-and-pretend ” yang mendorong Yunani masuk ke lubang hitam dan diterapkan sebagai model kebijakan austerity di seluruh Eropa . pemerintah yang kembali berkuasa pada tanggal 20 September memiliki mandat yang berlawanan : melaksanakan program dana talangan “ extend-and-pretend ” – benar , ini merupakan perbedaan yang paling mematikan .
Tsipras paham bahwa pemerintahnya menghadapi risiko besar terkait dengan program fiskal yang tidak bisa berhasil dan agenda reformasi yang dibenci menteri-menterinya . walaupun pemilih dengan bijak memilih Tsipras dan kabinetnya , bukan oposisi yang konservatif , untuk menerapkan program yang dibenci oleh sebagian besar penduduk Yunani , kenyataan agenda austerity ini akan menguji kesabaran publik .
tiga diantaranya menyoroti rencana kenaikan pajak yang tengah ditunda : lebih dari 600.000 petani diminta membayar tunggakan pajak tambahan di tahun 2014 dan membayar di muka ( pre-pay ) sebesar lebih dari 50 % perkiraan pajak tahun mendatang . sekitar 700.000 usaha kecil ( termasuk buruh dengan upah rendah yang terpaksa bekerja sebagai penyedia jasa swasta ) harus membayar di muka 100 % pajak tahun depan ( ya , saya tidak mengada-ada ) .
selain dari kenaikan pajak yang menggelikan ini ( yang juga mencakup kenaikan pajak penjualan secara besar-besaran ) , pemerintah Tsipras telah menyetujui pemotongan pensiun dan penjualan aset-aset publik ( fire sales ) . bahkan penduduk Yunani yang paling reformis pun menolak keras agenda yang ditetapkan oleh “ tiga serangkai ” ini ( Komisi Eropa , Dana Moneter Internasional , dan Bank Sentral Eropa ) .
baris pertama adalah menekan tiga serangkai agar memenuhi janjinya untuk melakukan perundingan penghapusan utang setelah kebijakan dalam kondisi resesi ini dilaksanakan sepenuhnya . baris pertahanan kedua didasarkan pada janji adanya agenda “ paralel ” yang bertujuan untuk memperbaiki dampak terburuk dari program troika ini .
namun kreditor-kreditor asal Yunani sudah dua kali memotong rambut mereka , pertama di musim semi tahun 2012 dan selanjutnya di bulan Desember . sayangnya , meskipun potong rambut ini diperlukan , sekarang sudah terlambat , hanya sedikit , dan terlalu berbahaya sehubungan dengan parameter keuangan dan hukum mereka .
agar dapat membantu pemulihan perekonomian Yunani , penghapusan utang harus cukup besar dan menjadi pengungkit untuk menghilangkan sebagian besar upaya-upaya austerity baru , yang semata-mata memastikan terjadinya perputaran pada siklus deflasi-utang . lebih tepatnya , pengurangan utang harus disertai dengan penurunan target primary budget surplus jangka menengah , yang saat ini 3.5 % dari PDB menjadi paling banyak 1.5 % .
satu petunjuk baru muncul dalam artikel di Financial Times dimana Klaus Regling , kepala dana talangan Eropa , the European Stability Mechanism ( Mekanisme Stabilitas Eropa ) , merujuk kepada mantra troika bahwa Yunani tidak memerlukan penghapusan utang secara besar . Regling mungkin bukan pelaku utama disini karena tindakan atau upayanya , tapi ia tidak pernah bicara ketika bukan gilirannya atau menyampaikan pernyataan yang bertentangan dengan Bank Sentral Eropa dan pemerintah Jerman .
tentu saja , ada IMF , yang mana salah satu karyawannya menyampaikan kepada semua orang yang bersedia mendengarkan bahwa utang Yunani harus dihapuskan sekitar sepertiga atau € 100 miliar ( $ 112 miliar ) . tetapi jika kejadian baru-baru ini menggambarkan masa depan , maka pandangan IMF ini akan direkayasa .
ini menyisakan Tsipras dengan baris pertahanannya yang kedua : program “ paralel ” . gagasan ini bertujuan untuk menunjukkan kepada pemilih bahwa pemerintah dapat menggabungkan kapitulasi pada troika dengan agenda reformasinya sendiri , terdiri atas peningkatan efisiensi dan serangan terhadap oligarki yang dapat membebaskan dana dengan tujuan mengurangi dampak austerity terhadap Yunani yang melemah .
ini adalah proyek yang layak . jika pemerintah Yunani berhasil , proyek ini berpotensi menjadi “ game changer ” .
bagaimanapun juga , supaya upaya ini berhasil pemerintah harus membunuh dua naga sekaligus : ketidakmampuan administrasi publik Yunani dan kepandaian oligarki yang tidak ada habisnya yang tahu cara membela diri – termasuk membentuk aliansi kuat dengan troika .
tuberculosis or Hair Loss ?
Princeton – In an ideal world , the amount of money we spend on medical research to prevent or cure a disease would be proportional to its seriousness and the number of people who suffer from it . in the real world , 90 % of the money spent on medical research is focused on conditions that are responsible for just 10 % of the deaths and disability caused by diseases globally .
they cannot justify developing new drugs unless they can expect to recoup their costs through sales .
if they target diseases that affect affluent people , or people living in countries with national health insurance , they will be able to patent any new drugs they discover . for the 20 years that the patent lasts , they will have a monopoly on the drug ’ s sale and be able to command a high price .
the problem is with the system , not with the individuals who make their choices within it .
the fund would not replace existing patent laws , but would offer an alternative to them . pharmaceutical companies could continue to patent and sell their products as they do now . Alternatively , they could register a new drug with the Heath Impact Fund , which would set a low price based on the drug ’ s manufacturing cost .
instead of profiting from sales at high prices , the corporation would become eligible for a share of all payments made by the fund over the next ten years . the size of the share would be calculated by assessing the contribution the drug has made to reducing death and disability .
the most potentially lucrative targets would become the diseases that kill the most people , because that is where a breakthrough drug would have the biggest impact on global health .
Hollis and Pogge estimate that about $ 6 billion a year would be required to enable the Fund to provide a sufficient incentive for drug companies to register products that target the diseases of the poor .
it ’ s the Economy , Tunisia
Tunis – On December 21 , Tunisia completed a remarkable democratic transfer of power , with the election of Beji Caid Essebsi , the leader of the secular political party Nidaa Tounes ( Call of Tunisia ) . as with the parliamentary election in October , the process of choosing a president was , for the most part , fair and free of violence .
since the ouster of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011 , the country has endured pressures from Islamic radicals , a deterioration of its economy , and a chaotic transitional period . but it has also written and adopted a new constitution structured to encourage the separation and balance of powers , and it seems on track to pull off a successful change in government .
Tunisia is relatively homogeneous ethnically and lacks sharp sectarian divisions ; nonetheless , owing partly to its porous borders with Algeria and Libya , the specter of violence is always present . indeed , the issue of security dominated both the parliamentary and presidential elections , with all sides claiming to be the best qualified to counter extremism .
given concerns about security and the fate of the democratic transition , economic issues were essentially put on hold in both elections . now it is time for Tunisia ’ s leaders to put the economy at the top of their agenda .
the party ’ s leaders could strike a power-sharing arrangement with the moderate Islamist Ennahda party , which finished second , with 69 seats , and risk a stalemate over policy . or they could piece together a working majority from smaller political parties and try to govern in an unstable coalition beset by deep policy disagreements .
distrust of political parties and disappointment in their ability to govern is widespread , as evidenced by low voter turnout in the recent elections . Tunisia ’ s political achievements could rapidly be reversed if the new government cannot quickly revive the economy and improve citizens ’ daily lives .
in its first 30 days , the new National Assembly should publicly announce a consensus vision for economic growth and job creation . a broad multi-party commitment would likely help discipline subsequent legislative action and assist in generating the necessary public support .
in the previous assembly , work stalled on several significant pieces of legislation , including laws on public-private partnerships , foreign investment , and banking reform . the unity agenda should include early passage of these bills .
the International Monetary Fund Stand-By Arrangement of 2013 provides a similar starting point . to maintain support from the IMF when its current program ends in summer 2015 , Tunisia will need to negotiate new commitments .
the 2011 Deauville Partnership with Arab Countries in Transition , in which G-8 members pledged to support Arab countries ’ efforts to move toward “ free , democratic , and tolerant societies , ” has a role to play . this mechanism may be unlikely to mobilize significant new financing , but participating countries can provide valuable political and technical support on structural reform , regional integration , and private-sector development .
provided the security threats are contained , an early consensus within Tunisia on a credible economic agenda would open the taps of the largest potential source of capital : international financial markets . the incoming funds , and the subsequent growth and job creation , would undergird the consolidation of democracy – and thus help cement the impressive gains that Tunisia has made so far .
Turkey ’ s ISIS Crisis
since Syria ’ s civil war began three years ago , Turkey has provided logistical and financial support to virtually all elements of the Syrian opposition , while allowing them to use Turkish territory to regroup after launching military operations across the border . committed to regime change in Syria , Turkey turned a blind eye to some of these groups ’ brutal tactics , radical ideologies , and big ambitions .
Turkey fundamentally disagrees with the US in its interpretation of the threat that the Islamic State poses – and how to address it . simply put , whereas the US is approaching the Islamic State as the Middle East ’ s most pressing problem , Turkey views the group as a symptom of deeper pathologies .
according to this view , any campaign that focuses exclusively on destroying the Islamic State will do nothing to prevent the emergence of similar threats in the near future . and , unlike the US , Middle Eastern countries and their neighbors cannot decide to “ pivot ” away from the region when the consequences of their poorly designed interventions become too unruly .
as for Syria , the only plausible route to normalcy begins with forcing President Bashar al-Assad to cede power . to this end , the US and its allies should consider striking Assad ’ s strongholds in Syria , while establishing safe havens for the moderate opposition under the protective cloak of a no-fly zone .
here , Turkey , for which the establishment of safe havens is vital to accommodate Syrians who have been displaced by the conflict , could play a central role . Turkey is already bearing a heavy burden of Syrian refugees , having absorbed more than one million since the crisis began in 2011 .
following Islamic State attacks against Kurdish enclaves , more than 120,000 refugees crossed into Turkey in a single weekend . that is roughly the same number of Syrians allowed to seek refuge in the entire European Union since the crisis began in 2011 .
instead , Turkey wants to take the lead in building infrastructure that could serve the needs of Syria ’ s displaced people within the country ’ s borders . such projects would make sense only within internationally guaranteed safe havens protected by a no-fly zone .
given that the Islamic State poses a graver threat to Turkey than to any other Western country , Turkey has no choice other than to participate in the campaign against it . this means , first and foremost , adopting a zero-tolerance policy toward the Islamic State at home , aimed at preventing the group from fundraising and recruiting on Turkish soil .
but Turkey ’ s imperative to fight the Islamic State does not trump – much less invalidate – Turkish leaders ’ concerns about Obama ’ s long-term goals . if the US and Turkey are to work together to eradicate the Islamic State , they will first have to agree on a longer-term strategy for restoring some semblance of order to a crisis-ravaged region .
Turkey and Europe : two Trains on a Collision Course ?
by intervening in Lebanon , Europeans have made a far-reaching , risk-fraught , and , at the same time , correct decision . the reason is that the future of Europe ’ s security will be determined in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East .
in view of the serious risks that Europe has assumed , in full awareness of the consequences , it is of the utmost importance that a European “ Grand Strategy ” for the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East be developed , so that Europe can calmly and clearly define its interests . in any serious variation of this Grand Strategy , Turkey will need to play a central role – politically , militarily , economically , and culturally .
safeguarding Europe ’ s interests today means establishing a strong link – indeed an unbreakable bond – with Turkey as a cornerstone of regional security . so it is astonishing that Europe is doing exactly the opposite : firmly closing its eyes to the strategic challenge posed by Turkey .
successful modernization and democratization of Turkey – with a strong civil society , the rule of law , and a modern economy – will not only be hugely beneficial for Turkey , but will also export stability and serve as a model for transformation in the Islamic world . above all , the successful modernization of a large Muslim country will make a decisive contribution to Europe ’ s security .
since the days of Kemal Atatürk , the founder of modern Turkey , the modernization of Turkey has relied on its Western or European perspective . for the last 43 years , this perspective has been largely defined by Turkey ’ s interest in joining the European Union and by the EU ’ s promise of accession .
this autumn , the European Commission is scheduled to issue a progress report on accession negotiations with Turkey . a dangerous situation may well emerge , as this report threatens to derail the whole process .
when the Ankara Protocol was agreed , the government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan achieved something that , until then , had been considered impossible : he shattered the decades-old opposition of Turkish Cypriots to a compromise between the two parts of the divided island . Turkish Northern Cyprus accepted UN Secretary General Kofi Annan ’ s plan ( massively supported by the EU ) to resolve the long-standing conflict .
but this attitude is irresponsible . the EU is about to commit a grave strategic error by allowing its report this autumn to be guided by the short-sighted domestic policy considerations of some of its important member states .
Europe ’ s attitude is pushing Turkey towards forging alliances with its traditional regional rivals , Russia and Iran . these three powers , each of great importance to Europe , have been rivals for many centuries .
within Turkey , opinion polls suggest that frustration with Europe is intensifying , while Iran is viewed with increasing favor . a sense of alienation towards the West is spreading , and Turkey ’ s diplomatic relations with Russia have reached a hitherto unknown intimacy .
but to endanger this process here and now , in full awareness of the possible costs , is an act of very costly stupidity on the part of the Europeans – and stupidity is the worst sin in politics . in European-Turkish relations , two trains are racing headlong towards each other .
Turkey ’ s Quagmire
Tel AVIV – As the Islamic State militant group has advanced across Iraq and Syria , traditional regional alliances , long shaped by Western powers , have been upended . particularly consequential is Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ’ s struggle to reconcile his country ’ s relationship with NATO with its image as a leading protector of Sunni Islam .
the Turkish government ’ s reluctance to join the United States-led coalition against the Islamic State ’ s extremist Sunni fighters has isolated it from other Sunni Arab powers , such as Saudi Arabia , that have joined the coalition . moreover , it has further alienated Turkey ’ s Iranian allies , already estranged by Erdoğan ’ s obsession with toppling their man in Damascus , Bashar al-Assad .
Erdoğan ’ s supporters dismiss Western campaigns against Islamist terrorism as a ploy to repress Sunnis . as one such supporter , Kenan Alpay , &amp; nbsp ; recently wrote , “ Turkey cannot be a part of an international system that aims to dissolve all Islamic movements from the Muslim Brotherhood to &amp; hellip ; the Taliban in Afghanistan . ”
the similarities with the views of the Islamic State are glaring . in a video produced after the battle for the Mosul Dam in August , the group called for the “ end of Sykes-Picot , ” and proclaimed the need to redraw the Western-imposed political map of the Middle East .
Erdoğan ’ s ambition to restore Turkey ’ s primacy in the Sunni world is driving him to collude with this challenge to the Western-devised regional order . indeed , Turkey has been offering logistical support to the Islamic State , even as it has enabled the group ’ s murderous members to massacre thousands of civilian Kurds and Yazidis in the Syrian town of Kobani on Turkey ’ s doorstep .
this highlights another issue on which Turkey and the Islamic State converge : the Kurds . Erdoğan seems to hope that , by degrading Kurdish military strength and territorial control , the Islamic State will help him to achieve his central goal of diminishing the Kurdish nationalist movement , which has long been a thorn in Turkey ’ s side .
the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in Iraq have already established a quasi-independent state along the border with Turkey . and the Democratic Union Party – the Syrian affiliate of the Kurdistan Workers ’ Party ( PKK ) , which has been fighting a guerrilla war against the Turkish state for the last three decades – is on its way toward establishing a Kurdish autonomous region along Turkey ’ s Syrian border .
and there is more bad news for Erdoğan . the perception that his true objective in supporting the Islamic State is to stem the rise of the Kurds , bolstered by his apparent indifference to the agony in Kobani , has jeopardized one of his major legacies : peace talks with the PKK .
after all , Erdoğan ’ s anti-Kurdish sentiment also shaped his policy decisions concerning regime change in Syria . he has long insisted on the creation of a no-fly “ buffer ” zone on the Syrian side of the border , under the pretext that it would help to address the humanitarian crisis that the civil war has engendered .
if his position on the Islamic State continues to waver , he will only alienate the Kurds further , which means that when the jihadists decide to encroach on Turkish territory , Turkey will have to confront them without a Kurdish alliance . but if he decides to support the Kurds in their fight against the Islamic State , he will undoubtedly enhance their national aspirations .
but stronger Kurdish nationalism might not be such a bad thing for Erdoğan , who has been a vociferous advocate of the right of national self-determination beyond Turkey ’ s immediate vicinity , such as in the case of Palestine . indeed , such a move could be a welcome sign of political and moral consistency , possibly even boosting Erdoğan ’ s leverage in devising an arrangement with Turkey ’ s Kurds , including the PKK .
in any case , it is time for Erdoğan to make a choice . he has already led Turkey into a thicket of clashes among its vital interests : its Western alliance , its regional aspirations , and the Kurdish question .
Turkey , Armenia , and the Burden of Memory
but memories of atrocity never seem to fade , as the government-fanned anti-Japanese riots now taking place in China remind us . the 90th anniversary of the Armenian massacres of 1915 , ordered by the ruling Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire and carried out with the help of the Kurds , is another wound that will not heal , but one that must be treated if Turkey ’ s progress toward European Union membership is to proceed smoothly .
it is believed that the Armenian genocide inspired the Nazis in their plans for the extermination of Jews . however , in comparison with the Holocaust , most people still know little about this dark episode .
indeed , it is hard for most of us to imagine the scale of suffering and devastation inflicted on the Armenian people and their ancestral homelands . but many members of today ’ s thriving global Armenian Diaspora have direct ancestors who perished , and carry an oral historical tradition that keeps the memories burning .
it is particularly ironic that many Kurds from Turkey ’ s southeastern provinces , having been promised Armenian property and a guaranteed place in heaven for killing infidels , were willingly complicit in the genocide . they later found themselves on the losing end of a long history of violence between their own separatist forces and the Turkish army , as well as being subjected to an ongoing policy of discrimination and forced assimilation .
historically , the ancient Christian Armenians were amongst the most progressive people in the East , but in the nineteenth century Armenia was divided between the Ottoman Empire and Russia . Sultan Abdulhamit II organized the massacres of 1895-97 but it was not until the spring of 1915 , under the cover of the First World War , that the Young Turks ’ nationalistic government found the political will to execute a true genocide .
ordinary Armenians were thus deprived of their leaders , and soon after were massacred , with many burned alive . approximately 500,000 were killed in the last seven months of 1915 , with the majority of the survivors deported to desert areas in Syria , where they died from either starvation or disease .
recently , the Armenian Diaspora has been calling on Turkey to face-up to its past and recognize its historic crime . Turkey ’ s official line remains that the allegation is based on unfounded or exaggerated claims , and that the deaths that occurred resulted from combat against Armenians collaborating with invading Russian forces during the First World War , or as a result of disease and hunger during the forced deportations .
Turkey thus argues that the charge of genocide is designed to besmirch Turkey ’ s honor and impede its progress towards EU accession . there are also understandable fears that diverging from the official line would trigger a flood of compensation claims , as occurred against Germany .
even Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , under increasing EU pressure as accession negotiations are due to begin this October , has agreed to an impartial study by academic historians , although he has reiterated his belief that the genocide never occurred . in France , the historical occurrence of the Armenian genocide is enshrined in law , and denial of its occurrence is regarded in the same way as Holocaust denial .
the European Parliament is pressing for Turkish recognition of the Armenian genocide . it is also calling for an end to the trade embargo by Turkey and its close ally Azerbaijan against the Republic of Armenia , a reopening of frontiers , and a land-for-peace deal to resolve the territorial dispute over Nagorno Karabakh in Azerbaijan and safeguard its Armenian identity .
Armenia , an independent country since 1991 , remains dependent on continued Russian protection , as was the case in 1920 when it joined the Soviet Union rather than suffer further Turkish invasion . this is not healthy for the development of Armenia ’ s democracy and weak economy .
there is only one way forward for Turkey , Armenia , and the region . the future will begin only when Turkey – like Germany in the past and Serbia and Croatia now – repudiates its policy of denial and faces up to its terrible crimes of 1915 .
narrative Power in Turkey
Istanbul – At the end of March , a retrial finally resulted in the acquittal of more than 200 Turkish military officers who had been convicted of plotting a coup in 2003 against the then-newly elected Islamist government . the defendants had been given long prison sentences after the first trial concluded in September 2012 , even though the evidence against them was clearly forged .
liberal intellectuals and Western observers applauded the prosecution and hailed it as one of the greatest achievements of the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , who had since come to power . now that the case has been shown for what it was – a thuggish government ’ s attempt to weaken its rivals and consolidate its hold on power – the question is why so many well-intentioned observers got their analysis so terribly wrong .
my father-in-law was the alleged mastermind of the Sledgehammer plot , so my wife and I found ourselves moonlighting as forensic detectives and political activists . in my five years investigating this bizarre saga , I learned to appreciate the power of narratives .
the Gülen movement oversaw Sledgehammer and similar trials via its followers in the police and the judiciary , and used its extensive media outlets to craft and disseminate the narrative – built from countless stories of military plots and other malfeasance – on which these cases rested . its representatives in the United States and Europe lobbied Western politicians and opinion leaders incessantly to vouch for Erdoğan ’ s democratic credentials .
at the same time , the Gülen movement invested heavily and shrewdly in cultivating Turkey ’ s Western-oriented intelligentsia . thus , despite Gülen ’ s own embarrassing history of anti-Semitic and anti-Western sermons , his followers managed to establish themselves by the 2000s as a civil-society movement that shared Turkish liberals ’ values and aspirations .
Gülenists provided resources and networks to Turkey ’ s liberals , who then lent the movement legitimacy and credibility in the West . when American and European politicians , reporters , and human rights specialists looked for insight on Turkey , they turned to the Gülenists ’ liberal beneficiaries , who fed them the established narratives .
what made these intellectuals willing allies of Erdoğan and the Gülenists was their view that the military ’ s control of state institutions – “ military tutelage ” – posed the greatest obstacle to democracy in Turkey . for Turkey ’ s liberals , the weakening of the military ’ s political influence became an end in itself .
the Erdoğan government adopted legislation that lent credence to its false narrative . the European Commission looked with approval on a succession of initiatives – a new penal code adopting “ modern European standards , ” training programs on the European Convention of Human Rights , expert missions from the European Union , and constitutional amendments seemingly guaranteeing much greater judicial independence .
unfortunately , as in development economics , mimicking advanced-country regulations and institutions rarely produces the desired results . form does not guarantee function .
so it was with the Erdoğan government ’ s “ pro-European ” reforms , which served mainly to provide political cover for strengthening the Gülenists ’ hold over the judiciary . fooled by appearances , the European Commission continued to assert , year after year , that the military show trials were an opportunity to strengthen the rule of law .
until recently , the military was widely regarded as Turkish society ’ s most powerful and cohesive institution . the generals had never been shy about intervening in politics when they felt it necessary .
the Sledgehammer case and other allegations , false as they were , immobilized the military . under intense attack by pro-government media , the general staff failed to mount even the slightest public effort on the accused officers ’ behalf , even refusing to release an internal report that left no doubt that the defendants had been framed .
Western observers and the bulk of domestic liberals did not give up on Erdoğan until his government ’ s heavy-handed tactics during the Gezi Park protests in Istanbul in the summer of 2013 . he then broke clumsily with the Gülen movement after its acolytes in the judiciary launched a corruption probe against him and his inner circle .
without his Gülenist allies , Erdoğan ’ s message has become oriented exclusively to a domestic audience , and features heavy doses of populist-religious-nationalist symbolism . meanwhile , the Gülenists , ever in search of the narrative upper hand , have been presenting themselves to Western audiences as Erdoğan ’ s victims rather than as his collaborators .
false narratives eventually become unsustainable ( with the Internet and social media hastening their demise ) . but , as in Turkey , a collapsed narrative can leave much debris .
the EU ’ s Turkish Opening
Madrid ‒ June ’ s Turkish general election sent a powerful message : Turkey ’ s democracy remains intact . indeed , while there were some grievances about transparency during the campaign process , democracy prevailed , with a stunning 86 % of eligible voters turning out – a rate rarely seen in Europe .
indeed , as regional conflicts have intensified , the country ’ s central foreign-policy objective of ensuring “ zero problems ” with its neighbors has become unattainable . and the policies that Turkey has pursued , most notably toward Syria and Egypt , have satisfied neither the region ’ s Sunni-majority countries nor the West .
perhaps more important , the AKP government ’ s foreign policy has faced considerable criticism from domestic forces , which now have more power to change it – an outcome that will occur regardless of whether the AKP ultimately forms a coalition or a minority government . the direction of change will have to account for the various parties ’ preferred approaches .
the secular , center-left Republican People ’ s Party , for example , opposes interference in the internal affairs of any country , advocating instead that Turkey re-establish good relations with the countries of the region , including Syria . by contrast , the HDP protested against the previous AKP government ’ s failure to intervene last year when the Islamic State besieged the Syrian city of Kobane .
for its part , the rightist Nationalist Movement Party criticizes the AKP administration ’ s decision to denounce the current Egyptian government , arguing that the move has all but eliminated Turkey ’ s influence in the country . now , the party asserts , Turkey should work to defend its regional neighbors ’ territorial integrity .
indeed , as a regional power , it has a responsibility to work to ease tensions and promote conflict resolution . it also has a long-term national interest in increased regional stability , not least because it would help to stem the tide of refugees – already numbering two million – flowing into the country , while opening up more commercial opportunities nearby .
Turkey ’ s democratic revival represents an ideal opportunity for the EU to rekindle its relations with the country . the EU is Turkey ’ s leading trade partner and one of its largest investors , and has long considered Turkey to be a stable ally in a volatile region .
the EU could , for example , provide diplomatic support in Turkey ’ s dealings with its neighbors and humanitarian aid to help refugees . given that a more stable Middle East would send fewer refugees and terrorists across its borders , Europe has a strong incentive to provide such support .
after all , given broad resistance to any further EU enlargement at the moment , the accession process will undoubtedly move very slowly . the objective should thus be to find new , more efficient modes of cooperation that avoid the issues and conflicts that have impeded accession negotiations .
this is not to say that the accession process should be abandoned . rather , other more efficient channels of cooperation should be opened up in parallel to it .
European leaders should also carefully monitor the possible revision of Turkish foreign policy , grasping opportunities to reignite bilateral dialogue on issues of common interest . this will require subsequent high-level meetings at regular intervals , in order to produce agreement regarding specific joint actions on urgent challenges .
this is a moment of opportunity for EU-Turkey relations , and it must be seized . achieving the goal of enhanced stability in the Middle East requires the two sides to work together .
Turkey , Europe and Middle-East Security
many factors contributed to the French and Dutch objections to the proposed EU Constitution . one – usually unstated – factor is a fear of Turkish membership in the Union .
Turkey ’ s bureaucrats , politicians , and citizens united to fulfill the Copenhagen criteria for EU membership and tolerated the pain of the IMF-directed structural-adjustment programs . the looming accession process will be even more painful , but Turkey ’ s people are firmly resolved to face this challenge .
Turkey ’ s transformation has already put an end to the Cold War-style security-state apparatus that ruled the country for half a century , and has changed the framework of the country ’ s domestic and foreign policy . by modernizing and democratizing at home , Turkey ’ s politicians gained self-confidence in their ability to conduct a successful regional policy .
this influence does not imply a hegemonic relationship , but rather points to an alternative path for reform and economic development that other primarily Muslim countries might take . the EU is associated with peace , democracy , and economic development , while the Middle East is characterized by instability , authoritarianism , and economic backwardness .
Turkey also shows that the supposed clash between democracy and security – and , indeed , between democracy and Islam – can be reconciled . other Muslim states seem to grasp this : recently , a Turk was chosen for the first time and by a majority vote to be Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Countries .
Turkey ’ s other major contribution comes through constructive diplomatic engagement in the region . the Turkish government has adopted an active role as a promoter of peace and has reconfigured its policies toward a number of regional problems .
for example , Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan broke with tradition by displaying a critical attitude toward Israel ’ s more hawkish policies in the occupied territories , and did so without severing diplomatic relations with Israel . during a visit of Turkey ’ s Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul to Israel in early January , there was serious discussion about Turkey assuming a mediating role between Israel and the Palestinians , as well as in future Syrian-Israeli talks .
Turkey , of course , did not join the US-led occupation forces in Iraq , but it has put enormous effort into mobilizing regional support for a stable Iraqi state . indeed , Turkish policymakers have , on a regular basis , brought the countries bordering Iraq together for discussions about the future of the region .
Turkey ’ s constructive engagement with the EU creates a sense of trust in the West – among Western leaders at least , if not yet the general population -- for its regional initiatives . yet Turkey is also succeeding in keeping an equal distance between both the EU and the US .
in recent history , a variety of regional powers – the Shah ’ s Iran and Nasser ’ s Egypt – have arisen in the Middle East . Turkey ’ s arrival as a regional power is different in that its democratic structures make an active peacemaker , not a local bully .
this is both a necessary and a promising role , for the region needs a local dynamic force pushing for reform , transformation , and peace . Turkey ’ s experience shows that true security in the region requires internal stability and social peace .
Turkey ’ s Diplomatic Dogfight
the action plan and Merkel ’ s visit were viewed within Turkey as de facto endorsements of Erdoğan ; the EU even delayed the release of a critical “ progress report ” on Turkey ’ s accession negotiations until after the vote . in the end , Erdoğan ’ s Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) regained its comfortable parliamentary majority .
the G-20 Summit in Antalya , held on November 15-16 , was to cement Erdoğan ’ s triumphant return to the world stage , ending a period of relative isolation by the West that reflected disapproval of his authoritarian tendencies . and a joint EU-Turkey summit was scheduled for November 29 to formalize the action plan .
the tragedy in Paris sidelined Turkey at its own summit , derailing Erdoğan ’ s international comeback . instead , the focus was on US President Barack Obama , Putin , and French President François Hollande acting from Paris .
now , Erdoğan faces a different strategic outlook , particularly with Russia-Turkey relations under greater strain than at any time since the Cold War ’ s end . with the world now more determined than ever to defeat the Islamic State – an enterprise that will , it is becoming clear , require boots on the ground – the major powers are seeking immediately available forces .
meanwhile , Turkey faces a direct threat from the Islamic State , exemplified by the twin suicide bombings that killed more than 100 people in Ankara last month . Turkish authorities have since foiled another attack , planned for the same day as those in Paris .
as France shuns NATO as the centerpiece of an international response to the Islamic State , Turkey ’ s zero-tolerance approach to encroachments on its airspace has put NATO-Russian relations under dangerous strain . it is in easing those tensions that the EU has an important role to play .
while Turkey still has leverage vis-à-vis the EU , owing to the continued flow of refugees toward Europe , both sides are now approaching the partnership from positions of genuine need . neither side can afford further complication of the already volatile situation .
this means establishing credible safeguards to prevent potential safe zones in northern Syria , essential to stemming refugee flows and beginning to stabilize the country , from threatening Turkey ’ s internal security . European leaders – along with the US – must weigh in to avoid an escalation between Turkey and Russia .
the developments on its southern border concern far more than the Kurdish question ; they have far-reaching implications for regional stability . the AKP ’ s election victory offers a chance for the government to shift its attention back toward resolving the broader problems in its neighborhood – that is , to act like a true regional leader , instead of pursuing a narrow , self-serving agenda .
to address today ’ s most urgent challenges , Turkey and the EU must commit to building a genuine partnership , based on common interests , in particular security interests , rather than a transactional arrangement that addresses issues à la carte . this necessarily includes a good-faith approach to negotiations on Turkey ’ s accession to the EU .
in the wake of Turkey ’ s fraying relations with Russia , the decision to proceed with the planned EU-Turkey Summit is an important one .
Turkey ’ s Politics of Peace
at its core , this process is about redefining the secular , unitary state created in 1923 . everyone in the new republic who was not explicitly defined as a member of an officially recognized minority was supposed to merge into a new Turkish identity .
Kurds held fast to their own ethnic identity . eventually , the suppression of the Kurdish language and culture fueled a brutal insurgency , led by the Kurdish Workers ’ Party ( PKK ) which has cost the country more than 30,000 lives .
it is to the great credit of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that he had the courage to launch an open peace process with the PKK in 2013 . since then , that process has made progress that seemed unthinkable only a few years ago .
a comprehensive settlement of the Kurdish issue within Turkey will be key to the country ’ s stability and the future of its bid for accession to the European Union . otherwise , one can envisage scenarios in which the forces of disintegration now roiling the neighboring Levant actually spread into Turkey itself , with unimaginable consequences .
a high priority for any new government in Turkey should be to complete the peace process that Erdoğan began . and Erdoğan should understand that his legacy might well be shaped by whether that process succeeds or fails .
the second peace process at stake is the new attempt to unify Cyprus , which has been divided since its constitutional breakdown in 1963 and Turkey ’ s invasion in 1974 . indeed , it is bizarre that the capital of an EU member country is divided by a dead zone patrolled for decades by United Nations peacekeeping troops .
the continued division of Cyprus is blocking both the EU accession talks with Turkey and increasingly necessary cooperation between the EU and NATO . but now , under President Nicos Anastasiades and the newly elected president of Northern Cyprus , Mustafa Akinci , there is a real possibility , after years of stalemate , of reaching a settlement that can re-unify the island .
but a settlement will not be possible without the clear support of the Turkish government . the new administration ’ s stance will thus be critical : Turkey has much to gain by supporting a solution in Cyprus ; but it could also revert to old habits and spoil today ’ s unique opportunity .
the third peace process in play concerns Turkey ’ s relationship with Armenia , which , if improved , could help create the conditions for a peace settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan . a far-sighted agreement was signed by Armenia and Turkey in Zürich in October 2009 ; but wider regional forces eventually blocked progress , with Russian intervention decisive .
maintaining the frozen conflict with Armenia is not in the long-term interests of Turkey or any other state in the region . the ongoing blockades and military face-offs could , at some point , lead to violent upheaval in the southern Caucasus , with very negative effects for Turkey .
Turkey has taken a principled and strong stand against President Bashar al-Assad ’ s regime , and has generously taken in more than a million refugees . but the dangers posed by the ongoing conflict , particularly the strains on Turkey itself , should not be underestimated .
a complete collapse , fueled by efforts to impose a political solution by military means , would most likely lead to catastrophic consequences for decades to come , with Turkey among the worst affected . so Turkey ’ s new administration should be ready to engage in a constructive dialogue , together with the United States and Iran , on possible solutions .
otherwise , a fresh election – and thus fresh political uncertainty – will be unavoidable . that is why Turkey ’ s friends should take this opportunity to remind the country ’ s leaders of what is at stake – for Turkey itself , as well as for peace in the region .
Turkey ’ s Balancing Act
East LANSING , MICHIGAN – Turkey has over the past few weeks become the spearhead of a joint Western-Arab-Turkish policy aimed at forcing President Bashar al-Assad to cede power in Syria . this is quite a turnaround in Turkish policy , because over the past two years the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had gone out of its way to cultivate good relations with neighboring Syria , with whom it shares a long land border .
this change of course on Syria has also cost Turkey a great deal in terms of its relations with Iran , the principal supporter of Assad ’ s regime , which Turkey had also cultivated as part of Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu ’ s “ zero problems with neighbors ” policy .
given these new strains , it is worth recalling that a only few months ago many American leaders were livid at what they perceived to be Turkey ’ s betrayal . in their view , Turkey had re-oriented its foreign policy toward the Muslim Middle East and away from the West – a shift supposedly reflected in the country ’ s deteriorating relations with Israel and improving ties with Iran and Syria .
Turkey ’ s attempt to mediate between the major Western powers and Iran concerning the Islamic Republic ’ s uranium stockpile went unappreciated in the West ; indeed , the United States scuttled the effort just as it seemed to be bearing fruit . and Turkey ’ s subsequent vote in the United Nations Security Council against imposing additional sanctions on Iran seemed to offer further proof that Turkey had adopted an “ Islamic ” foreign policy .
Turkey , on the other hand , after some initial hesitation , has thrown its weight fully behind Assad ’ s opponents , including by providing refuge to them , as well as to defectors from Syria ’ s army . indeed , Turkey has gone further by helping the divided Syrian opposition to come together on its territory to establish a joint front against the Assad regime and provide a credible alternative to it .
Iran ’ s displeasure at Turkey ’ s “ betrayal ” of Assad was compounded by the Erdoğan government ’ s recent decision to install a NATO anti-missile early-warning facility – aimed at tracking Iranian missile activity – in Malatya in eastern Turkey . according to Iranian authorities , NATO ’ s system is designed to neutralize Iran ’ s deterrent capacity vis-à-vis Israel , thereby increasing the likelihood of an Israeli or US strike against Iranian nuclear facilities .
in reality , Israel can track Iranian missile activity from several sites other than Malatya . Iran ’ s threat , therefore , is an expression more of discontent with Turkey than of genuine concern that the Malatya facility will adversely affect its deterrent capacity .
this does not mean that Turkey will return to its traditional strategic dependence on the US and its allies , an approach that defined Turkish foreign policy throughout the Cold War and the decade following it . the AKP government is committed to the country ’ s strategic autonomy and to greater activism in the Middle East .
Turkey is engaged in an intricate effort to preserve its old relationship with the West while building new ties with its Muslim neighbors . Turkey ’ s leaders understand that the country can best preserve and enhance its leverage with both sides by maintaining good relations with each .
Turkey ’ s Choice
the party will be able to form a government by itself , but will lack the two-thirds majority needed to bring about some of the big changes that it seeks . still , the AKP can be satisfied that after five years in office its popular support has climbed , while the opposition has been shown to be incapable of challenging it seriously .
the AKP ’ s resounding victory means that the Turkish republic originally shaped as a secular state by Kemal Ataturk in the 1920 ’ s is dead . however , this does not necessarily mean that Turkey will become an Islamic , must less an Islamist , country .
for Ataturk , Westernization and modernization went hand in hand . and , indeed , Turkey achieved great success – arguably more than any other Muslim-majority state in the world – in building democracy , maintaining stability , and moving forward economically .
a key factor was the increasing prominence and power of more traditional sections of the population from central Anatolia , where many small businesses grew big , enriching a more Islamic-oriented middle class . at the same time , millions of people emigrated from villages to cities , becoming mobilized and politicized as a result .
they successfully reconciled Islamic politics with the Turkish lifestyle and modernity in general . cleverly , they positioned the party as conservative rather than Islamist – a process aided by the corruption , bickering , and incompetence of the existing parties .
indeed , while the socialist left survived by uniting around the CHP , the conservative parties that largely dominated Turkish politics for a quarter-century fell apart . unwilling to change or work together , and unable to devise ways of appealing to voters , these once-powerful groups simply disappeared , leaving the AKP largely in control of the conservative electoral base .
the election ’ s other success story was the MHP , which has often been seen as a neo-fascist party since its creation immediately after World War II , but which has been reinventing itself along conservative nationalist lines . the fact that two-thirds of the voters supported parties that were long considered extremist and whose allegiance to democracy is questionable has shocked many Turks , including those who comprised most of the ruling elite in modern times .
first , what does the AKP want ? is it a conservative party of good government that seeks equality for Islam in the public sphere , as its leaders usually suggest , or an Islamist wolf in moderate sheep ’ s clothing , as its enemies fear ?
the AKP contains people with both views . moreover , it might be that the party will push as far as it can until it is stopped by fear of a military coup or a rejection of its program by the voters .
that leads to the second question : how far can the AKP go in changing Turkish society ?
the problem is that unless there is a viable opposition , the only check on the AKP will be its own conscience and a crackdown by the still secular-oriented armed forces . but , as part of its seemingly endless effort to get into the European Union – an aspiration that seems all but doomed at present – Turkey implemented reforms that undercut the military ’ s political role .
the president names the head of the armed forces , a power that could potentially turn the military into a servant of the government . given that the government can change laws , name judges , and staff the state administration , Turkey ’ s slide to another political model could reach a point of no return .
if such a model means a Turkey that is more willing to embrace its traditional and religious heritage , the outcome would be relatively benign for most of its citizens as well as its strategic alliances . but if it means a more anti-Western Turkey increasingly oriented toward Iran , Syria , and radical Islamist movements , a major shift in international politics would be accompanied by mounting domestic instability .
Turkey ’ s Democratic Dusk
Cambridge – When questioned recently about a constitutional law professor who was arrested for lecturing at an institute run by the country ’ s main pro-Kurdish political party , Turkey ’ s interior minister , Idris Naim Sahin , couldn ’ t hide his irritation : “ I am having a hard time understanding those saying a professor should not be arrested while thousands of other people are being arrested in Turkey . ”
presumably , Sahin meant to say that a professor cannot claim special treatment under the law . but his remark inadvertently underscored Turkey ’ s new reality , in which any perceived opponent of the current regime can be jailed , with or without evidence , for terrorism or other violent acts .
special courts , tasked with prosecuting terrorism and crimes against the state , have been working overtime to produce charges that are often as absurd as they are baseless . for example , journalists have been imprisoned for producing articles and books at the behest of an alleged terrorist organization called “ Ergenekon , ” whose existence has yet to be confirmed , despite years of investigation .
a senior police commissioner is currently languishing in jail for allegedly collaborating with far-left militants he spent his entire career hunting down . these prosecutions have cast an ever-widening net , ensnaring scores of journalists , authors , and academics , hundreds of military officers , and thousands of Kurdish politicians and activists , among others .
and government control now extends beyond the media , judiciary , and academia to the worlds of business and sports . previously autonomous regulatory bodies ( such as the competition authority ) have been quietly subordinated to the government , with no debate or discussion .
even the Turkish Academy of Sciences has been targeted . a recent decree , widely condemned abroad , allows the government to appoint two-thirds of the Academy ’ s members , thereby ending even the semblance of scientific independence .
his success at expanding access to health , education , and housing has enabled him to win three general elections – each with a greater share of the popular vote than previously . he has broken the power of the military old guard and the hold of its stale Kemalist ideology – the secular nationalism introduced by Turkey ’ s first president , Mustafa Kemal Atatürk – thereby permanently altering the makeup of Turkish politics .
members of the transnational Gülen movement – inspired by followers of Fethullah Gülen , a Pennsylvania-based Muslim theologian – are staffing Turkey ’ s police , judiciary , bureaucracy , and universities . the Gülenist media now set the country ’ s new ideological tone , producing a steady stream of disinformation in their vocal support of the country ’ s show trials .
prominent detainees , such as the journalist Nedim Sener and police commissioner Hanefi Avci , landed in jail after exposing the wrongdoings of Gülenist police and prosecutors . editorials in Zaman , the Gülen network ’ s Turkish-language daily newspaper , no longer mince words : a new Turkey is being created ; those who stand in the way are getting what they deserve .
but , as the charges have increased in scope and implausibility , the trials have complicated his relationships with the military , domestic liberals , and outsiders such as foreign media and the European Union . moreover , individuals close to him and his administration have recently become entangled in the net of judicial manipulation , which suggests that he may be losing control over the police and the special courts .
given that the fight against the common enemy , the secularist old guard , has been decisively won , an eventual break between Erdoğan and the Gülenists is perhaps inevitable . unfortunately , regardless of which side emerges victorious , the outcome will not be good news for Turkish democracy .
it wasn ’ t long ago that Turkey appeared to be a bright beacon of democracy and moderation in a region accustomed to autocracy and radicalism . now it looks more like a country heading towards authoritarianism at home and embracing adventurism abroad .
but playing Erdoğan ’ s game only reinforces his sense of invincibility . it does not advance the cause of democracy in Turkey ; nor does it make Turkey a more reliable ally .
will Turkey Weather the Middle East Storm ?
its center has shifted from Iraq ( where sectarian strife has recently escalated again ) to Syria , but it encompasses Egypt , Yemen , Libya , and Tunisia as well . farther east , Afghanistan is suffering its second decade of violent conflict , while Pakistan seems to be chronically on the brink of war , civil war , or social breakdown .
likewise , pious conservatives and liberal and leftist secular youth , who joined forces in Cairo and Tunis in 2010-2011 to challenge the dictators , have now turned on each other : witness the Egyptian security forces ’ appalling massacres of Islamist demonstrators in Cairo recently , following a military coup carried out with liberals ’ support . the region ’ s people are sliding into enemy camps , deepening their societies ’ wounds in the process .
I have often argued that Turkey should not intervene in the internal affairs of its neighbors or adopt a Middle East-centered policy . both government and opposition should remain steadfastly focused on Europe , despite the obstacles that the European Union has placed in Turkey ’ s way during membership negotiations .
the Arab world ’ s pain is acutely felt , owing to Turkey ’ s historical , religious , and emotional bonds with these countries . moreover , economic ties and sheer proximity mean that Turkey ’ s prosperity depends , to some degree at least , on that of the Middle East .
in recent years , there was hope that Turkey could help by serving as a model of a successful economy and well-functioning democracy ; but recent events have raised doubts . in fact , Turkey must overcome four sources of internal tension if it is to continue to thrive economically , consolidate its democracy , and act as a compelling example to others .
the first and most serious source of tension stems from the need to recognize Kurdish identity as a fully legitimate part of the Turkish Republic . those who wish to express a Kurdish identity , as well as all other citizens , must be confident that , while all remain committed to national unity , Turkey is a country in which diversity can thrive .
second , there is an underlying historical tension between the large Sunni majority and the Alevi-Bektashi minority , loosely linked to Shia Islam .
third , there is the difference between those who adhere to the tradition of political Islam and those who uphold the strict secularism that came with the republic . often this social “ divide ” intersects with the Sunni-Alevi cleavage , as the Alevis have increasingly aligned themselves with the political left .
but these reforms have been rolled back recently , with independent regulatory authorities again coming under the control of government ministries ( though it seems that the central bank has retained much of its autonomy ) . as the perception of non-partisanship in public administration has diminished , proximity to those in power has become another source of tension .
Turkey benefits from republican reflexes and values that have been built over decades , as well as from humanist wisdom anchored in centuries of history . yet , given the regional context , Turkey ’ s internal tensions now represent a serious threat .
respect for diversity and individual freedom , and concern for generating growth and jobs in an atmosphere of social peace , must be guiding principles . healing the wounds to which all sides have at times contributed , and practicing forgiveness , should be the order of the day .
Turkey must look carefully at the catastrophe unfolding around it in the Middle East . humanitarian help is necessary , and Turkey is providing it generously , in ways that should serve as an example for Western countries .
others will not protect Turkey ; some may even promote strife within its borders ( historical examples of such tactics abound ) . Turkey alone can protect itself , and only by upholding truly democratic behavior at home and pursuing an external policy that promotes peace and democracy but does not take sides in the region ’ s ongoing battles , particularly between Sunni and Shia .
the Gezi Park demonstrators who in June protested peacefully against the use of excessive police force by simply standing still also protested peacefully , years ago , against the ban on the headscarf then in effect in Turkey ’ s universities . this kind of concern for the rights of all is a hallmark of Turkey ’ s young generation .
similarly , when the outgoing governor of Van sent a farewell message last month to the largely Kurdish-speaking people in his southeastern province , he delivered it in Kurdish – and received warm wishes in return .
a large majority of Turkey ’ s citizens share such generosity of spirit . that is why , despite serious difficulties , Turkey has a good chance of overcoming its internal tensions and becoming the example that its Middle East neighbors ( and perhaps a few of its European neighbors as well ) so desperately need .
Turkey ’ s Middle Eastern Road to Europe
Istanbul – Just a few years ago , Europe headed Turkey ’ s agenda . Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ’ s newly elected government had embarked on a series of ambitious reforms to meet the European Union ’ s political criteria for membership .
but pro-European euphoria proved short-lived : for all practical purposes , the accession negotiations are now at an impasse . Euro-skepticism is now at an all-time high in Turkey , fueled by some European political leaders ’ rhetoric opposing Turkey ’ s accession , and by the EU ’ s own failure to dispel doubts about the feasibility of Turkey ’ s eventual membership .
not surprisingly , Turkey ’ s government has also lost its appetite for EU-related reforms . for more than two years , the European Commission has found little positive to say in its annual progress reports on political reform .
the frustrations of dealing with an undecided Europe have led Turkish policymakers to focus their efforts on an area where the expected return on their investment is more immediate and more concrete . in fact , whereas Erdoğan recently visited many Middle East countries – Syria , Lebanon , Egypt , Algeria , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , Iran , and Iraq – until this month , he had not been to Brussels since 2005 .
Turkey was traditionally a bystander in Middle East politics . its leaders believed that there was little to be contributed or gained by getting involved in the region ’ s problems , and that Turkey ’ s Ottoman legacy would leave its Arab neighbors suspicious .
Turkey was instrumental in bringing about an end to Lebanon ’ s factional strife , and its overtures to Syria – undertaken despite warnings from the United States – have paid off handsomely . Turkey was able not only to defuse the international tensions surrounding its Arab neighbor , but also to engineer the start of direct talks between Syria and Israel .
such activism has been even more pronounced concerning Iran , with Turkish leaders multiplying diplomatic efforts in recent months to help ease the nuclear standoff with the West . Turkey , more fearful of the regional repercussions of a nuclear Iran than of any direct threat it would pose , went as far as to host a visit by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad last August .
Turkey ’ s ability to make headway in the Middle East reflects the erosion of US legitimacy and lack of EU influence . the US lost its ability to play a more constructive role in the region following its ill-fated intervention in Iraq , while the Bush administration ’ s neo-conservative “ freedom agenda ” for the Arab world also backfired .
unlike the US , the EU ’ s difficulties stem not from a perceived lack of legitimacy or crude attempts at promoting democracy , but from a real lack of unity and , therefore , influence . the absence of a common denominator among EU governments ’ positions has hardly been conducive to the emergence of the cogent and reliable diplomacy needed to address the Middle East ’ s deep problems .
in these circumstances , Turkey has been able to leverage both its regional ties and its standing in the transatlantic community to play a more instrumental role vis-à-vis its southern neighbors .
first , the rise of an Arab political class that is more influenced by religion than by secular nationalism has eroded the main structural barrier to Turkish engagement . the Ottoman legacy of a working state structure , tolerant of religion , has begun to be viewed in a more favorable light , and the contemporary Turkish model , with its ability to nurture a democracy-friendly Islam , is suddenly in demand .
Erdoğan ’ s ruling AKP traces its roots to political Islam , and many of its leaders ’ social networks are in Islamic countries – in stark contrast to the secular style of Turkey ’ s previous leaders , who proudly displayed their Western identity . as a result , formal and informal links between the new Turkish political élite and the Arab world have been easier to forge .
there can be no doubt that growing foreign-policy activism , especially in relation to the Middle East , has begun to enhance Turkey ’ s role and influence in its own region . indeed , Turkey is now firmly set to become a regional power , with its recent election to the UN Security Council a further testimony to its diplomatic prowess .
but does Turkey ’ s shift of focus southward and toward regional power status come at the expense of the country ’ s EU ambitions ?
in other words , this strategy is compatible with EU accession only if the EU strengthens its own capacity for concerted action on foreign policy . in that case , Turkey ’ s membership would not , as European federalists argue , lead to a weaker Europe .
Turkey ’ s Nation of Faiths
Ankara – After decades of official neglect and mistrust , Turkey has taken several steps to ensure the rights of the country ’ s non-Muslim religious minorities , and thus to guarantee that the rule of law is applied equally for all Turkish citizens , regardless of individuals ’ religion , ethnicity , or language .
as Deputy Prime Minister , I met with representatives of religious minorities in March 2010 , and visited the Armenian and Greek Orthodox Patriarchies in 2010 and 2011 . likewise , Turkey ’ s minister for European Union affairs , Egemen Bağış , has met with these communities ’ leaders on several occasions .
beyond establishing warm relations between the Turkish government and the country ’ s religious minorities , official policy has been changing as well . in May 2010 , Prime Minister Erdoğan issued an official statement that warned public servants and citizens against any discrimination against religious minorities , and that emphasized the absolute equality of Turkey ’ s non-Muslim citizens .
for the first time in the Republic ’ s history , 365 landholdings and buildings belonging to the minority communities were legally registered under their name . in 2008 , the government , despite fierce opposition from other political parties , changed the Law of Associations and allowed religious-minority associations to purchase real estate ( and to receive contributions , regardless of size , from abroad ) .
then , in August 2011 , an important amendment to the Associations law mandated the return of more than 350 properties to religious minorities . as part of these changes , the Greek-Orthodox Girls School in Beyoğlu , Istanbul , and the Jewish Community Center in Izmir have been granted legal status , ending a century-old dispute .
in order to facilitate their religious duties , the Orthodox metropolitans were granted Turkish citizenship . furthermore , the Associations Council , the country ’ s highest authority on religious associations , now includes for the first time a non-Muslim member representing minority faiths .
moreover , the Directorate-General of Associations has been charged with the task of renovating houses of worship used by religious minorities , including the historic Aya Nikola Church in Gökçeada Çanakkale , and the Assyrian Catholic Church and Greek Catholic Church in Iskenderun . a number of other churches and synagogues are also under renovation .
the Ministry of Culture and Tourism has renovated the Panagia Sümela Monastery , a 1,600-year-old church in Trabzon on the Black Sea coast . the first mass in decades was held in August 2010 , led by Bartholomew and attended by hundreds of worshippers from Greece , Russia , Georgia , Europe , the United States , and Turkey .
another milestone was the renovation and opening of the 1,100-year old Armenian Aghtamar Church in March 2007 . the first mass in 95 years was held in the church , led by the Armenian Archbishop Aram Ateşyan and attended by thousands of worshippers .
we are determined to solve their remaining problems , and we believe that we can do so through mutual trust and cooperation . Turkey ’ s Jews and Christians are full citizens with equal rights , and we will work to ensure that this reality is recognized in all areas of the country ’ s life .
Turkey ’ s New Course
on the one hand , despite the economic crisis engulfing neighboring Europe , Turkey remains the world ’ s second-fastest growing economy , after China . on the other hand , there is almost no issue on the global agenda – from Iraq and Afghanistan to Somalia , Iran , and the Arab Spring , and from sustainable development to a dialogue among civilizations – on which Turkey is not playing a visible role .
until a decade ago , Turkey was regarded as no more than a staunch NATO ally . that began to change in 2002 , when an era of political stability dawned , giving rise to a vision for a stronger Turkey – and a firm commitment to realizing that vision .
to this end , Turkey ’ s governments since 2002 implemented bold economic reforms that paved the way for sustainable growth and provided a firewall against the financial crisis that hit in 2008 . as a result , in less than a decade , GDP has tripled , making Turkey the world ’ s 16th largest economy .
we streamlined civil-military relations , guaranteed social and cultural rights , and attended to the problems of ethnic and religious minorities . these reforms transformed Turkey into a vibrant democracy and a more stable society , at peace with itself and able to view its external environment in a different light .
quite simply , we stopped viewing our geography and history as a curse or disadvantage . on the contrary , we began to regard our location at the crossroads of Europe , Asia , and the Middle East as an opportunity to interact simultaneously with multiple players .
we tried to expand political dialogue , enhance economic interdependence , and strengthen cultural and social understanding . and , while ten years is too short for a definitive assessment of such an ambitious policy , we have undoubtedly covered considerable ground .
on several occasions , we have also been instrumental in facilitating peace and reconciliation . but , what is more important , Turkey has become a model of success that many countries around us now seek to emulate .
in fact , Turkey ’ s external orientation has remained constant , because it rests on the values that we share with the free world . what has changed is our increased assertiveness in our efforts to ensure greater stability and human welfare in our region , evident in our advocacy of freedom , democracy , and accountability not only for ourselves , but also for others .
this approach has been reflected in the Arab Spring , which Turkey ardently supported from the outset . we have not hesitated in siding with those fighting for their rights and dignity .
Turkey is doing all that it can to alleviate the Syrian people ’ s suffering . unfortunately , the international community as a whole has so far performed poorly in providing an effective response to the crisis .
Turkey ’ s position on Iran ’ s nuclear program has been similarly clear : we are categorically opposed to the presence of weapons of mass destruction in our region . attempts to develop or acquire WMDs might well trigger a regional arms race , leading to further instability and threatening international peace and security .
but Iran ’ s program must be transparent , and its leaders must assure the international community of its non-military nature . the key is to close the confidence gap and pave the way for meaningful dialogue .
let us be clear : there is no military solution to this problem . military intervention would merely further complicate the issue , while creating new layers of conflict in our region and beyond .
in this and other matters , Turkey strives to act as a “ virtuous power , ” which requires us to align our national interests with values such as justice , democracy , and human dignity , and to achieve our foreign-policy goals through mutual cooperation rather than coercion .
Turkey served as a member of the United Nations Security Council in 2009-2010 , and is now seeking another term in 2015-2016 . given the crucial importance of developments in our part of the world , Turkey ’ s contribution to the Council ’ s work promises to be highly valuable .
in 2015 , moreover , we will assume the presidency of the G-20 , and we are committed to using our means and capabilities to make it a more effective organ of global governance .
while we have accomplished much already , more is required of us . given the challenges of our neighborhood , and the region ’ s central role in global affairs , Turkey will not refrain from taking on new responsibilities .
Erdoğan ’ s Kurdish Gambit
Istanbul – Conflict in the Middle East threatens not only the security of many of its states , but also their continued existence . Syria , Iraq , Lebanon , and others , now gripped by sectarian fighting , risk fragmenting into ethnic sub-states , transforming a region whose political geography was drawn nearly a century ago .
surveying the regional scene , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has conceived of an audacious plan to enhance Turkey ’ s regional standing and extend his own political dominance at home . facing the end of a self-imposed three-term limit as prime minister , he is intent on changing the Turkish constitution to introduce a presidential system – with himself on top as the first incumbent to wield much-enlarged power .
Erdoğan ’ s plan , however , depends on ending Turkey ’ s 30-year conflict with its own Kurdish population . as a result , the Erdoğan government has decided on negotiations with Abdullah Ocalan , the jailed leader of the Kurdish Workers ’ Party ( PKK ) , the armed Kurdish resistance movement .
the hope is to agree on a new , more liberal constitution that will strengthen the rights of Turkey ’ s largest ethnic minority and include substantial devolution of power to regional governments . in return , the PKK is expected to end its three-decade-long fight against the Turkish state .
Erdoğan envisions putting the constitutional changes and the terms of peace to a national referendum , a linkage that would transform Turkish politics . if the negotiations succeed , he will be remembered for his historic role in bringing peace , and will likely stand a better chance of realizing his presidential ambition , having gained parliamentary support for revising the constitution from the Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party .
if negotiations fail , however , Erdoğan will be held responsible for any deterioration in the security environment that results . a recently leaked account of Ocalan ’ s strategy highlights the risk , for it cites the PKK leader as threatening the government with full-scale war .
at the same time , the Turkish government is pursuing a separate path of negotiations , through a rapprochement with another Kurdish authority – the Kurdish Regional Government ( KRG ) in northern Iraq . the grand vision is to integrate Iraqi Kurdistan into the Turkish economy .
Turkey already supplies most of the KRG economy ’ s imports , which accounted for 70 % of Turkey ’ s almost $ 11 billion in exports to Iraq last year . but it is the incipient energy deal between Turkey and the KRG that is set to build the foundation for a real strategic alliance .
the undisclosed deal is believed to grant Turkey substantial concessions to explore new oil and gas fields in northern Iraq , as well as preferential rates for energy exports to Turkey . in return , Turkey is to help the KRG build pipeline infrastructure that will allow oil and gas to be exported to Turkey without relying on Iraq ’ s national pipeline , which is controlled by the central government in Baghdad .
within the Turkish government , this opening is viewed as an immense opportunity to reduce Turkey ’ s heavy dependence on energy imports . in addition to securing energy supplies , the deal would help Turkey to overcome its chronic current-account deficit : roughly 70 % of the country ’ s $ 84 billion trade deficit is due to the import bill for energy supplies .
for the KRG , the deal would secure the region ’ s future economic wealth without holding it hostage to an increasingly unsympathetic Iraqi government . under Iraq ’ s constitution , the Kurdish region is entitled to 17 % of the country ’ s oil and gas revenues .
but the United States remains adamantly opposed to such a deal between Turkey and the KRG , claiming that it would undermine Iraq ’ s stability and fuel secessionist tendencies in the north . in late February , during his overseas trip , which included a stop in Ankara , US Secretary of State John Kerry reiterated these concerns in his talks with his Turkish counterparts .
America ’ s fears are not shared in Turkish government circles , where the deals between the US oil giants Exxon and Chevron and the KRG are seen as proof that America is more concerned about its share of the pie in northern Iraq than it is about alleged threats to that country ’ s stability . not surprisingly , Erdoğan ’ s government has decided to pay little heed to US government concerns .
Erdoğan has now developed a plan that would take advantage of this development , ensure his political control , and lock in energy security for his country . he envisions a new regional order under Turkish leadership , based on a realignment between Turks and Kurds that underpins a strategic partnership for exploiting the region ’ s last untapped energy resources .
Turkey ’ s Transformation
Abdullah Gül ’ s election as Turkey ’ s 11th president marks a watershed in the country ’ s history .
in July , the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) – religiously conservative but economically liberal – won a landslide in parliamentary elections called after the military balked at seeing Gül become president . that victory , combined with Gül ’ s election , confirm the AKP ’ s emergence as a party of realignment , and that , despite an upsurge of xenophobic nationalism , Turks wanted to integrate with the European Union .
last April , Gül ’ s candidacy brought a threat of a coup from the military , precipitating the recent elections . thus , the electorate also made it clear that it no longer wanted the military involved in domestic politics , rejecting the generals ’ warnings that the AKP would lead the country into the darkness of theocratic rule .
the headscarf that Gül ’ s wife wears for religious reasons was seen as an assault on Turkey ’ s sacrosanct principle of secularism . indeed , outgoing President Ahmet Necdet Sezer refused to invite the wives of AKP deputies who covered their hair to state dinners and Republic Day receptions .
he has wide-ranging powers , including the authority to make senior government appointments . he appoints judges to high courts and members to the Higher Educational Council ( YOK ) .
this is why the crisis over the presidential election was actually a crisis of the constitutional order installed by the military when it ruled from 1980-1983 . that constitution – unlike Ataturk ’ s – was written by and for the military on the assumption that the Cold War would never end , and that the president would always be either a military person or someone close to the military .
an IMF-supported program in 2001 unleashed rapid economic growth , based on Turkey ’ s gradual but definitive transformation into a market economy . at the same time , Turkey moved decisively onto the path of political and administrative reform in order to start EU accession negotiations .
moreover , Turkey ’ s economic and social transformation brought forth a new elite . the AKP came to represent this new elite and its quest for political power .
however , the contest is more accurately seen as one between an open and an introverted Turkey ; between civilian , democratic rule and military tutelage ; and between a globalizing and a protectionist economy . the AKP ’ s support came from both the winners and losers of globalization , from conservative middle Anatolia and cosmopolitan Istanbul , from the nationalist Black Sea region and the predominantly Kurdish Southeast .
following the AKP ’ s parliamentary election victory in July , and now with the election of Gül , many observers predicted military intervention . although there is no doubt that the military , as the bastion of the secular establishment , does not like these results , a coup is virtually out of the question .
back in 1997 , when the military pushed the then Islamist-led government of Necmettin Erbakan out of power , the Islamist movement fractured . the younger , more modern , and outward-looking elements broke away from the traditional , anti-western , anti-Semitic older generation .
following the AKP ’ s victory in July , Erdoğan initially sought to avoid antagonizing the military by not renewing Gül ’ s presidential candidacy . yet Gül insisted , and the AKP united behind him .
as Turkey faces many regional challenges , his experience as foreign minister ought to serve him well . but an engaged and active president may cause tension with the prime minister who , in the Turkish system , is the real chief executive .
representatives of an economically dynamic and socially conservative heartland are moving Turkey toward reform . the republican project of modernization will continue , with a wider mobilization of society .
thus , Turkey will continue its unprecedented amalgam of Islam , capitalism , and secular liberal democracy . as unlikely as it may seem in the wake of the crisis over Gül ’ s candidacy , so far Turkey is managing this challenge well .
Turkey : the New Indispensable Nation
Ankara – Turkey put its imprint as one of the most influential countries not only on 2010 , but on the first decade of the third millennium . at the start of the new decade , too , Turkey ’ s geopolitical position , rich historical heritage , cultural depth , well-educated young population , ever-strengthening democracy , growing economy , and constructive foreign policy make it an indispensable country in a world transformed by rapid globalization .
by making use of all of its assets , Turkey is contributing to regional stability and peace and working towards a global order based on justice , equality , and transparency . as an emerging power , Turkey will continue to realize its own potential and simultaneously contribute to global peace .
while globalization offers new opportunities , it also causes new global problems and deepens the inequalities embedded in the world order . it is no longer possible to sustain the current world order , which , based as it is on a skewed notion of center-periphery relations , merely produces injustice and inequality .
Turkey seeks to contribute to regional and global peace by facilitating democratic reforms domestically and implementing a principled foreign policy . as a NATO member , Turkey aims to become a full member of the European Union and establish cordial relations with all of its southern and eastern neighbors .
Turkey constitutes a new synthesis because of its ability to link such diverse qualities and backgrounds . Turkey is thus capable of overcoming the dichotomies of East-West , Europe-Middle East , and North-South .
indeed , this capacity is essential because we need to leave behind the Manichean disagreements , conflicts , and fears of the Cold War era . those who see the world through those old , fearful lenses have difficulty understanding Turkey ’ s rising profile and dynamism .
acting on these principles , Turkey is following a proactive foreign policy stretching from the Balkans to the Middle East and the Caucasus . this geography is Turkey ’ s natural historical and cultural hinterland .
history clearly shows that it is impossible to establish and sustain global peace without ensuring peace and stability in the Balkans and the Middle East . Turkey is following a constructive and inclusive policy for these regions , which are marked by remarkable models of cohabitation , science , arts , culture , and civilization .
due to our recent efforts , the wounds of the Bosnian war are being healed , facilitating peace and stability among Balkan peoples . Turkey ’ s efforts are also helping to prevent wars in the Middle East , and our intense efforts have helped keep a diplomatic track open on the Iranian nuclear issue .
moreover , we are helping to facilitate political stability in Iraq and helping the NATO mission in Afghanistan . and , of paramount importance , Turkey is making enormous efforts to help establish an independent and sustainable Palestinian state – efforts that are appreciated by Turkey ’ s Western and Eastern friends alike .
today , Turkey is following a policy that represents a sense of justice in the Middle East , and is working toward the removal of artificial borders and walls among the region ’ s peoples . we desire to live in a region where the dignity of every person is respected .
we know that it is not possible to attain global peace unless we establish sustainable peace in the Middle East , which requires resolving the Palestinian question . therefore , we urge Israel and all other countries involved to follow constructive and peaceful policies .
motivated by these principles , Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and I showed through our “ Alliance of Civilizations Initiative ” in 2004 that cultural , historic , and religious differences are no reason for conflict . the basis for our approach to humanity is the following principle of the famous Turkish poet Yunus Emre : “ We love and respect the created because of the Creator . ”
as a result , we stand firmly opposed to discrimination against any society , religion , sect , culture , or country . I consider anti-Semitism , Islamophobia , and prejudice against Christianity crimes against humanity , whose common values and ethical rules oblige us to confront and reject all forms of discrimination .
today , Turkey ’ s annual GDP has reached $ 800 billion , making it Europe ’ s sixth largest economy and the 17th largest in the world . it has also been one of the least impacted by the global economic crisis , with growing foreign trade , a strong banking system , and diverse and prospering small and medium-size enterprises .
all of these qualities have transformed Turkey into an attractive place for business , media , artists , diplomats , students , and non-governmental organizations from around the world . Turkey ’ s ever-increasing soft power is becoming one of its most significant traits , which we will continue to use to enhance regional and global peace .
the impact of globalization has brought about a rebalancing of power , but the demand for justice , transparency , and legitimacy remains constant . the global problems of our times necessitate cooperation , political will , and sacrifice .
Turkey will continue to work toward a just and equitable global order in 2011 and beyond . this is a responsibility emanating from our history , geography , and the universal values that we hold .
Turkey to the EU ’ s Rescue
Lausanne – The Copenhagen Climate Change Conference was an unmitigated disaster for the European Union . instead of the EU claiming center stage , as its leaders assumed it would , the key actors were the United States , Brazil , South Africa , India , and China .
as its “ hard power ” ebbs , its “ soft power , ” as illustrated by the Copenhagen summit , seems to be very weak . this in part arises from a failure to provide the EU with political power .
the Lisbon Treaty was a compromise constitutional arrangement that would nevertheless give the EU greater weight and authority precisely for occasions such as the Copenhagen summit , when global issues are addressed . though multiple European actors on the world stage were more than justified in the old days , this is no longer the case .
but in Copenhagen , the structure established by the Lisbon Treaty failed .
with only 7 % of the world ’ s population ( and rapidly dwindling ) and composed mainly of post-industrial low-growth economies , the EU is increasingly seen as marginal . Europeans do not realize how little interest in “ European affairs ” there is in Seoul , Sydney , São Paolo , or San Francisco .
but there seems little prospect for a European revival . the EU will continue to decline and become increasingly marginalized as it fails to find the spirit or the structure to adjust to the profound transformations and challenges of the twenty-first century .
there is one thing , however , that could revive the EU , give it much enhanced global respectability , and make it an “ interesting ” place , as well as ensure a return to the international limelight : Turkey ’ s admission as a full member .
it is impossible to airbrush Turkey out of European history . apart from being an integral part of Europe , membership for Turkey , with its young and dynamic population , would provide a great fillip for Europe ’ s aging demographic profile .
there is more ethnic diversity in , say , Malaysia than in the entire EU . ASEAN as a whole , with a population of 580 million , is not significantly bigger than the EU ( with 500 million ) , yet it encompasses an infinitely greater degree of ethnic , linguistic , cultural , and religious diversity .
by admitting Turkey , with the world ’ s fifth-largest Muslim population ( after Indonesia , Pakistan , Bangladesh , and India ) , the EU would be in a position to establish close ties with the world ’ s 1.8 billion Muslims , and could become a credible voice on reform within the Islamic world . Turkish membership in the Union would also greatly ease the assimilation of the EU ’ s own Muslim minorities .
EU lethargy and growing irrelevance in global public affairs owes much to Eurocentric political atavism . one potential benefit of the Copenhagen debacle could be that it forces the Union to wake up to the new world of the twenty-first century .
an EU with Turkey as a member would be far better situated to meet today ’ s challenges than an EU without Turkey . but , unfortunately , Turkey , like much of the rest of the world , is rather turned off by the EU .
that seduction should begin this year , with an agenda that sets the process and timeframe for accession , to be followed by an EU-Turkey Treaty that confirms the country ’ s accession by 2020 .
exit Afghanistan ?
new DELHI – In his victory speech to a rapturous crowd in Chicago following his reelection , President Barack Obama affirmed that America ’ s “ decade-long conflict ” in Afghanistan will now end . the line was greeted with prolonged applause – and understandably so .
at the beginning , the war was aimed at eliminating Al Qaeda , vanquishing the Taliban , and transforming Afghanistan into something resembling a Western-style nation-state . with none of these goals fully achieved , America ’ s intervention – like every other intervention in Afghanistan ’ s history – is ending unsatisfactorily .
the first is the management of the transition to Afghan control , which depends on an orderly withdrawal of American and NATO forces by 2014 . the second is the election , also to be held in 2014 , of a new Afghan president – a process that needs to permit the United States and its NATO allies to claim plausibly that they are handing the country over to a legitimate government .
for Afghanistan , ravaged by war without respite since the “ Saur Revolution ” of 1978 , the endgame will be even more nerve-wracking . as the US military leaves , it will enter another period of political and strategic uncertainty , after almost a half-century of disorder and civil war .
today , almost three generations of Afghans have lived from birth to adulthood without having known stability and peace . and , as a visiting American scholar / diplomat recently told me in a confidential conversation : “ In the US , too , at least a generation of our children , from birth till the age of 15 , have seen their country almost continuously at war . ”
it is against this bitter backdrop that a new Afghan president will be elected and the withdrawal of forces carried out . will these two developments bring about a stable peace , or will Afghanistan succumb to instability once more ?
and , like Vietnam , will the US – exhausted and nearly bankrupted by the effort – see all of its supposed gains evaporate soon after it leaves ? after all , Al Qaeda , albeit weakened , remains capable of regenerating inside Afghanistan , where the Taliban remain dominant in the country ’ s east and south , as well as in neighboring North Waziristan in Pakistan .
just how weakened America is in the region matters . as the US strategist Daniel Twining has observed : “ Over the coming four years , US leadership … will be essential ” for “ the consolidation of a wide-ranging strategic partnership with India , ” as well as for efforts “ to prevent Pakistan ’ s many pathologies … from spilling over in ways that undermine fundamental US ( and Indian ) interests . ”
our primary aim is the restoration of peace and , if not stability , an acceptable political equilibrium . even if we did not incur the same costs as the US over the past decade – the hundreds of billions of dollars spent , and the many young people killed or injured – we have paid the price that regional uncertainty always imposes : lost trade , lost growth , refugees , and violence .
as a result , Afghanistan will remain what it was : a violent and ungovernable tribal melange . indeed , across the region , apprehension is growing that when foreign troops leave , Afghanistan will again descend into civil war , ultimately bringing the Taliban back to power .
that is why “ bringing the troops home early ” has become the prime objective of Western politicians who are engaged in the region . the West needs to get out before the bloodletting starts again in earnest .
my fear is that we have not seen the last of Al Qaeda or the Taliban . as a neighboring country , India would face disturbing consequences if they returned to power in Afghanistan , as would Iran , which would not sit idly by if sectarian strife intensified and the Shia became targets of a resurgent Taliban .
other neighbors would also pay a price should the Taliban ’ s seemingly invariable return turn bloody , however immune they believe they are . China , which has invested billions of dollars in developing Afghanistan ’ s natural resources – investments protected , ironically , by the US – would be certain to experience greater unrest in Xinjiang Province , home to millions of disaffected Muslims .
but the country that will be most affected is Pakistan , which faces challenges to its territorial and political integrity . the territorial challenge is , no doubt , a mushrooming anxiety ; an innocuous remark by an American envoy about the Durand Line , which marks the Afghanistan-Pakistan border , drew sharp retorts from both countries .
Afghanistan ’ s history of occupation by foreign troops and their eventual withdrawal has been repeated so many times that one wearies of repeating the tale . yet this history is the litmus test .
turning North Korea Around
Seoul – Negotiations over the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula look set to resume . sadly , they are unlikely to end soon .
while all leaders – including North Korea ’ s Kim Jong Il – remain committed to denuclearization in public , none appears ready to risk much in terms of domestic politics to achieve that end . so the best the world can currently hope for is revived dialogue , an agreement to freeze the North ’ s Yongbyon nuclear plant , and perhaps a moratorium on further missile and nuclear tests .
to speed the process , a new long-term strategy aimed at the underlying factors at work in North Korea – and in relations with its rulers – is needed . simply put , the US and other powers need to pursue constructive economic engagement with North Korea to help the regime achieve “ strength and prosperity ” through economic transition and integration with the global economy .
constructive economic engagement will benefit ordinary North Koreans , who have suffered as much as any people on Earth since the Cold War ’ s end . the root cause of North Korea ’ s economic difficulties is its isolation from the forces of globalization , from which East Asia in particular has profited .
the best hope for most North Koreans is the subterranean market economy that fills the gaps in the state ’ s planned economy and public distribution system . trade with China is keeping those market forces supplied with goods and business opportunities across the border .
nothing will . the Korean Peninsula will most likely achieve “ complete , verifiable , and irreversible denuclearization ” only when North Korea is already moving in the direction of economic growth and integration .
of course , some of the big-ticket items in an economic engagement policy will remain contingent on progress in security arrangements and peninsular denuclearization . but North Korea and the international community can already take some substantive steps .
during the recent visit of a high-level North Korean delegation to the US , there were encouraging signals that its rulers would welcome increased economic contacts , including with international financial institutions . moreover , North Korea is actively courting foreign investment .
and the regime will not want the process of economic opening to get too far ahead of security agreements and political normalization . after all , the main lesson that North Korean leaders take from China ’ s success is that security ( Mao Zedong ’ s rapprochement with the US ) precedes economic transition ( Deng Xiaoping ’ s reform and opening policy ) .
in the US , North Korea is seen mostly through the prism of nuclear non-proliferation , and the new administration is wary of being tricked into giving its rulers anything without getting fissile material in return . in South Korea , President Lee Myung-bak ’ s political base wants to roll back , not reinvigorate , the Sunshine Policy , and there is a widespread ( though by no means universal ) weariness with engagement .
in Japan , fear of North Korea ’ s nuclear threat and anger over the abduction of Japanese citizens generates powerful political pressure against engagement . China is the one place that quietly implements a constructive economic engagement approach .
turning Point at Chernobyl
the nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl 20 years ago this month , even more than my launch of perestroika , was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union five years later . indeed , the Chernobyl catastrophe was an historic turning point : there was the era before the disaster , and there is the very different era that has followed .
the very morning of the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear station on April 26 , 1986 , the Politburo met to discuss the situation , and then organized a government commission to deal with the consequences . the commission was to control the situation , and to ensure that serious measures were taken , particularly in regard to people ’ s health in the disaster zone .
the Politburo did not immediately have appropriate and complete information that would have reflected the situation after the explosion . nevertheless , it was the general consensus of the Politburo that we should openly deliver the information upon receiving it .
in fact , nobody knew the truth , and that is why all our attempts to receive full information about the extent of the catastrophe were in vain . we initially believed that the main impact of the explosion would be in Ukraine , but Belarus , to the northwest , was hit even worse , and then Poland and Sweden suffered the consequences .
but in truth we had nothing to hide , as we simply had no information for a day and a half . only a few days later , we learned that what happened was not a simple accident , but a genuine nuclear catastrophe – an explosion of a Chernobyl ’ s fourth reactor .
for example , when the reactor blew up , the fire was immediately put out with water , which only worsened the situation as nuclear particles began spreading through the atmosphere . meanwhile we were still able to take measures in helping people within the disaster zone ; they were evacuated , and more than 200 medical organizations were involved in testing the population for radiation poisoning .
there was a serious danger that the contents of the nuclear reactor would seep into the soil , and then leak into the Dnepr river , thus endangering the population of Kiev and other cities along the riverbanks . therefore , we started the job of protecting the river banks , initiating a total deactivation of the Chernobyl plant .
the Chernobyl disaster , more than anything else , opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression , to the point that the system as we knew it could no longer continue . it made absolutely clear how important it was to continue the policy of glasnost , and I must say that I started to think about time in terms of pre-Chernobyl and post-Chernobyl .
even today , the legacy of Chernobyl affects the economies of Russia , Ukraine , and Belarus . some even suggest that the economic price for the USSR was so high that it stopped the arms race , as I could not keep building arms while paying to clean up Chernobyl .
but Chernobyl opened my eyes like nothing else : it showed the horrible consequences of nuclear power , even when it is used for non-military purposes . one could now imagine much more clearly what might happen if a nuclear bomb exploded .
countries that have them – the members of the so-called “ nuclear club ” – are in no hurry to get rid of them . on the contrary , they continue to refine their arsenals , while countries without nuclear weapons want them , believing that the nuclear club ’ s monopoly is a threat to the world peace .
the twentieth anniversary of the Chernobyl catastrophe reminds us that we should not forget the horrible lesson taught to the world in 1986 . we should do everything in our power to make all nuclear facilities safe and secure .
the fact that world leaders now increasingly talk about this imperative suggests that the lesson of Chernobyl is finally being understood .
turning the Page in Mexico
three months from now , when Mexico ’ s new president Felipe Calderón takes office , many will consider it a dubious honor . these are perhaps the only two certainties in Mexico ’ s politics right now .
indeed , after ten years of uninterrupted macroeconomic stability – something Mexico had not experienced since the 1960 ’ s – the middle class has expanded dramatically , and reasonably priced bank credit is now available to millions who had been excluded in the past . yet , despite these robust changes , poverty remains widespread , inequality abysmal , and social resentment is on the rise .
in the long run , the answer undoubtedly lies in the transformation of the Mexican left , and partly also of the Mexican right . for years , both were de facto subsumed within the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , which ruled Mexico for seven decades .
the right-of-center Party of National Action ( PAN ) , the grouping of current President Vicente Fox and Calderón , needs to acquire a sincere and profound social conscience . it must transform itself into something like the Social Christian or Christian Democratic parties that exist in Costa Rica , Chile , Venezuela , and Peru .
not only is it not New Labor ; it is not even like the French , Spanish , or Chilean Socialist Parties , or Brazil ’ s Workers ’ Party . it continues to be a movement with a revolutionary faction – not a majority , but certainly a large minority – bent on insurrection , socialism , and “ anti-imperialist ” alignment with Cuba and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez .
obviously , many of its members and leaders do subscribe to these tenets , and disapprove in private of López Obrador ’ s rabble-rousing antics . but , as long they remain relatively powerless , Mexico will remain unbalanced , deprived of the modern left that it needs to combat poverty and inequality , and hostage to those who still believe in revolution and the assault on the Winter Palace .
the most urgent , feasible , and relevant steps involve electoral and legal reforms aimed at avoiding a repeat of the current protests over the presidential vote . these include establishing a second-round run-off in presidential elections , so that Mexico ’ s next president has a mandate supported by more than 50 % of the voters .
perhaps most importantly , Mexico must devise a French-style semi-presidential system whereby a designated Prime Minister is responsible for building majorities in Congress , and must be ratified by the latter . eliminating the purchase of air time on radio and television during campaigns , with the consequent reduction in their cost , would complement these changes .
Fox and his team thought that the mechanisms that worked during the authoritarian period could simply be transferred to the democratic era and function smoothly . in fact , none of the major economic and social reforms Mexico desperately needs in order to grow more rapidly , distribute wealth more evenly , and combat poverty more effectively can be passed if the institutional scaffolding is not rebuilt .
that is what Calderón can and must do in order to render moot today ’ s debates about the fairness of the election that brought him to power . it is time for Mexico to turn the page , but it must turn the right page .
tweets of Freedom
new YORK – Google has been widely celebrated for its loud refusal to continue censoring its search results in China . it is still unclear whether Google will continue to operate in China , but in any event we are not about to see much change in China ’ s Internet policy .
even if Google does ultimately leave China , the game is not over . Western companies can promote Internet freedom from the outside , by providing useful technology as well as the keys to access it .
Twitter is largely blocked by China ’ s “ great firewall ” ( GFW ) , which prevents Chinese people from accessing certain sites . yet Twitter has an almost religious following among tech-savvy Chinese , whose determination to use the service outstrips authorities ’ efforts to block access to it .
these “ netizens ” surmount the firewall by way of proxy servers or virtual private networks ( VPNs ) that allow them to browse the Web as if they were outside of China . earlier this month , Chinese twitterati helped get the GFW onto the list of Twitter ’ s top ten “ trending topics ” ( or most tweeted terms ) – an impressive feat given that Twitter is supposed to be inaccessible in China .
Twitter , which lets people send bite-size messages to large groups , allows Chinese to quickly disseminate urgent news or even uncomfortable facts . “ Twitter can create a faster information flow than any official agency , ” says Michael Anti , a journalist in Beijing who has long been at the forefront of the Chinese Internet movement .
he says that he was arrested after spreading word about a crime that allegedly involved local officials . he tweeted an SOS via his mobile phone after he was arrested last July , and his case quickly attracted both domestic and international attention , which helped secure his release a little over two weeks later .
so just imagine if Twitter were available to the larger Chinese population . the problem is that many Chinese still lack the simple tools that would enable them to get past the GFW .
when I asked Guo how the outside world could make Twitter more accessible in China , he replied that we could help by “ providing affordable VPN service . ” Foreign companies , he added , could make available more secure browsers that would help “ Chinese people to circumvent the GFW . ”
but , given the political sensitivities of foreign pressure on China , it is unclear how far Western governments will be able to go . that is where companies like Twitter come in .
even if Twitter ’ s co-founders did not necessarily develop it to be a tool of democratization , that is precisely what it has become . in April 2009 , young people in Moldova used Twitter to organize protests against their government .
in November , citizen protests against the construction of an incinerator in Guangzhou became a widely Tweeted event . referring to the role that Twitter played in protests in Iran and Moldova , Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey told me , “ These are all events and movements that people chose to make happen , and Twitter was a tool that happened to be there to make it more easy . ”
Twitter may now be taking more aggressive steps to promote Internet freedom abroad . co-founder and CEO Evan Williams recently suggested that software developers were working on technology to evade government barriers , though he did not give specific details .
the problem is that the standoff has now taken on the tone of a state-to-state confrontation . China , apparently still reeling from a “ century of humiliation ” at the hands of outsiders , will not be pushed around by America .
ultimately the Chinese Internet cat-and-mouse game will be won with innovation , not political pressure . the world should continue to flood the Chinese market , and those of other countries that restrict freedom of expression , with cutting-edge technology .
twenty-five Years of HIV / AIDS
it is now a quarter-century since the acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) was recognized . the knowledge that has been gained since then has been breathtaking , and the pace at which basic research has been translated into lifesaving treatments is unprecedented .
the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) as the cause of AIDS was followed by elucidation of its pathogenesis , natural history , and epidemiology , the creation of a diagnostic blood test , and the development of antiretroviral drugs . in 1996 , the approval of the first drug of a class called protease inhibitors led to the adoption of a multi-drug , anti-HIV regimen known as highly active antiretroviral therapy , or HAART .
as a result , since these combinations of drugs were introduced , at least three million years of life have been saved in the United States alone . we now have more than two dozen approved anti-HIV drugs and drug combinations , and a robust pipeline of next-generation drugs in various stages of development and clinical testing .
but nowadays our task is to apply these scientific and technological advances to delivering treatment and prevention strategies to people throughout the world , particularly those in resource-poor nations . despite the successes in treating HIV / AIDS in the United States and other developed countries , it is clear that efforts to combat the pandemic must be scaled up in Africa , Asia , and other parts of the world where HIV / AIDS exacts its greatest toll .
programs such as the President ’ s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria , and philanthropies like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Foundation have helped make drugs available to treat 2 million people infected with HIV in lower- and middle-income countries . but fewer than 25 % of the people in these countries who need antiretroviral drugs are receiving them .
with 4.3 million new HIV infections each year throughout the world , we face an untenable situation , as new HIV infections far outstrip our ability to treat all those infected . so improvements in our ability to prevent HIV infections from occurring are desperately needed .
recent studies suggest that adult male circumcision can be a promising prevention strategy , if properly and hygienically performed and accompanied by appropriate counseling and post-surgical care . likewise , the ongoing development of topical microbicides offers the hope of empowering women to protect themselves from HIV infection when using condoms or refusing sexual intercourse is not feasible .
but the greatest scientific and public health goal in HIV / AIDS research still eludes us : the development of an effective HIV vaccine . this challenge has been particularly difficult because of the nature of the virus , particularly its ability to integrate itself into the genome of host cells , to readily mutate , and to conceal that part of its outer coat that would induce protective antibodies .
we also know that the body ’ s natural immune response against HIV is inadequate in containing or controlling the virus . indeed , since the discovery of HIV , there has never been a documented case in which an individual ’ s immune system has ever completely eradicated the virus following established infection .
many current studies focus on developing vaccines that might not completely prevent HIV infection , but that still could slow the progression of HIV or make a person less likely to pass the virus on to others . but our ultimate goal is to develop a vaccine that can prevent HIV infection .
despite the extraordinary scientific and medical accomplishments in the battle against HIV / AIDS so far , history will judge us by what we accomplish in the next quarter-century , and how we respond to the challenge of delivering the fruits of our research efforts to those who need them most .
Twilight of a Pontiff
once again Pope John Paul II has returned to hospital , gravely ill . even for non-Catholics like myself , this is an occasion to ponder what the world will lose when the Pope ’ s body finally succumbs to his ailments .
while in other countries , most emphatically in Romania , but also in what was then Czechoslovakia and in Hungary , the alternative to communism was a vacuum or at best a few isolated organizations in civil society , Poland had an alternative source of legitimacy . before and after his election , the then Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Krakow was its most effective representative .
Cardinal Wojtyla ’ s election as Pope therefore had a significance far beyond the confines of the Church . actually he himself did not like the identification of his church with civil society .
in matters of doctrine and ethics , John Paul II represented the conservative view . he was the counterpoint to Pope John XXIII , who , through the Second Vatican Council of the 1960 ’ s and in numerous other ways , tried to reconcile Catholics with the modern age .
Pope John Paul arrested this process and even tried to reverse it . for progressive theologians like Hans Küng , he was and is therefore a force of anti-modernism , even counter-enlightenment .
at the same time , the Pope became the first great traveling Pontiff of modern times , almost a symbol of a globalized world . this meant that his image if not his words reached out to millions who do not belong to his church .
by that fact alone , he added a spiritual dimension to an age which is dominated by worldly concerns , such as wealth and show business . those of us who believe in a multidimensional culture will be grateful to him for his enormous efforts , thus for his “ catholicism ” in the original sense of the word , his all-embracing concerns .
on the other side of the balance sheet , and despite his global outreach , Pope John Paul II cannot be described as particularly ecumenical . the beginnings of Christian ecumenicism under his predecessors did not advance much in his 25 years .
the Catholic-Jewish dialogue in particular was in good hands with him . when a distinguished Jewish scholar thanked him for what he had done to cultivate Catholic-Jewish relations , he replied : “ That was not me , that was Providence , ” and then added with his inimitable smile : “ And me . ”
but his reign spans a time in which numerous regional conflicts turned violent . there was little he could do in Kosovo or the Congo .
the years of John Paul II ’ s papacy have not actually been a time in which “ soft power ” could achieve a great deal anywhere , so that Stalin ’ s famous question , “ How many divisions has the Pope ? , ” remained topical . this was all the more relevant to the extent that Pope John Paul II is not enamored with the United States .
the Pope ’ s legacy is , in other words , a story of great strengths and considerable weaknesses . it would be incomplete , however , were one not to mention the warm , curious , friendly , and humorous human being underneath it all .
Twilight of Our Political Gods
for some time I thought that the Twenty-Second Amendment to the United States Constitution was probably the best way to ensure that political leaders do not overstay their welcome , and , just as importantly , wear out their effectiveness . this Amendment bars US Presidents from holding office for more than two four-year terms .
perhaps I had forgotten the travails of President George W. Bush ’ s predecessors in their second term , but his own current predicament shows that the constitutional limit has its own problems . for one thing , it makes the President a lame duck sometime in his second term .
however , the fate of Bush ’ s friend , British Prime Minister Tony Blair , shows that lame-duck status can occur even without a constitutional term limit – indeed , without a written constitution at all . Blair made the fatal mistake of setting his own limit to his tenure of office by saying that he would not contest a fourth election as leader of the Labour Party .
indeed , reforms announced by Blair increasingly sound like empty promises , because the apparently inevitable has happened : the Prime Minister has lost touch with the public . what used to be his charisma is now the permanent re-enactment of the all-too-familiar .
can it be the same President Oscar Arias who ( barely ) won the recent presidential election in Costa Rica and now returns to power after 20 years ? and was not Silvio Berlusconi ’ s candidate for the presidency of the Italian Senate , Giulio Andreotti , a junior member of one of Italy ’ s first post-1945 governments ?
who can forget Margaret Thatcher ’ s tears when her “ friends ” told her that her time was up ? when Prime Minister Harold Wilson suddenly resigned in 1976 and left No. 10 Downing Street to the late James Callaghan , people became suspicious : had he been forced out by some secret service plot concerning South Africa ?
abandoning the habit involves not only the inconvenience of losing perks and a certain lifestyle , but also the loss of power . power may be increasingly illusory in a globalized world , but it is an illusion that is shared by others , and the longer one inhabits it , the more one ’ s circle consists of others who share the belief .
when Tony Blair says that the most important liberty is security from terrorist attacks , he has forgotten the first principles of his party and his country . Overstaying one ’ s welcome may be the professional disease of political leaders , but it is above all incompatible with democracy as a framework for bringing about change without violence .
while the US Constitution shows the limits of institutional safeguards , the role of political parties is clearly significant when it comes to limiting terms in power . like Thatcher , Blair now hears from his party that he should go and replies that “ the people ” still want him .
in the end , there is no foolproof method to guarantee that political leaders leave without tears . what matters is that mechanisms are in place that do make them leave , probably rather too late , and certainly with some pain and unhappiness , but in time for the constitution of liberty to remain intact .
two and a Half Cheers for the Mediterranean Union
maybe it is time to be a bit more generous to French President Nicolas Sarkozy and look at the outcome of what he does rather than the way that he does it .
appearing to speak without giving the issue much thought , Sarkozy initially proposed a club of European and mostly Arab states along the Mediterranean ’ s shore . it would have been in essence a French-run enterprise that the rest of Europe would have paid for .
there was also a strong suspicion that the French were trying to find a way to buy off Turkey with a relationship falling well short of European Union membership .
so the auguries for an attempt to revitalize Europe ’ s relationship with its Mediterranean partners were not good . but by the time of the grand Paris Summit in July to send the new club on its way , the initial suspicions had largely been overcome .
the original Barcelona Process , launched in 1995 , was an excellent scheme . intended to provide an economic and political backdrop to peace-making through confidence-building in the Middle East , it was an admirable recognition of Europe ’ s historical , commercial , cultural , and political ties with its neighbors to the south of the sea which has brought us all together over the years .
there were people-to-people links . there was a forum where Israelis and their long-term Arab foes could sit together and discuss other matters than the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
development projects were funded through grants or cheap loans , and these have probably played at least some part in increasing the attractiveness of the Maghreb and the Mashraq to foreign investors . there was some lowering of agricultural and other tariffs by the EU .
but , as a significant component of Europe ’ s policy toward its most crucial neighbors , the successes of the Barcelona Process were modest : a great idea on the launch pad had difficulty getting off the ground .
so Sarkozy deserves at least two and a half cheers for trying to revitalize it . but if the Mediterranean Union is to achieve more than was managed in its first manifestation , a number of things will need to happen .
for example , there are still too many barriers to agricultural trade between the North and the South . and guess which country leads the opposition to any significant opening up of European agriculture .
second , however slow we have been in opening up a real Mediterranean market , the barriers to freer trade between Arab League countries are just as great .
third , it was excellent that in Paris Sarkozy began the process of bringing Syria in out of the diplomatic cold . we must also hope that his attempts to act as a peace-broker between West Bank Palestinians and Israel are blessed with success .
but the truth is that Europe , for all the gallant efforts of Javier Solana , has been absent from serious politics in the Middle East . we have not dared to cross America .
for a start , we should recognize that there will be no political settlement in Palestine without including Hamas . what would incredibly have been former British Prime Minister Tony Blair ’ s first visit to Gaza in his first year of peace-making had to be canceled recently because of security concerns .
finally , Europe has to decide how serious it is about all the admirable stuff in the Barcelona Process on pluralism , civil society , the rule of law , and democracy .
is Europe serious that a shared concept of human rights should be one of the foundations of our Mediterranean partnership ? if so , what are we in Europe proposing to do about it ?
two Cheers for the Rhineland Model
so when Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , early in his first term , signed the so-called Blair-Schröder paper , which pledged agreement with British Prime Minister Tony Blair on liberalizing reforms , he made certain that it was published in London and played down in Berlin . similarly , the European Union &apos;s Lisbon agenda of economic liberalization was never really taken seriously in Germany , France , or most other countries on the Continent .
how things have changed in the last five years ! today , few people - if any - refer to the Rhineland model with such satisfaction .
as things stand now , the German economy lags behind most others in Europe , and almost all European economies trail Britain and the United States . unemployment is high and growing , as German companies move production to low-wage countries in Eastern Europe or Asia .
if all this leads people to conclude that social justice is being sacrificed to profits , cuts in public expenditure harden that conclusion even more . social entitlements are being reduced , while individual contributions to cover the cost of health care , pensions , education , and basic welfare programs rise - not just in the Rhineland and neighboring länder , but in other countries that follow a similar model .
some may never have been viable . for example , the Rhineland model used many measures of social policy that had built-in growth trends that were bound to make them unaffordable .
unsurprisingly , high payroll taxes strained the capacity of working people and mounting non-wage labor costs eroded companies &apos; international competitiveness . for a while , borrowing hid the extent of the problem ; but today the extent of the burden that the accumulated debt that resulted from this borrowing is placing on future generations - a grave injustice in its own right - is clear .
thus , the Rhineland model &apos;s once-robust institutions of social justice were bound to be squeezed . but the capitalism that formed the Rhineland model &apos;s other component also changed , and here it is not wrong to blame globalization .
the old notion that large companies are responsible for their employees &apos; welfare from cradle to grave - providing not only wages and bonuses , but sports facilities , cheap holidays , and generous retirement benefits - fell into desuetude . overseas owners were less than understanding of the German custom of paying a thirteenth monthly salary at Christmas .
beyond business culture , there is the fact that manufacturing , until recently the major source of strength of the German and other European economies , has begun to emigrate in a big way . soon not only our refrigerators and television sets , but even our cars and machine tools , will come largely from China .
people have become weary of the word reform , because for most it means a reduction in entitlements and living standards . still , constructing a welfare state fit for new economic conditions is a task that must be undertaken .
this will be a welfare state based on a new balance of solidarity and individual effort . it may mean that after a decades-long economic miracle , people must accept a modest reduction in their standard of living .
no one has yet managed this process , not even the Anglo Saxons . a truly modern economy will be a service economy that combines high-productivity knowledge activities with indispensable personal service jobs .
it is possible - indeed , likely - that modern service-based economies will look very different in the Rhineland , Southeast England , Lombardy , and the Île-de-France . such diversity may include varying degrees of social justice , if people choose to pay more or less for that purpose .
so there is no reason for despair in the Rhineland - or for gloating by the enemies of its economic model . even in an increasingly globalized economy , diversity will continue to be the hallmark .
the New “ Two Chinas ” Question
today , a new , but very different , “ two Chinas ” question is emerging . it centers on whether China is best understood as a strong country , with a promising future despite some short-term difficulties , or as a country facing serious structural problems and uncertain long-term prospects .
hundreds of millions of Chinese had entered the middle class . China ’ s model of authoritarian efficiency seemed attractive to many other developing countries , particularly in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis , which began in the United States and thus seemed to discredit American-style liberal capitalism .
the slowdown should come as no surprise ; all developing economies experience something similar as they grow and mature . nonetheless , the speed and degree of change have caught the authorities off guard , and have stoked official fears that growth will fall short of the rate needed for the country to modernize as planned .
the government ’ s alarm at the sharper-than-expected economic slowdown was reflected in its heavy-handed intervention in July to freeze stock markets in the midst of a dramatic price correction . that move was followed this month by a surprise devaluation of the renminbi , which suggests that the shift away from export-led growth is not working as hoped .
meanwhile , President Xi Jinping ’ s anti-corruption campaign increasingly looks like a strategy to consolidate power , rather than an effort to reform China ’ s state for the benefit of its economy and society . corruption is pervasive , and Xi ’ s campaign remains broadly popular .
as a result of these developments , one hears much less of late about the Chinese model and more about the Chinese reality . aside from slowing growth , that reality includes severe environmental damage , one result of decades of rapid , coal-fueled industrialization .
China ’ s aging population , an unintended consequence of its draconian one-child policy , poses another threat to long-term prosperity . with the dependency ratio – the proportion of children and pensioners relative to working-age men and women – set to rise rapidly in the coming years , economic growth will remain subdued , while health-care and pension costs will increasingly strain government budgets .
what is increasingly apparent is that China ’ s leaders want the economic growth that capitalism produces , but without the downturns that come with it . they want the innovation that an open society generates , but without the intellectual freedom that defines it .
some observers , fearing a rising China , will breathe a sigh of relief at its current difficulties . but that may prove to be a shortsighted reaction .
most dangerous of all , a struggling China could be tempted to turn to foreign adventurism to placate a public frustrated by slower economic growth and an absence of political freedom . indeed , there are some signs that the authorities are doing just this in the South China Sea .
the US and others will need to push back to ensure that China does not act on such a temptation . but these countries would be equally wise to signal to China that it is welcome to take its place among the world ’ s leading countries if it acts responsibly and according to the rules set for all .
but the bigger policy choices will be China ’ s to make . the government will need to find the right balance between government interests and individual rights , between economic growth and environmental stewardship , and between the role of markets and that of the state .
major social unrest cannot be ruled out . the one certainty is that the next three decades will not mirror the last three .
two Decades from Warsaw
Warsaw – “ Poland – ten years , Hungary – ten months , East Germany – ten weeks , Czechoslovakia – ten days . ” So chirped many in Prague in November 1989 , reflecting the pride and the joy of the Velvet Revolution , but also the sustained effort that was needed to end communism , whose demise began in Warsaw the previous February .
indeed , communism ’ s breakdown began ten years earlier in Poland , during Pope John Paul II ’ s first pilgrimage to his homeland , a visit that shook communist rule to its foundation . within a year , Polish workers were striking for the right to establish independent trade unions , staging two weeks of sit-ins at state-owned factories to achieve their goal .
the movement united ten million people : workers and professors , peasants and students , priests and freethinkers among them – all of civil society . this infant democracy was harshly interrupted when martial law was imposed in December 1981 , with Solidarity outlawed and dissidents arrested .
they represented a full range of ideas and editorial styles – from factory leaflets and bulletins to intellectual magazines . hundreds of books prohibited by Communist censors ( for example , Gunther Grass ’ s The Tin Drum ) came to light .
with the economy in steep decline , Poland ’ s rulers began to seek to stabilize the political system and reestablish relations with the West . in 1986 , the government released political prisoners – a precondition for talks with the opposition .
instead , its democratic goals were to be fulfilled by a compromise with the authorities . Wałęsa and his closest advisers – Bronisław Geremek and Tadeusz Mazowiecki – pushed this moderate policy , demanding liberation while recognizing the political reality of Soviet domination .
two waves of strikes in 1988 forced General Jaruzelski ’ s government to negotiate with Solidarity , which , after a few months of hedging , was legalized . the “ Roundtable ” talks to change the political system could begin .
the Communists were guaranteed a majority in parliament . while the election to the newly created Senate was entirely free , the opposition could compete for only one-third of the seats in the Sejm ( the lower house ) .
solidarity gained the opportunity to create independent media and a grassroots political organization . finally , the Communists agreed that the elections to be held in four years would be entirely free .
Jaruzelski was elected president , but he had to accept the new division of power . the decisive political maneuver – building a coalition with allies of Communists – was carried out by Lech Wałęsa .
but it was civic activity - resistance movements , strikes , and other manifestations of social support – that buttressed Solidarity . Mikhail Gorbachev was important ; his non-intervention policy toward Eastern Europe meant that Soviet tanks would not annul the changes , as they had done with the Prague Spring .
handing over power to Solidarity was the last thing they had in mind . yet the Roundtable compromise turned out to be good even for them , as communist “ reformers ” began to build new careers in business and politics ( one , Aleksander Kwaśniewski , became Poland ’ s second democratically elected president ) .
this was an important sign for Poland ’ s neighbors in the Soviet bloc , which took its example to heart . in a few months , talks between Communist bosses and their democratic opponents ( often in the form of a roundtable ) paved the way to free elections and new democratic governments in Budapest , Prague , East Berlin , and Sofia .
since then , the symbol of the great revolution of 1989 has been the fall of the Berlin Wall . but the Roundtable talks in Warsaw 20 years ago this month is where the Iron Curtain began to be dismantled .
two Funerals and Our Freedom
soon , the gulag was virtually emptied ; a political thaw began , spurring whispers of freedom that could not be contained . in Poland and Hungary , in particular , an underground tide burst forth demanding change .
that first war among socialist states shattered the myth of inviolable “ fraternal ” bonds between the Soviet Union and the captive nations of Eastern Europe . but Khrushchev never envisioned the breakup of the Soviet empire as part of his thaw .
Béla Király , released from a sentence of life in prison ( one of the four death sentences he received from the communists having been commuted ) was offered the job of commander of the Hungarian National Guard and the defense of Budapest . his task was to knock the rag-tag freedom fighters into an army , but there wasn ’ t time to stop the Soviet advance .
over the years , a mutual friend often tried to introduce me to General Király , but , to my regret , that meeting never happened . any man who would frame the four death sentences he had received ( one signed by Khrushchev , another by Yuri Andropov , the Soviet ambassador in Budapest in 1956 ) and hang them in his drawing room has the sort of quirky humor I relish .
after all , when he learned that one of the Russian generals who had led the invasion was still alive in 2006 , Király invited him to Budapest to join the 50th anniversary celebrations . when General Yevgeni Malashenko declined in fear that he might be arrested , the 94-year-old Király flew to Moscow , where he spent a long weekend reminiscing and going to a banya for retired Red Army generals .
Kolakowski , modern Poland ’ s most acclaimed philosopher , quickly learned that mendacity was the true building block of Communism , and he withdrew from it in horror . by 1968 , the Polish regime could no longer tolerate his presence .
but today , Khrushchev is remembered mostly for his contribution to the demise of Stalinism – and , via Mikhail Gorbachev , whose hero he was , ultimately for helping to bring about communism ’ s demise . Király and Kolakowski became voices of moderation and reconciliation in the Hungary and Poland that emerged out of communism ’ s darkness at noon .
Király , Kolakowski , and Khrushchev : each in his own way is a symbol of today ’ s new and uniting Europe , a Europe of rapprochement and forgiveness among erstwhile opponents .
two Models for Europe
the sovereign-debt crisis is eating its way from the periphery to the core , and the exodus of capital is accelerating . since the summer , € 300 billion , in net terms , may well have fled from Italy and France .
the printing presses at the Banque de France and the Banca d ’ Italia are working overtime to make up for the outflow of money . but this only furthers the exodus , because creating more money prevents interest rates from rising to a point at which capital would find it attractive to stay .
if Europe had the same rules as the United States , where the Federal Reserve ’ s regional banks have to pay the Fed for any special money creation with securities collateralized in gold , they would not create this much supplementary money , and capital flight would be limited . instead , local printing of money is essentially aiding and abetting the exodus .
if the eurozone does not want to embrace capital controls , it has only two alternatives : make the local printing of money more difficult , or offer investment guarantees in countries that markets view as insecure .
the first option is the American way , which also demands that the buyers bear the risks inherent in public or private securities . the taxpayer is not called upon , even in extreme cases , and states can go bankrupt .
investment guarantees will lead , via issuance of Eurobonds , to socialization of the risks inherent in public debt . because all the member states provide one another with free credit guarantees , interest rates for government securities can no longer differ in accordance with creditworthiness or likelihood of repayment .
as long as banks – and thus governments , which sell their debt to the banks – can draw cheap credit up to any amount from the European System of Central Banks , Europe will remain volatile . the exodus of capital will continue , and enormous compensation claims of the European core ’ s central banks , particularly the German Bundesbank and the Dutch central bank , will pile up .
in Germany , these compensation claims amount to half of the country ’ s entire net foreign wealth , or € 500 billion ( $ 653 billion ) . since these claims would probably be lost should the euro collapse , the political pressure to give way finally to Eurobonds is becoming overwhelming .
the European Financial Stability Facility in Luxemburg would become a socialist planning agency , organizing flows of public capital in Europe and thwarting markets ’ allocative function . the consequence would be reduced growth , owing to a misallocation of scarce capital , and economic stagnation in the core areas .
matters are made no better by controlling credit flows via a fiscal government , which is what the eurozone countries have now decided they want . as long as the debtors co-determine the rules , more capital will flow under such an arrangement than markets would permit .
that distortion will become apparent even within the countries that benefit from the additional credit , because Eurobonds will , for the time being , provide security only for government debt . private debtors will continue to have difficulties finding capital , so the state will expand relative to the private sector .
but it is not a smooth road , because it threatens resistance by the capital-exporting countries ’ taxpayers and trade unions against the outflow of capital . in Germany , in particular , enormous resistance will build up if the country – via the introduction of Eurobonds – is driven back into the crisis that it underwent as a result of the interest-rate convergence that followed the introduction of the euro .
only the American alternative is viable . short- and long-term interest-rate spreads are determined by the economy ’ s creditworthiness , and whoever wants low interest rates has to provide real collateral .
the American route does not necessarily imply a heavy-handed approach vis-à-vis the crisis countries . it can be combined with a system of measured , limited help in the sense of partial coverage of investors against a country ’ s insolvency .
this model , contemplated by the European Economic Advisory Group at CESifo , would retain the disciplinary effects of interest-rate spreads while capping them in order to limit panicked extremes in the capital markets . it offers the last chance to avoid debt socialism .
Europe ’ s Two-Speed Future
Paris – For three years , the euro crisis has threatened not only to unravel the eurozone , but to bring down the entire European Union with it . although the pressure from financial markets has moderated , for now , a long-term resolution to the crisis remains an existential priority for the EU .
in today ’ s highly competitive global economy , European countries ’ relatively small size , aging populations , and excessive indebtedness , combined with a lack of energy resources and insufficient investment in research and development , mean that their high living standards and generous social-welfare states are in jeopardy . individually , they cannot compete with emerging markets ; they need a strong EU to face the challenges posed by globalization .
but the eurozone ’ s architecture – in which monetary policy is centralized , but budgetary and economic policies are left up to individual governments – is not viable in the long term . although Europe ’ s leaders have made some progress on institutional reform , the measures taken so far will not lead to real convergence of economic and budgetary policies , or to genuine economic union .
given that treaty change is politically unfeasible , establishing a “ two-speed Europe ” – in which a core group of countries pursues deeper integration more quickly than the rest – is the EU ’ s best option for reaching the level of cooperation needed to escape the crisis intact . this can be accomplished in two ways .
the first option would be to progress de facto toward a two-speed EU without establishing further legal commitments . eurozone countries , together with others willing to join the euro in the future ( the “ eurozone plus ” ) , could simply decide to use the legal means already available to increase cooperation .
the group could then extend cooperation to three other policy areas :
· &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; Minimal harmonization of tax laws ( such as a common basis for assessing corporate taxation ) and social policy ( such as further liberalization of national labor markets to encourage labor mobility ) ;
· &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; Common policy measures on immigration , linked to labor-market needs ;
· &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; Closer judicial cooperation – again aimed at encouraging mobility – in civil matters with cross-border implications , specifically concerning contracts and family law .
indeed , if all eurozone countries did not participate , such outside cooperation would be crucial , given that Articles 136 and 138 would no longer apply . this could include measures to strengthen the European Stability Mechanism and the Euro Plus Pact ( designed to enhance economic policy coordination among member states ) , de facto cooperation within the Bretton Woods institutions , and voluntary approximation of national laws in certain areas .
cooperation on matters related to the EU ’ s Economic and Monetary Union ( discipline and solidarity ) should be obligatory . the involvement of most , or all , current and future eurozone countries would enhance the group ’ s coherence , making it easier to win public support for cooperation in other areas .
pursuing this option would require that the decision-making process be legitimate . in the Council , as in all cases of “ enhanced cooperation , ” only participating members have the right to vote .
the second option would imply an international agreement , in addition to the EU treaties , which would legally bind participating countries , enabling them to commit to establishing a genuine economic union , and to define the organs and rules that will govern their cooperation .
such a treaty would take time to be negotiated , ratified , and implemented . but a clear , precise announcement of the decision to pursue it , together with a bold European Central Bank policy in line with its recently announced bond-purchasing program , might be enough to convince both financial markets and EU citizens that a lasting solution is within sight .
the eurozone ’ s path to genuine economic union will be fraught with political and institutional challenges – from determining substantive areas of cooperation to protecting the rights and interests of all EU countries and safeguarding the unity of both the internal market and foreign relations . but navigating that path is the EU ’ s only option .
two Wrongs Don ’ t Make a Right at the IMF and World Bank
one has go back to the “ Year of Three Popes ” ( 1978 ) to find a succession drama as strange as what has been happening at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , the two pillars of the global financial system . two months ago , Bank President Paul Wolfowitz resigned amidst an extraordinary staff mutiny and governance debacle .
to lose one international lending institution head is misfortune , to lose two looks like carelessness ( my apologies to Oscar Wilde ) . coming on the tenth year anniversary of the Asian financial crisis , the caldron in which today ’ s ultra-liquid capital markets were forged , conspiracy theories abound .
frankly , sticking to the public record , the two resignations seem like night and day . when Wolfowitz was finally pushed out after a bruising battle , Bank staff were beside themselves with joy .
Wolfowitz ’ s pre-Bank claim to fame was his role as an architect of the Iraq war , arguably one of the greatest strategic debacles since Napoleon ’ s invasion of Russia . Rato , by contrast , was Spain ’ s finance minister during the country ’ s best economic era since the sixteenth century .
under Rato , the IMF at least took some modest steps towards giving China and other rapidly emerging markets more say in running the place . at the same time as Rato pushed reluctant European nations to yield some of their power in the Fund , he introduced reforms that clarified and strengthened the Fund ’ s role in managing exchange rates .
indeed , a week before Rato ’ s resignation announcement , the Fund asserted that it had the right to censure countries whose intervention policies threaten to undermine global economic stability . the Fund ’ s policy change drew the ire of Chinese officials , who have been intervening on a biblical scale to hold down the value of their currency , the Yuan .
when the Fund gets the big boys to complain by saying perfectly sensible things , it must be doing something right . true , the Fund has been notably soft on the United States of late , downplaying the continuing vulnerabilities posed by the gaping US current account and trade deficits .
there is ample time between now and October for the IMF to install an open and fair selection process that will lead to the best person being chosen , regardless of nationality . central banks around the world have been enormously successful by choosing technocrats and people with proven knowledge and experience to head their institutions , rather than accepting purely political appointments .
a second similarity is that both institutions face deep existential crises . in today ’ s world of deep and liquid global financial markets , the main lending instruments of the IMF and and the Bank are largely unnecessary and redundant .
the BIS , founded in 1930 to help manage German reparation payments and to coordinate activities among central banks , served as little more than repository for gold reserves in the years following World War II . as central banks have gained status in recent years , and thanks to imaginative leadership , the BIS has reawakened and taken on a number of important roles , including setting international regulatory standards for global banking .
while it is encouraging to know that a hibernating IMF and World Bank may some day reawaken , it would be far better to see them invigorated now . a more globalized world needs global financial institutions , but ones that focus on coordination , supervision and technical advice , not redundant lending mechanisms .
the puzzling circumstances of the IMF head ’ s sudden departure announcement do not justify a business as usual approach to his replacement . nor does the closed-door succession process at the Bank , where the US continued its sixty year lock on the Presidency , justify continuing European monopolization of the Fund job .
the End of Work as We Know It
today , with some 200 million people worldwide out of work – 30 million more than in 2008 – Leontief ’ s words no longer seem as outlandish as they once did . indeed , there can be little doubt that technology is in the process of completely transforming the global labor market .
each time that machines yielded gains in efficiency ( including when tractors took over from horses ) , old jobs disappeared , but new jobs were created . furthermore , economists are number crunchers , and recent data show a slowdown – rather than an acceleration – in productivity gains .
to begin with , as noted by the MIT economist David Autor , advances in the automation of labor transform some jobs more than others . workers carrying out routine tasks like data processing are increasingly likely to be replaced by machines ; but those pursuing more creative endeavors are more likely to experience increases in productivity .
the resulting upheavals in the structure of the workforce can be at least as important as the actual number of jobs that are affected . economists call the most likely outcome of this phenomenon “ the polarization of employment . ”
in addition to the changes being wrought by automation , the job market is being transformed by digital platforms like Uber that facilitate exchanges between consumers and individual suppliers of services . a customer calling an Uber driver is purchasing not one service , but two : one from the company ( the connection to a driver whose quality is assured through customer ratings ) and the other from the driver ( transport from one location to another ) .
Uber and other digital platforms are redefining the interaction among consumers , workers , and employers . they are also making the celebrated firm of the industrial age – an essential institution , which allowed for specialization and saved on transactions costs – redundant .
this seemingly small change could have far-reaching consequences . rather than being regulated by a contract , the value of labor is being subjected to the same market forces buffeting any other commodity , as services vary in price depending on supply and demand .
instead of renting their set of skills and competences for a pre-set price , these young graduates prefer to maximize the lifetime income stream they may derive from their human capital . again , such behavior undermines the employment contract as a basic social institution and makes a number of its associated features , such as annual income taxation , suboptimal .
some might be tempted to resist – witness the recent clashes between taxi and Uber drivers in Paris and the lawsuits against the company in many countries . Uber ’ s arrangement may be fraudulent according to the existing legal framework , but that framework will eventually change .
rather than try to stop the unstoppable , we should think about how to put this new reality at the service of our values and welfare . in addition to rethinking institutions and practices predicated on traditional employment contracts – such as social security contributions – we will need to begin to invent new institutions that harness this technology-driven transformation for our collective benefit .
is Uber a Threat to Democracy ?
Aix-en-Provence – Every July , economists , business leaders , NGOs , and politicians from around the world gather in Aix-en-Provence , France , for the three-day Rencontres Économiques forum , organized by the Cercle des Économistes . this year ’ s forum focused on the changing nature of work .
the forum ’ s theme was undoubtedly selected partly in response to fears that technological advances will lead to widespread unemployment , as machines become advanced enough to replace humans in performing an increasing number of tasks . as MIT ’ s Andrew McAfee pointed out , historically , technological revolutions have “ eventually led to more , if different , jobs ” ; but , with machines becoming increasingly intelligent , “ this time may be different . ”
given this possibility , McAfee suggests , we may need to re-build our societies so that , as intelligent machines increase productivity , the declining demand for human work has welfare-enhancing outcomes like higher ( and more equitably distributed ) incomes and more leisure time . he is not alone : John Maynard Keynes predicted this possibility 85 years ago .
taxi drivers in France and around the world are particularly incensed about UberPOP ( called UberX outside Europe ) , a no-frills service . Uber has since withdrawn UberPOP from France , at least temporarily – though not before two of its top managers were arrested for ignoring the government ’ s injunction to suspend UberPOP .
Uber ’ s software , in a sense , does the job of thousands of Walrasian auctioneers acting locally in space and time , leading to almost perfect price discrimination . airlines have long employed such price discrimination , offering multiple prices for the same distance flown , depending on date and time .
this leads to a clear increase in efficiency and provides overall income gains . even if losers were fully compensated , the sum of the gains – shared by the firm , its mostly part-time workers , and its customers – would far outweigh the losses .
while this problem always arises when disruptive new technologies appear , innovation and adoption are occurring faster than ever . taxi drivers are being asked to adjust in a matter of days , rather than years , leaving democratic systems little time to determine how much compensation they should receive , and how it should be distributed .
to level the playing field , local or national authorities should require the company to integrate tax-collection software into its app . the fact that UberPOP drivers , unlike taxi drivers , do not cover passenger insurance also amounts to unfair competition , and must be remedied .
moreover , in France , taxi drivers must undergo regular health and professional tests , to which UberPOP drivers are not subject . like all Uber drivers , they are “ monitored ” by users , who evaluate them through the app after each ride .
the final problem with innovative companies like Uber is that the financial returns overwhelmingly accrue to the company ’ s leadership , rather than to the service providers . whether or not that is justified , such companies ’ contribution to rising income inequality – and thus to regulatory capture , media bias , and disproportionate influence in elections – cannot be ignored .
the creative destruction of the so-called “ second machine age ” cannot and should not be stopped . but to think that markets alone can manage its transformative impact is pure folly – a fact that the recent global economic crisis , which was rooted in unbridled financial innovation , made clear .
Uganda ’ s Smart Protectionism
Kampala – On a balmy afternoon , I met Dr. Gilbert Bukenya at his home on the shores of Lake Victoria , where we talked about the future of farming in Uganda . “ By farming smarter , ” he said , “ Ugandans not only can grow more , they can earn more money . ”
an advocate of food self-sufficiency for Uganda , Bukenya wants Ugandans to eat more homegrown rice , thereby boosting local farmers and rice millers while freeing hard cash for higher uses . Bukenya has long promoted a new strain of African rice that grows in uplands ( as opposed to wetland paddies ) and requires less water .
once rice output began to expand , Bukenya and other Ugandan politicians played another smart card : they lobbied successfully for a 75 % duty on foreign rice , which stimulated rice production further . rice output has risen by two and a half times since 2004 , according to the Ministry of Trade , to 180,000 metric tons , while consumption of imported rice fell by half from 2004 to 2005 alone .
Uganda ’ s importers , seeing the shift , have invested in new mills in the country , expanding employment and creating competition for farmers ’ output , improving prices . new mills , meanwhile , lowered the cost of bringing domestic rice to market , so that consumers now still pay about the same for rice as they always have .
and Uganda is poised to start exporting rice within East Africa and beyond . “ It ’ s a very important crop for raising income and commercializing agriculture , ” says Nelson Gagawala Wambuzi , Minister of State for Trade .
Uganda ’ s success in expanding rice production is especially interesting given that the people of sub-Saharan Africa spend nearly $ 2 billion a year on rice grown outside of Africa . the amount of spending on rice alone by Africans equals the combined national budgets of Ghana and Senegal .
but such spending on imported rice is a scandal , because , with the help of wise policies , African farmers could grow much more rice , perhaps enough to eliminate virtually all imports . much of the rice grown in Pakistan , Vietnam , and especially America is stimulated by subsidies , and then dumped into African markets at low prices – sometimes below the cost of production .
African governments sharply reduced or eliminated duties on imported rice in the 1990 ’ s , urged on by the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , and influential free-market economists . the assumption was that rich countries would reciprocate by curtailing subsidies to their farmers .
but rice duties are working in Uganda – and in Nigeria , where rice output is also soaring and the value of imported rice is declining – and policymakers rightly believe that they must be maintained . the big exporters , such as the US and Vietnam , continue to supply massive subsidies to their rice farmers .
indeed , African governments might wish to look selectively at other crops . they need to rely on a mix of economic tools , including farm protectionism , aimed at helping indigenous producers .
virtually every successful Asian economy was built on selective trade barriers – and in China and India , the world ’ s two fastest growing economies , such barriers remain in place . even Korea and Japan maintain massive duties on imported rice simply to protect the livelihoods of their own rice farmers .
and selective protectionism is of course no panacea for Africa , even when such policies effectively aid local producers . but economic self-reliance is a worthy goal for most African countries , and Uganda ’ s experience suggests the potential of an approach long denigrated by the international community .
for too long , African governments have listened to the siren song of free trade – and have suffered from too much openness , not too little . with the US and the European Union unwilling to slash their farm subsidies , Uganda ’ s rice experiment deserves wider attention , if only because it shows that Africans aren ’ t merely passive victims of international economic forces .
David Cameron ’ s Europe
Stockholm – The next 18-24 months are likely to decide the shape of Europe for decades to come , and the United Kingdom has now started the clock on that process . reelected with a resounding – and entirely unexpected – majority in the House of Commons , Prime Minister David Cameron must now use his increased mandate to set out an EU reform package that is attractive to all member states .
in a series of speeches over recent years , Cameron has spoken about a European reform agenda centered on increasing the EU ’ s competitiveness and improving its institutions ’ transparency . in the wake of Russian revanchism and the mayhem spreading across the Middle East , were Cameron to speak today of the changes that Europe needs to make , I would hope that he would add his support for more effective common foreign and security policies .
this will be a process in which the EU ’ s 28 member states , rather than the European Commission , must be in command . only by appealing to and involving the EU ’ s national political institutions can EU reform succeed .
then again , no opinion polls predicted that the general election would result in a majority Conservative government . so no one should be under any illusion about the risks inherent in any British referendum on EU membership .
the Union can do its part in the coming 18 months by demonstrating its ability to deliver not only a potent reform package , but also implement other key policies , such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the United States and the Digital Single Market . success in such areas , and the economic benefits they will bring , will make leaving the EU even more unattractive for the UK .
but a UK decision to leave , should it come to that , would initiate a painful and complicated process of negotiating an exit and agreeing on some sort of new relationship . there would be no attractive options , and the result – regardless of how much goodwill both sides bring to the talks – would leave both the UK and the EU visibly diminished , not least on the world stage .
on the contrary , British withdrawal would likely inspire similar moves in other countries , with the risk that the EU , already weakened , might begin to fragment . and , given his current efforts to divide Europe , one can be sure that Russian President Vladimir Putin would do all that he can to encourage , and finance , such a split .
during this period , the EU would also have to address the ongoing challenges to its eastern neighbors , particularly Ukraine , posed by Putin ’ s revisionism , as well as the meltdown of much of its southern neighborhood in the Middle East and North Africa . in this context , a weakened and fractured Europe – unable to confront threats stemming from its immediate environment – would be a more dangerous place to live .
Cameron ’ s remarkable victory should be viewed as an opportunity to launch a renewed and reformed EU in the next two years . the UK ’ s European partners expect Cameron to frame the debate that must now begin if a truly stronger EU – one that can face up to its future and its future challenges – is to emerge .
Britain by Itself
London – The United Kingdom ’ s general election is a little more than a month away , but already the campaign seems to have been with us forever , rolling implacably forward , but with little evidence of any genuine excitement – or even significant movement in the polls . support for the two main contenders – the Labour Party and the ruling Conservative Party – seems stuck in the low-to-mid 30s .
maybe they are right ; they deserve to be . in the meantime , Labour seems to be hoping for who-knows-what to turn the tide , while keeping their collective fingers crossed that they will not be eviscerated in Scotland , where the Scottish National Party is threatening to sweep the board .
Prime Minister David Cameron has said that a referendum is needed in order to prevent the country from sleepwalking toward an accidental and disastrous EU exit . and so it must come as a surprise to some of Britain ’ s EU partners that none of the country ’ s politicians seems to be making any effort to wake a somnambulant public .
more broadly , while much of the world seems to be going to hell in a handbasket , there has been little talk about Britain ’ s international role and responsibilities . the UK was once famous for punching above its weight in global affairs , but perhaps the country no longer really matters much – if only because it does not want to matter .
the closest anyone has come to putting some international fizz into the campaign was when US President Barack Obama fired a couple of warning shots across the UK ’ s bow . the Obama administration seems bent on proving that the so-called “ special relationship ” goes beyond raucous backslapping .
in any case , it is doubtful that anyone in London will take much notice . these days , policy on China is driven entirely by the Treasury , which subscribes to the view that one can do business with the Chinese only from a position of servility .
the criticism was directed at all European members of NATO , but it was clear that the US government believes that Britain bears a special responsibility to maintain its military commitments . the UK has a long track record of scolding its European NATO partners for not spending the 2 % of GDP that each has pledged to dedicate to defense ; now it appears that Britain itself risks falling short .
the British economy is now growing fast by current European standards , so 2 % of GDP is becoming a larger sum . ( the same is true of the UK ’ s similar commitment to the United Nations to spend 0.7 % of its GDP on international development assistance . )
government officials presumably recognize the embarrassment that would be caused were Britain to fall short of the 2 % target , so they seem to be looking for programs that can be squeezed into the Defense Department ’ s budget to pad spending . this is exactly the sort of behavior the UK has criticized in others : lumping all sorts of pension payments and intelligence commitments into their calculations of defense spending .
the fact that neither of the major parties is prepared to make the case for increasing defense spending sends the wrong sort of message to Russian President Vladimir Putin . the proper response to Russian adventurism in Ukraine should not only be to work with the rest of the EU to help the government in Kyiv steady its economy ; it should also include ramping up defense spending and convincing NATO members to do the same .
it is unfortunate that some of the most important issues facing the UK are being ignored in the country ’ s current election campaign . whatever the outcome when voters head to the polls on May 7 , the next government will have to deal with reality .
keeping Europe ’ s Eastern Promise
Kyiv – For many years , the European Union ’ s eastward expansion seemed unstoppable . but with Russia ’ s invasion of Ukraine , President Vladimir Putin appears to have succeeded in ordering a halt to Europe ’ s efforts to extend democracy , the rule of law , and open markets throughout the continent .
Ukraine ’ s fate has become Europe ’ s fate . indeed , Putin not only wants to stop European political , civic , and social norms from taking root within Ukraine ; he wants to roll them back in the Baltics , the Balkans , and anywhere else in Europe made politically brittle by economic crisis and / or demagogic populism .
the EU Eastern Partnership summit in Riga can and must demonstrate Europe ’ s determination to defend its unity , security , and values in the face of Russian aggression . and it must do so in concrete ways , not simply with quickly forgotten official communiqués for which the Kremlin and its Ukrainian separatist proxies have only contempt .
the citizens of the partner countries must become the real beneficiaries if this partnership is to become more than the inert agreement that it has been . generous EU commitments on mobility , aid to SMEs and entrepreneurs , and a vast increase in educational opportunities are among the key ingredients that could make such a partnership politically popular for a vast majority .
Ukraine should be the centerpiece of any effort to revive the Eastern Partnership as a way to attract the support of Europeans who remain outside the EU . yes , the news from my country remains bad .
although Ukraine ’ s economy is no longer in free-fall , as it was last winter , GDP has declined by a quarter since Russian troops first invaded in February 2014 . official unemployment now stands at over 10 % , compared to 7.3 % before Russia ’ s occupation and annexation of Crimea .
in the face of such calamitous conditions , Ukraine ’ s government is a bit like the proverbial Dutch boy who put his finger in a dike to stop the sea from leaking through . despite herculean efforts , more leaks continue to appear .
despite the depth of Ukraine ’ s plight , Europe cannot avoid taking up the challenge that Putin has set before it . after all , if Putin succeeds in turning Ukraine into a failed state with a frozen conflict embedded within it , he will seek the same outcome all along the EU ’ s borders , from Estonia to Greece .
fortunately , the EU has a real partner in Ukraine , whose people ’ s devotion to Europe has been tested by snipers in the streets of Kyiv and now by the Russian army . their courage , and their newfound political activism , has stiffened the government ’ s backbone in implementing needed reforms and made it impossible for any political actor in Ukraine to buck the pro-EU consensus .
yet , given the war in the eastern Donbas region , the shattering of so much of our economy , and the precarious nature of our government ’ s finances , the International Monetary Fund and others are clearly asking too much of Ukrainians . the idea that Ukraine can embrace the economic “ shock therapy ” that Poland pursued a quarter-century ago is the type of cookie-cutter policymaking that resulted in the 2008 global financial crisis .
that is why the Eastern Partnership , if it is to be renewed , must embrace bold new initiatives for Ukraine , and not try to reheat old policies designed for very different circumstances . a recent report from the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies provides some guidance concerning what the EU should now try to do for Ukraine .
for starters , the EU should help us create a more stable exchange-rate regime to overcome the currency volatility that has wracked our economy since Russia ’ s invasion . and , although fiscal consolidation is necessary , given the state of our economy , Ukraine ’ s most vulnerable people are now enduring a hand-to-mouth existence .
after all , it was to secure that agreement that young Ukrainians braved former President Viktor Yanukovych ’ s snipers , and are now braving the might of the Russian army . to follow through would do more to anchor Ukrainians ’ confidence in their European future , and to convince the Kremlin that it cannot succeed in rolling back European values , than anything else the EU might do .
since Russia ’ s invasion , FDI into Ukraine has collapsed , which is precisely what Putin wants . the EU can demonstrate its commitment to Ukraine ’ s economic renewal by having the European Investment Bank invest in a showcase infrastructure project , say improved rail links to the EU .
the EU faces a stark choice : a renewed Eastern Partnership or a renewed division of Europe .
last Chance for Ukraine and Europe
London – The European Union stands at a crossroads . the shape it takes five years from now will be decided in the coming 3-5 months .
year after year , the EU has successfully muddled through its difficulties . but now it has to deal with two sources of existential crisis : Greece and Ukraine .
Greece ’ s long-festering crisis has been mishandled by all parties from the outset . emotions now are running so high that muddling through is the only constructive alternative .
it is a black-and-white case . Vladimir Putin ’ s Russia is the aggressor , and Ukraine , in defending itself , is defending the values and principles on which the EU was built .
that is the wrong approach , and it is producing the wrong results . Putin is gaining ground in Ukraine , and Europe is so preoccupied with Greece that it hardly pays any attention .
Putin ’ s preferred outcome in Ukraine is to engineer a financial and political collapse that destabilizes the country , and for which he can disclaim responsibility , rather than a military victory that leaves him in possession of – and responsible for – part of Ukraine . he has shown this by twice converting a military victory into a ceasefire .
the deterioration in Ukraine ’ s position between the two ceasefire agreements – Minsk I , negotiated last September , and Minsk II , completed in February – shows the extent of Putin ’ s success . but that success is temporary , and Ukraine is too valuable an ally for the EU to abandon .
there is something fundamentally wrong with EU policy . how else could Putin ’ s Russia have outmaneuvered Ukraine ’ s allies , which used to lead the free world ?
as a result , Ukraine barely survives , while Putin has the first-mover advantage . he can choose between hybrid war and hybrid peace , and Ukraine and its allies are struggling to respond .
the financial collapse of which I had been warning for months occurred in February , when the hryvnia ’ s value plummeted 50 % in a few days , and the National Bank of Ukraine had to inject large amounts of money to rescue the banking system . the climax was reached on February 25 , when the central bank introduced import controls and raised interest rates to 30 % .
since then , President Petro Poroshenko ’ s jawboning has brought the exchange rate back close to the level on which Ukraine ’ s 2015 budget was based . but the improvement is extremely precarious .
this temporary collapse has shaken public confidence and endangered the balance sheets of Ukrainian banks and companies that have hard-currency debts . it has also undermined the calculations on which Ukraine ’ s programs with the International Monetary Fund are based .
but EU member states , facing their own fiscal constraints , have shown no willingness to consider additional bilateral aid . so Ukraine continues to teeter on the edge of the abyss .
at the same time , a radical reform program within Ukraine is gaining momentum , and slowly becoming visible to both the Ukrainian public and the European authorities . there is a stark contrast between the deteriorating external situation and the continuing progress in internal reforms .
many people expect that this would mark the beginning of Cold War II . the likelier outcome is that a victorious Putin would have many friends in Europe , and that the sanctions on Russia would be allowed to lapse .
that is the worst possible outcome for Europe , which would become even more divided , turning into a battleground for influence between Putin ’ s Russia and the United States . the EU would cease to be a functioning political force in the world ( especially if Greece also left the eurozone ) .
a more likely scenario is that Europe muddles through by drip-feeding Ukraine . Ukraine does not collapse , but the oligarchs reassert themselves and the new Ukraine begins to resemble the old Ukraine .
but his victory would be less secure , as it would lead to a second Cold War that Russia would lose , just as the Soviet Union lost the first . Putin ’ s Russia needs oil at $ 100 a barrel and will start running out of currency reserves in 2-3 years .
the latest chapter in what I call the “ Tragedy of the European Union ” is that the EU will lose the new Ukraine . the principles that Ukraine is defending – the very principles on which the EU is based – will be abandoned , and the EU will have to spend a lot more money on defending itself than it would need to spend helping the new Ukraine succeed .
though Ukraine , on its own , is no match for Russia ’ s military might , its allies could decide to do “ whatever it takes ” to help , short of becoming involved in a direct military confrontation with Russia or violating the Minsk agreement . doing so would not only help Ukraine ; it would also help the EU to recapture the values and principles that it seems to have lost .
the Right Intervention in Ukraine
Stockholm – The ongoing Greek drama may have transfixed Europe and the world , but the great crisis in Europe ’ s east has not gone away . Ukraine remains under partial occupation by Russian-backed separatists , with intermittent fighting still taking place , despite the Minsk II ceasefire agreement .
if Russia is serious about seeking a solution to the conflict , it should be prepared to endorse the deployment of an international peacekeeping mission and force . such a mission could begin the process of rehabilitating the region , allow those displaced by the violence to return , and facilitate the reintegration of the Donbas into Ukraine with appropriate safeguards and devolved powers .
two decades ago , the international community was entering the final phase of efforts to secure peace in Bosnia . but there were also lingering conflicts in Croatia , notably in the Eastern Slavonia region , adjacent to Serbia .
but the most important area , Sector East in Eastern Slavonia , remained under firm Serb control . and , much like Russian President Vladimir Putin on the Ukraine issue today , Serbia ’ s then-president , Slobodan Milošević , insisted that the issue could be resolved only by direct talks between the Serb separatists and the Croat government in Zagreb .
the reality , of course , was that the Serb separatists were entirely dependent on the political , military , and economic support of Milošević ’ s Serbia . and , in the end , Milošević agreed to the deployment of a UN mission and force , which was tasked with ensuring the region ’ s demilitarization and return to Croat sovereignty , after implementing the necessary safeguards for the Serbs living there .
today , the UNTAES ( United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja , and Western Sirmium ) mission is virtually forgotten – not because it failed , but because it succeeded . to be sure , not every issue in Eastern Slavonia was sorted out then or in the years since ; but there is no longer a conflict , and Croatia and Serbia now enjoy constructive bilateral relations .
this could be a model for the separatist-controlled areas of Donbas if the political will is there to make such an arrangement work . but is the Kremlin serious about recognizing Ukraine ’ s sovereignty in the Donbas and resuming normal relations with the West ?
it is worth bearing in mind that Russia has driven every step toward escalation in this conflict – including the establishment of the separatist enclaves . indeed , the Kremlin appears to be waiting for Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko ’ s government to fail and the West to split on the issue and stop taking an interest in its resolution .
but if Ukraine ’ s government and the West remain united , the Kremlin might see that its enclaves in Donbas represent a threat mainly to Russia itself . after all , the grim reality is that the separatist enclaves are in economic free-fall , with their societies becoming increasingly criminalized .
absent any other arrangement , the Kremlin will have to do just that . former US Secretary of State Colin Powell ’ s doctrine – if you break it , you own it – applies to Putin ’ s intervention in Ukraine as much as to George W. Bush ’ s misadventure in Iraq .
there certainly are very difficult issues that must be sorted out before a peacekeeping mission could go into Donbas , notably the composition and formal mandate of whatever force is deployed . but , again , if the will is there , these questions should not be intractable .
such a mission could then ensure the real implementation of the political provisions of the Minsk II agreement . genuinely free and fair local elections , with the participation of all displaced people and refugees , will never be possible without a substantial international presence .
the Milošević regime then sounded exactly like the Kremlin now . but tomorrow really is another day , and it is certainly not too early to start exploring options that promise not just to manage the conflict , but to resolve it .
such an intervention might work – but only if and when both sides genuinely want a solution . we are not there yet .
a Way Out for Ukraine and Russia
London – The leaders of Russia and Ukraine will meet in Astana , Kazakstan , on January 15 to discuss , once again , an end to the fighting that has roiled eastern Ukraine ’ s Donbas region since last spring . hopes for a viable agreement are not high .
one reason why the crisis in Ukraine has proved so difficult to overcome is that its roots stretch far outside the country ’ s borders . finding a genuine solution will require the resolution of a dispute between Russia and the West that dates back to the 1990s , before Russian President Vladimir Putin came to power .
at its heart , the conflict in Ukraine is about a disagreement over NATO ’ s expansion into what Russia regards as its “ near abroad . ” Fortunately , a solution is possible – but it will require a reworking of Europe ’ s security architecture .
that is a promise that Western countries will be unable to provide . for them , what is at stake is the principle that sovereign countries have the right to chart their own course , rather than be entangled in a larger power ’ s sphere of influence .
indeed , it was this principle that , once invoked to justify NATO enlargement in the 1990s , put the two sides on a collision course . with Russia ’ s neighbors free to join the alliance , the natural result could only be a new dividing line , one pressing up against the Russian Federation ’ s western and southern borders .
for the West , a revamped CFE Treaty would help mitigate worries about military threats in the area that Russia has traditionally considered its sphere of influence . violations of the treaty would be easily detectable and allow time for the West to deploy countermeasures .
for Russia , a new treaty would allow it to live with the hitherto nightmare scenario of Ukrainian accession to NATO ; as long as the pact remained in force , Ukraine ’ s membership would have no military consequences . NATO , at least in the Russian hinterland , would become first and foremost a political organization .
for Russia , this would mean a significant improvement on what it has been offered since the end of the Cold War . though invitations by the West to join organizations such as the NATO-Russia Council or the G-8 may have been symbolically important and thus politically valuable , these venues provide only forums for discussion ; they do not produce binding agreements .
it would eliminate the primary motive behind Russia ’ s support for separatism in the country ’ s southeast : ensuring that Ukraine remains ineligible for NATO membership . the dispute over the fate of Crimea would continue ; but an agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the issue could be made a precondition of the treaty ’ s entry into full effect .
that should not stop the West from making the offer . with the Russian economy in serious trouble , Putin may be looking for a way out of his corner .
the second objection is that the West would be best served by simply standing back and watching while sanctions and plunging oil prices bring down Russia ’ s economy – and ultimately Putin himself . but this would be an irresponsibly dangerous and ultimately counterproductive strategy .
why Ukraine Needs Weapons
Munich – It has become something of a mantra among diplomats and other foreign-policy analysts that there is no military solution to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine . the only viable path to peace and stability , observers almost unanimously proclaim , is a diplomatic one .
of course , from Ukraine &apos;s perspective , a one-on-one military confrontation with Russia is not a viable option . last year , when separatist forces in the Donbas region appeared to be crumbling under the weight of Ukraine &apos;s counter-offensive , it seemed possible that Ukraine would be able to reassert its sovereignty over the area .
the move exemplifies Russia &apos;s commitment to do whatever it takes to prevent a military defeat of the separatist entities that it has incited and forged into fighting units – a determination that has endured , even as the conflict has placed considerable strain on its armed forces . given this , the prospects for Ukraine to reassert control over the Donbas region militarily are so slim that even trying to do so would be foolish .
if one considers the strategic ambitions of the separatists and their Russian patrons , Ukraine &apos;s prospects are even bleaker . beyond supplying the separatist groups with heavy and advanced weapons , and deploying special units and forces to support them , Russia now appears to be sending in “ volunteers &quot; to train a separatist army that could ultimately go on the offensive .
such an army , separatist leaders hope , will enable them – at the very least – to secure control over the Donbas region . they would then be positioned to secure a “ Novorossiya &quot; statelet extending along the entire Black Sea coast , up to and including Odessa .
to prevent this scenario from unfolding , a robust political dialogue with the Kremlin is clearly vital , as are continued economic sanctions to make clear that Russia will pay a rising price for ongoing aggression . but trusting solely in a diplomatic dialogue and sanctions to bring about a lasting peace may be excessively optimistic .
but perhaps even more important is backing for reforms aimed at eliminating corruption and promoting growth . the recent agreement with the International Monetary Fund is of immediate importance in this respect , and the agreement with the European Union on a Deep and Comprehensive Free-Trade Area is crucial to the country &apos;s long-term transformation .
but if separatist groups , with support from Russia , believe that they can control Donbas and the Black Sea coast , efforts to rebuild Ukraine &apos;s society and economy will amount to little . that is why Ukraine &apos;s external partners must also help to strengthen the country &apos;s defensive capabilities .
but the greater concern is the behavior of pragmatists , who identify weaknesses that can be exploited . if the Russian-backed separatists view Ukraine &apos;s defensive capacity as a serious weakness , there will be little to compel them not to push forward in pursuit of their ambitions .
security experts should identify which actions powers like the US and Europe could take to improve Ukraine &apos;s defensive capabilities . the requests for non-lethal equipment made by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko at the recent Munich Security Conference could provide some guidance .
but a year of talks and failed agreements has demonstrated that there is no purely diplomatic solution either . only by eliminating – or at least seriously diminishing – the potential for the separatists and their Russian backers to continue their military campaign can Ukraine and its partners hope for a lasting political solution .
Ukraine ’ s Dollar Addiction
although prices are increasing around the world , Ukraine ’ s inflation is extreme , twice as much as in neighboring Russia . amazingly , instead of dampening inflation , Ukraine ’ s central bank is stoking it .
Ukraine ’ s prices started spiraling out of control around the time when Yuliya Tymoshenko returned as prime minister last December . malicious observers suggest that she is to blame for pursuing populist social expenditures .
state finances are generally in good shape , with public debt at just 11 % of GDP . according to the National Bank of Ukraine ( NBU ) , international reserves have grown steadily and now stand at $ 33 billion .
when the dollar falls in value , as it has , Ukraine ’ s very open economy imports inflation . in the last year , the dollar ’ s value dropped by 12 % against the euro , which is a more important currency than the dollar in Ukraine ’ s foreign trade .
the International Monetary Fund has persistently warned Ukraine that its dollar peg could cause a financial crisis because of over- or undervaluation , and for years has called on Ukraine to free its exchange rate . but the NBU refused to do so – making Ukraine the last country in Central and Eastern Europe to tie its currency to the dollar .
Ukraine ’ s powerful industrialists praised the NBU ’ s low exchange-rate policy , believing it makes the country more competitive . they ignore the fact that the NBU can control only the nominal appreciation of the hryvnia .
Ukraine ’ s current refinance rate is 16 % a year , 10 % less than inflation , which means that Ukraine has a negative real interest rate of 10 % a year . as a result , Ukraine ’ s money supply , M3 , exploded by no less than 52 % in the last year , which points to inflation hitting 30 % soon .
the NBU ’ s leadership understands that it must act to contain inflation , but its insistence on the dollar peg ties their hands , because it prevents them from raising interest rates sufficiently . instead , they have reverted to strict reserve requirements , effectively rationing credit and thereby causing a domestic credit squeeze in the midst of the current international financial crisis , which is likely to force some medium-sized banks into bankruptcy because of liquidity problems .
incompetence is one reason , but politics is probably the decisive cause . the NBU is subordinate to President Viktor Yushchenko , who , despite naming Tymoshenko as prime minister , seems more interested in harming her politically than in capping inflation .
even now , in the midst of an inflationary crisis , the NBU wants to move in small steps , evidently failing to grasp the severity of the crisis . the NBU needs to announce that it no longer has an exchange-rate target and that it will stop intervening by ending its purchases of dollars on the currency market .
if the NBU lets the exchange rate float , Ukrainians are likely to exchange billions of dollars into hryvnia , driving up the hryvnia exchange rate . that would contain Ukraine ’ s inflation , as the NBU could restrict the money supply through high interest rates rather than rationing .
the great economist Rudi Dornbusch used to say that a financial crisis usually starts much later than anyone expects , but then develops faster than anyone can imagine . Ukraine is on the financial precipice .
Yushchenko and the NBU can still act , but if they do not do so immediately , a costly and unnecessary financial crisis might ensue . as prime minister , Yushchenko saved his country from financial default in early 2000 .
Ukraine ’ s Orange Christmas
for our movement is a triumph , not of mobs but of joyous crowds ; of protests , not of looting ; of clear purpose , not confusion . as a result , something new will color the habits of those who govern Ukraine from now on : respect for individuals , which is the ultimate check on the abuse of power .
they have reason to be proud . self-confidence among the governed and caution among the rulers : these are the psychological springs of democracy and true freedom , and they can never again be diverted in our homeland .
this left the regime to choose between using force to quell the growing resistance or cutting its losses . by refusing to leave the streets and squares of Kyiv , Ukraine ’ s mass volunteer army of democrats forced our country ’ s gray old men of the past to retreat into the past .
for 70 cynical years , and for centuries before that , everything done in the name of Ukrainians was done without our consent . corrupt regimes , through intimidation and bribery , insisted on the loyalty of the bureaucracy , police , and armed services .
from now on , the force of ideas , not the force of arms , will win the day . for once , Karl Marx , the mischievous cause of so much of Ukraine ’ s misery , got something right : “ the point , ” he said about the world , “ is to change it . ”
of course , our movement was created out of opposition : opposition to corruption , opposition to surrendering our national independence , opposition to the rule of the bully . the joy of opposition is its simplicity ;
now we must lead a nation in which – thanks to the cynical ploys and hate-filled rhetoric of a discredited regime – some sections seem to be set against the democracy we seek to build . but no section of Ukraine is our enemy and none will be treated that way .
thus , our first task is legal and judicial reform , and here we are given hope by the courage of Ukraine ’ s Supreme Court , which in overturning the stolen election of November 21 upheld the law and the liberties of Ukrainians against a regime determined to sweep them away . so we will resist the temptation of revenge and retribution .
ruling in the national interest , rather than for the benefit of favored sections or clans , we will apply the law equally to our supporters and our opponents . we will be guided , and bound , by the rule of law – and the spirit of ordered liberty that animates it .
yes , Ukraine has Ukrainian speakers and it has Russian speakers ; yes , it has Orthodox and Catholics . but those divisions were manipulated with the same sort of cynicism that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman used to pit Serbs , Croats , and Bosnian against each other in the former Yugoslavia .
we are united as a people and in our shared history of suffering . having laid the foundations of genuine democracy , our house will not be divided by anyone .
Ukraine ’ s Own Goal
Kyiv – Politics and sports are often an incendiary mix , as the controversy now swirling around the Euro 2012 football championship , to be co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland , demonstrates . German Chancellor Angela Merkel , European Commission President José Manuel Barroso , and other European Union leaders have said that they will boycott matches held in Ukraine , owing to the imprisonment of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and other opposition figures .
why , two decades after communism ended and Ukraine gained its independence , does the country remain mired in economic torpor and an authoritarian politics that has aroused such ire in Europe ? when a country like Ukraine develops slowly and remains poor , it is not because of natural disaster or resource constraints .
contrary to what many Western economists think , the worst economic breakdowns are not the result of free markets gone haywire , but of excessive concentration of political power . to insure against the worst human and economic catastrophes , limits to political power must be introduced and a system of checks and balances maintained .
Poland ’ s GDP has almost doubled over the last 20 years , while Ukraine is still barely maintaining the output level recorded during the last year of socialism . generally speaking , Central and Eastern European countries have performed better economically than the ex-Soviet countries ( with the exception of the Baltic states ) .
child mortality rates have declined in all Central European countries over the past 20 years , especially in Poland , where the rate fell from 17 per 10,000 live births to seven . in the Czech Republic and Slovenia , life expectancy has increased from 71 to 77 , similar to other Central European countries .
in Ukraine , by contrast , under-five child mortality rates have fallen only slightly , from 25 per 10,000 live births to 24 , while life expectancy has declined from 70 years to 68 . the same stagnation applies to Russia .
the post-communist record shows that the countries that reformed most successfully are also the most democratic – indeed , as democratic as any in the West . the worst economic outcomes in the region are found in countries that have diverged from democracy .
democracy is not a panacea , but non-democratic regimes usually pursue worse economic polices than democratic governments do . the former engage in predatory and unpredictable regulation , which produces a bad business environment .
moreover , corruption payments should be added to official taxation . it may turn out that most businesses are hit by heavy taxation of both varieties – so heavy that the economy cannot grow , as appears to be the case in Ukraine .
they may pay lower taxes , or their competitors may be subject to raids by the authorities . because the state uses its apparatus to deter competition – both informally , through arbitrary enforcement of property rights , and formally , through trade restrictions – crony capitalism is not only unjust , but also inefficient .
a key ingredient of Poland ’ s success in the last 20 years was a clear separation , from the very beginning of the post-communist transition , between politics and business . there were uniform rules and equal protection for everyone .
this is true of the recent boom-bust sequence in Spain , Ireland , the United States , the United Kingdom , Bulgaria , and the Baltics , among others . in Ukraine , too , a huge boom in 2004-2007 was followed by a contraction amounting to almost 15 % GDP in 2009 – a direct result of domestic policies .
and , to do that , an energetic civil society must demand an end to crony capitalism . Ukraine ’ s citizens can become more like their Central European neighbors , or they can allow the economy ’ s many distortions from past bad policies to persist , in which case they will fall further behind .
Ukraine ’ s Struggle for Law
belief in a government answerable to the people and in a transparent market purged of insider dealing no longer guides government policy . instead , the ideals for which we struggled appear as slogans invoked by those who want to protect their vested interests .
cynics explain this by saying that our AOrange ” ideals were never anything but the rationalizations of one set of oligarchs struggling to overthrow another . once masters of the situation , it is said , the zeal of those who promised reform mutated into a zeal to preserve their private wealth and that of their friends .
a year ago , everyone gathered in the streets of Kyiv knew what we were standing up against : a corrupt government that sought to command life and labor , and to dispose of state property , at its will . in so far as formal legal rights existed , no court could be relied upon to enforce those rights when our rulers saw their interests as challenged .
instead , those who benefited from the regime = s corruptions insisted that their rights to the property they had stolen were inviolate . these crony capitalists argue that , if they are left alone to develop their assets , they will make the country prosperous .
an economy that appears arbitrary and illegitimate in the eyes of the majority of people may , for a time , run on the false confidence of easy profits . corruption , however , is inevitable because the rule of law , which is the market = s ultimate guarantor , depends on the consent of all its participants and their belief in its core fairness .
a radical lawlessness was at the heart of Ukraine ’ s privatization process . so we must not be tricked by the fact that those who gained economic power by looting state assets now employ lawyers , invoke free market nostrums , and claim to follow the letter of the law .
in this respect , the oligarchs and their political placemen who insist that their right to stolen property is sacred make the same crude claim as the regime that we overthrew : that they have an indefeasible right to the exercise of power . they reject the principle that there is a law which is superior to presidents , magnates , majorities , or mobs .
endorsing the claim to arbitrary power is the cardinal heresy of those who say we should certify property stolen from the state as rightfully owned . I call this a heresy because it rejects the supremacy of equality under law and proclaims the supremacy of particular men .
so they imagine the property rights acquired through cronyism , nepotism , and backroom dealing as somehow emerging from a Lockean realm of freedom . when my government questioned this assumption , they cried out that this was interference by the state with legitimate property rights .
some who a year ago displayed great public spirit came to feel , when in government , that they could not vindicate the supremacy of law without curtailing economic growth . because the grind of government can obscure enduring principle , people inspired by the best motives now find themselves on the same side as their criminal adversaries .
without this conviction the letter of the law is nothing but a mask for bureaucratic caprice and authoritarian will . for when people do not believe that their government adheres to this higher spirit of law , no constitution is worth the paper it is written on ; no business transaction is safe .
for maintaining a constitutional order and viable free market requires an intuitive dislike of arbitrariness , a sensitivity to its manifestations , and spontaneous resistance .
this was why my government sought to recover stolen state property . by doing so , and then auctioning that property in a transparent manner , Ukrainians saw that arbitrary action could be redressed , that the rule of law applied to the powerful as well as the weak .
indeed , this did happen with the one property recovery that my government was able to secure , the giant Kryvorizhstal steel works that our former president ’ s son-in-law gained through a rigged sale at a bargain price . on its re-auction , Ukraine received more than five times the amount that had been paid through that insider deal .
the lesson in the open Kryvorizhstal auction is clear : if a president may not act willfully , arbitrarily , by personal prerogative , then no one may . ministers may not .
if , as we were taught by Marx , belief in a higher law is a mixture of sentimentality , superstition , and unconscious rationalizations , then the predations that incited the Orange Revolution are in reality the only possible conditions in which we can live . we must give up the hope of liberty within an ordered society and market and resign ourselves to that interminable war of all against all of which Hobbes spoke .
to escape from want we are told we must embrace illegality . to promote the truth , we are told that old crimes - even the beheading of a journalist and the poisoning of our president - must not be closely examined .
yet these are the choices offered by our influential doctrinaires . but to see these as Ukraine ’ s only options is to mistake weariness for wisdom , and to be discouraged rather than to understand .
Ukraine ’ s Watershed Election
our voters cannot stroll in one direction during one poll , and in the opposite direction the next time they vote , without worrying about falling over the edge . Ukrainians are people of the watershed : we live on either one side or the other of a great divide .
of the three leading electoral coalitions that are challenging each other , the forces that supported the Orange Revolution seek a modern and democratic future for our country . the other bloc offers the near-certainty of a return to a surly and squalid isolation ­ -- perhaps the beginning of the end of our hard-won independence .
of course , our Orange forces are not perfect , and Viktor Yanukovych – who again opposes Ukraine ’ s democrats – is not Stalin reincarnated . but the records of both alternatives suggest that Ukraine under those who backed the Orange Revolution will remain a member of the club of democracies and open economies , whereas under Yanukovich , Ukraine would turn its back on reform , and may re-embrace the grimmest aspects of our Soviet past .
Yanukovych ’ s “ Party of the Regions ” has been leading in opinion polls for months , and the world should remember that Yushchenko ’ s ultimate triumph over him in 2004 was by a whisker , not a landslide . moreover , Yushchenko used his year in power mostly to disappoint those whose votes he now needs .
the case against a Yanukovych counter-revolution is that it would be just that : a ruthless effort to undo Ukraine ’ s democratic and legal reforms . moreover , he would not be left to himself to govern , but would be a marionette of the oligarchs who bankroll his party , and perhaps of Russia , which yearns ­ – albeit more discretely than a year ago – for his triumph .
Yanukovych ’ s party contains the largest core of unreconstructed apparatchiks of any party . many of its candidates seek office not to work for Ukraine ’ s betterment , but to gain parliamentary immunity from prosecution .
some say we should not worry , that democracy and the market are now too well established in Ukraine to be replaced ; that reform is irreversible ; and that the country ’ s ruling oligarchic clans , like those of Eastern Europe , will in time become law-abiding capitalists . alas , this view is based more on wishful-thinking than on reality .
a year after the Orange Revolution demonstrated ordinary Ukrainians ’ fidelity to liberty , Yanukovych still evinces no faith in democracy , and the “ single economic space ” with Russia that he backs will strengthen the abusive oligarchic system and rule out liberalization . Yanukovych ’ s foreign policy might not be openly subservient to Russia , but it won ’ t also be a clearly pro-western one either .
many who support Yanukovych do not necessarily wish to go back to the old days but are confused by the buffeting they have received in the past decade . Yanukovych panders to xenophobes and anti-Semites , and his strongest appeal is to the core of angry diehards who detest the collapse of Soviet power .
I do not claim that the Orange Revolution ’ s protagonists are paragons , and that the split between Yushchenko and me has not disheartened many of those who stood with us in the streets of Kyiv in the winter of 2004-2005 . but no one can question that we brought more honest government , and the beginnings of a more open economy , to Ukraine .
this is why our people should know precisely what they are voting for this Sunday . I have pledged that , under no circumstances will I form a coalition government with Viktor Yanukovych .
criminal and civil codes will be enforced ; our courts will be allowed to find their feet and their freedom . above all , the new Rada ( parliament ) will settle down to the business of enacting laws and monitoring the government , not carving up the budget among corrupt clans .
a Yanukovych restoration would be a disaster for Ukraine , for Russia , and for Europe , because it would put Ukraine ’ s independence in question and tempt Russia with dreams of renewed empire . only a second victory over Yanukovych can secure a future of freedom and hope for Ukraine ’ s people .
Ukraine : the Next Crisis ?
the Russian invasion of Georgia has sent shock waves throughout the West and the former Soviet space - especially Ukraine . indeed , Ukraine could be the next potential crisis .
Georgia &apos;s increasingly pro-Western course , including growing ties to NATO , has been a thorn in Moscow &apos;s side . but it did not pose a serious threat to Russian security .
Ukraine &apos;s integration into NATO , by contrast , would have far-reaching strategic consequences , ending any residual Russian hopes of forming a ampquot ; Slavic Unionampquot ; composed of Russia , Belarus and Ukraine - a dream that still beats in the breast of many Russians . it would also have important implications for the Russian defense industry , notably air defense and missile production .
in short , the real source of Moscow &apos;s anxiety and strategic angst is Ukraine &apos;s future political and security orientation . Georgia has largely been a side show .
Russia has a number of means of pressuring Ukraine short of using military force . one is energy .
Ukraine has been pressing Russia to begin discussions on the fleet &apos;s withdrawal . but Russia has dragged its feet , suggesting that Moscow may seek to use the presence of the fleet as a means of pressuring Ukraine .
Khrushchev transferred the peninsula to Ukraine in 1954 as a gift to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the unification of Ukraine and Russia . at the time , the gesture was largely symbolic , as Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union and few could envisage an independent Ukraine .
separatist pressures emerged in Crimea immediately following the collapse of the Soviet Union . they subsided after 1995 largely because the Russian separatists were divided , and Moscow , facing separatist pressures in Chechnya , showed little inclination to support them .
however , separatist pressures , while diminished , continue to exist in Crimea . given Crimea &apos;s historic ties to Russia and its majority ethnic Russian population , many Ukrainian officials fear that Russia could try to foment separatist movements in Crimea as a means of putting pressure on Ukraine to curb its ties to the West .
Russia encouraged and supported separatist movements in both entities , then used the separatist tensions to justify sending ampquot ; Russian peacekeepersampquot ; into the regions . moreover , it granted Russian citizenship to Abkhaz and South Ossetian residents , and then justified its recent invasion of Georgia on the grounds that it had an obligation to protect Russian citizens .
Western allies have a strong strategic interest in supporting Ukrainian democracy and Ukraine &apos;s Euro-Atlantic integration . but this course must be pursued prudently and with great care .
as the Georgian crisis has underscored , there are limits to the ability to influence developments in a region where Russia has strong strategic interests and a preponderance of military power . thus Europe and the United States need to be very careful about making security commitments they are unwilling or unable to carry out .
this does not mean that Moscow should be given a veto over Ukraine &apos;s security orientation or that Ukraine can never become a member of NATO . the door for Ukraine to join NATO should remain open .
but with Russia in a defiant mood and refusing to fully withdraw its troops from Georgia , now is not the time to accelerate efforts to bring Ukraine into the Alliance . poking an angry bear is not a wise policy .
Ukraine ’ s Vote , Russia ’ s Fate
Stockholm – When Ukraine ’ s voters go to the polls on October 26 , not only the fate of their country will be at stake ; so will the future of a significant part of Europe . to put it simply : the future of Ukraine will decide the future of Russia , and the future of Russia will have a substantial impact on the future of Europe .
when the Soviet Union collapsed more than two decades ago , and Ukraine opted for independence , many expected the country to do better than Russia in the years to come . but events turned out differently .
during the first decade of the new century , Russia benefited from the combined effect of an old hydrocarbon industry that privatization in the 1990s had made more efficient and high oil prices . the reversal of sought-after economic diversification , and the reduction of “ modernization ” to little more than a slogan , caused no immediate concern .
by contrast , Ukraine became the worst managed of all the post-Soviet states , with cronyism and corruption thwarting productive capacity , and causing the country to fall further and further behind other post-communist countries in transition . most notable is the comparison with Poland : at independence , the two countries had roughly the same GDP per capita ; today , Poland ’ s is more than three times higher .
the Orange Revolution in 2004 was a failure for most Ukrainians . the hoped-for break with the past did not occur , as political infighting among the country ’ s new leaders blocked the implementation of any serious reform agenda .
but 2004 was also a bitter failure for Russian President Vladimir Putin , who tried to bring his favored presidential candidate , Viktor Yanukovych , to power in Kyiv by supporting massive vote manipulation . the failure was a bitter blow to the Kremlin , one that was neither forgiven nor forgotten .
then , in 2010 , the Orange Revolution ’ s failure brought Yanukovych to power in a free and fair election , and in 2012 Putin selected himself for a third presidential term in Russia . the creation of a new Eurasia Union was a key part of his platform .
in the meantime , Ukraine had been negotiating with the European Union for a free-trade and association agreement since 2007 , and these talks were completed in early 2012 . though entirely compatible with the existing free-trade agreement between Ukraine and Russia , the proposed pact with the EU certainly was not compatible with Putin ’ s Eurasia project .
a little more than a year ago , the Kremlin began its offensive to turn Ukraine away from an EU agreement that was supported even by Yanukovych and his Party of Regions . the rest – Yanukovych ’ s renunciation of the EU agreement , the popular uprising that ousted him in response , two invasions by Russia , and thousands of people killed in the country ’ s eastern Donbas region – is history .
the Kremlin is seeking more than the annexation of Crimea and control over the Donbas rust belt ; its aim is to prevent Ukraine from going West , force it to turn East , and quash any risk within Russia ’ s wider orbit of further revolutions like the one that brought down Yanukovych .
Western sanctions against Russia have certainly highlighted the seriousness with which the EU and the United States view Putin ’ s efforts to challenge and undermine the core principles of European security and international law . but even a weakened Russia will still be a strong power in its immediate neighborhood .
but to strengthen a Ukraine plagued by corruption and cronyism , and heavily burdened by Russian aggression and destabilization , is no easy task . the election on Sunday must give rise to a government that is truly determined to bring radical reform to the country .
a revised and reinforced International Monetary Fund package is imperative if the necessary reforms are to be enacted . the country ’ s irrational energy policy , based on immensely wasteful subsidies to consumers , must be fundamentally altered .
if this agenda succeeds , the Kremlin ’ s revisionist bid will be blocked ; as this becomes apparent , there might even be an opening for a new and urgently needed wave of reform in Russia itself . but if reform fails , there is little doubt that the Kremlin will continue its policies until it reaches its aims in Kyiv .
then , set on a course of continued confrontation with the West , Russia might hunker down into a siege mentality , with the risk that the Kremlin might seek to compensate for economic failure with further revisionist behavior . anyone familiar with the aggressively nationalist posturing of Russian state-controlled media nowadays knows the danger of this .
the ambitions of such a Russia will not stop at the Dnieper River . revisionism might turn into outright revanchism as the Kremlin seeks to counter-balance internal weakness with demonstrations of external strength .
that is why the emergence of a strong and democratic Ukraine from decades of failure is needed now . the election this Sunday is crucial for Ukraine , but it also holds the key to encouraging the transformation of Russia into a true member of the democratic European family .
encouraging Work
few policies manage to be economically illiterate and heartless all at once . but Britain ’ s Conservative government has achieved just that , by cutting tax credits for low-income workers .
the system , introduced in 2003 by a Labour government , is modeled after the United States ’ Earned Income Tax Credit . both work in practice like a wage subsidy for those with low incomes , cutting poverty – particularly among women with young children – while strengthening incentives to work .
Turkey adopted regionally targeted employment subsidies in 2004-2005 . when I was Chile ’ s finance minister , our center-left government adopted a wage subsidy in 2008 , focused on young workers .
the Tory move in the United Kingdom is based on shortsighted fiscal calculations ( appearing to shave additional pounds from the budget deficit ) and shortsighted political calculations ( displaying “ toughness ” to right-wing voters who believe that the poor are undeserving ) . but the move is also interesting in terms of what it reveals about the coming debate on the role of work ( and of labor-market policies ) in both advanced and emerging economies .
after globalization made it easier to move manufacturing and service jobs from rich to poor countries , growing automation now threatens to move jobs from humans to robots . a recent paper by two Oxford University economists estimates that up to 47 % of all jobs in the US are at risk .
Techno-optimists like venture capitalist Peter Thiel point out that machines consume little ( beyond electricity ) while allowing us to produce vastly more , so their effects on human welfare must be unambiguously positive . Techno-pessimists like Robert Skidelsky fear that machines will wipe out so many jobs that governments will be forced to provide an income to all citizens .
the nineteenth-century Luddites fretted over that . inventions like the steam engine and the power loom destroyed some jobs but eventually created many more .
one is that adjustment is lengthy , because old jobs go quickly but new ones can take a long time to replace them . public policies are needed both to accelerate the process and to alleviate human suffering .
another caveat is that technological change may worsen the income distribution if the jobs that are destroyed are those filled by unskilled workers . less demand for their services will cause their relative ( and perhaps absolute ) wages to drop , causing income inequality to rise .
in rich countries , the stagnation of middle-class wages has caused understandable anxiety . politicians like Hillary Clinton in the United States are promising that they can cajole large corporations into paying higher wages .
politics is heating up in middle-income countries as well , and unions are pressing politicians to take action . consider Chile , where the current leftist government has sent a bill to Congress that promises to improve income distribution simply by giving unions more power in collective bargaining .
limited minimum-wage increases in a growing economy need not cost jobs ; but sizeable increases in a context of slumping growth ( the norm nearly everywhere today ) surely will . and automation will make it easier to substitute machines for workers , likely undermining the low elasticity of labor demand with respect to the cost of hiring ( adjusted to include turnover and training costs ) that underlies the Card-Krueger-Krugman view .
similarly , the potential for union-led bargaining to redistribute income presupposes non-competitive corporate practices , which in turn generate abnormal profits that can be bargained away by unions . but globalization and technological progress , by making it easier to match supply and demand , will make such monopolistic behavior harder to maintain in the future .
are Uber drivers Uber employees ? the debate is raging in cities from Paris to San Francisco , and one can be sure that similar controversies will erupt in many more cities and countries – and not just over Uber .
we are accustomed to the idea that owners of capital hire laborers and set the rules . in the future , technology may enable laborers to hire the capital they need and work with an unprecedented degree of autonomy .
last month , I attended a conference in France entitled “ What if work were the key ? ” The attendees – France ’ s best and brightest – resoundingly concluded that work does seem to be the key to enhancing social cohesion , and to more fulfilling lives .
the attendees also agreed that the best way to improve income distribution is to provide work to those who have no job ( and therefore no income ) . one figure mentioned at the conference stuck out : out of today ’ s five billion working-age people , only three billion have jobs .

what Are We Betting On ?
another , more uncertain assumption underpinning the bet on more inclusive growth is that the eurozone and Japan will be able to escape the mire of low growth and avoid deflation , which , by impelling households and businesses to postpone purchasing decisions , would undermine already weak economic performance . finally , the bet assumes that oil-exporting countries like Nigeria , Venezuela , and especially Russia will fend off economic implosion , even as global oil prices plummet .
these are bold assumptions – not least because achieving these outcomes would require considerable economic reinvention , extending far beyond rebalancing aggregate demand and eliminating pockets of excessive indebtedness . while the US and China are significantly better placed than others , most of these economies – in particular , the struggling eurozone countries , Japan , and some emerging markets – would have to nurture entirely new growth engines .
that adds up to a tough reform agenda – made all the more challenging by adjustment fatigue , increasingly fragmented domestic politics , and rising geopolitical tensions . in this context , a determined shift toward markedly higher and more inclusive global growth is far from guaranteed .
the second component of the collective bet – the avoidance of policy mistakes – is similarly tenuous . the fundamental assumption here is that the untested , unconventional policies adopted by central banks , particularly in advanced countries , to repress financial volatility and maintain economic stability will buy enough time for governments to design and deliver a more suitable and comprehensive policy response .
this experimental approach by central banks has involved the conscious decoupling of financial-asset prices from their fundamentals . the hope has been that more buoyant market valuations would boost consumption ( via the “ wealth effect , ” whereby asset-owning households feel wealthier and thus more inclined to spend ) and investment ( via “ animal spirits , ” which bolster entrepreneurs ’ willingness to invest in new plant , equipment , and hiring ) .
the problem is that the current economic and policy configuration in the developed world entails an unusual amount of “ divergence . ” With policy adjustments failing to keep pace with shifts on the ground , an appreciating dollar has assumed the role of shock absorber .
the final element of the world ’ s collective bet is rooted in the belief that excessive market risk-taking has been tamed . but a protracted period of policy-induced volatility repression has convinced investors that , with central banks on their side , they are safe – a belief that has led to considerable risk-positioning in some segments of finance .
with intermediaries becoming reluctant to take on securities that are undesirable to hold during periods of financial instability , market corrections can compound sudden and dramatic price shifts , disrupting the orderly functioning of financial systems . so far , central banks have been willing and able to ensure that these periods are temporary and reversible .
the fact is that central banks do not have the tools to deliver rapid , sustainable , and inclusive growth on their own . the best they can do is extend the bridge ; it is up to other economic policymakers to provide an anchoring destination .
the nature of financial risks has morphed and migrated in recent years ; problems caused by irresponsible banks and threats to the payment and settlement systems have been supplanted by those caused by risk-taking among non-bank institutions . with the regulatory system failing to evolve accordingly , the potential effectiveness of some macro-prudential policies has been undermined .
none of this is to say that the outlook for markets and the global economy is necessarily dire ; on the contrary , there are notable upside risks that could translate into considerable and durable gains . but understanding the world ’ s collective bet does underscore the need for more responsive and comprehensive policymaking .
uncertainty Shifts to China
the United States ’ trade and current account deficits have begun to shrink relative to American and world GDP . Asian current account surpluses are about to start to shrink as well , especially if growth slows markedly in America in the aftermath of the end of its housing boom .
at the moment , Europe is feeling most of the pain , as the euro ’ s value has risen furthest and fastest against the dollar . but Latin America and Asia will start to feel distress as well , as the decade-long US role as the global economy ’ s importer of last resort comes to an end .
as long as imbalances of world trade and capital flows unwind slowly and smoothly , the magnitude of any global economic distress should be relatively small . of course , it will not seem small to exporters and their workers who lose their American markets , or to Americans who lose access to cheap capital provided by foreigners .
a formal recession , however , is not an overwhelming probability , and is likely to be small . the prospect of a truly hard landing – that global investors wake up one morning , suddenly recognize the US current account ’ s cannot be sustained , dump dollars , and bring about a crash of the global economy – is becoming less likely with each passing day .
under two plausible scenarios – both concerning China – the unwinding of global imbalances could cause regional if not global depression . in the first scenario , China continues to attempt to maintain full employment in Shanghai , Guangzhou , and elsewhere not by stimulating domestic demand but by trying to boost exports further by keeping the renminbi stable against the dollar and falling in value against the euro .
the effort to maintain the dollar-renminbi exchange rate at a level approved by China ’ s State Council has already led to an enormous increase in the Chinese economy ’ s financial liquidity . the consequences of this are now manifested in property and stock market inflation , but not yet in rampant and uncontrolled consumer price inflation – at least for now .
four years ago , I would have said that the principal source of international economic disorder was made in America . that has passed as a result of the dollar ’ s decline and the ebbing political strength of right-wing populist factions in the US that seek ever-greater redistribution to the rich fueled by ever-increasing tax cuts and ever-rising long-term deficits .
today , the principal source of international economic disorder is made in China , owing to factions inside its government that hope to avoid a more-rapid appreciation of the renminbi ’ s value . I cannot judge the strength of these factions , or whether they know that the falling US current account deficit and dollar may lessen the urgency of adjustment in the rest of the world , but not in China .
Richard Nixon ’ s treasury secretary , John Connally , once told a group of European leaders that while the dollar was America ’ s currency , its misalignment was Europe ’ s problem . today , the misalignment of the dollar – and the euro – against the renminbi and other Asian currencies is increasingly becoming Asia ’ s problem .
kereta Cepat Copenhagen-Paris
Copenhagen – Pada tahun 2009 , ketika Copenhagen menjadi tuan rumah Konferensi Perubahan Iklim PBB , saya ikut hadir sebagai anggota parlemen dan saya merasa sedang menyaksikan peristiwa yang mengubah dunia . selama bertahun-tahun , para negosiator mengupayakan penetapan perjanjian yang ambisius dan mengikat untuk membatasi emisi gas rumah kaca dan perhatian dunia tertuju ke Denmark .
tetapi kali ini , besar kemungkinannya kesepakatan yang kuat akan terwujud . saya akan hadir , sebagai menteri Denmark yang bertanggung atas isu-isu iklim , dan saya yakin konferensi tahun ini akan menandai momen ketika negara-negara menunjukkan komitmennya untuk mengendalikan pemanasan global .
situasi politik sekarang sangat berbeda dengan enam tahun lalu . dulu saat konferensi di Copenhagen diselenggarakan , dunia belum pulih dari krisis yang hampir meruntuhkan keuangan global , politisi-politisi terkemuka masih mempertanyakan apakah betul aktivitas manusia bertanggung jawab atas terjadinya perubahan iklim , dan kelompok industri menolak kewajiban penurunan emisi .
kini , ekonomi global telah pulih , para ilmuwan iklim telah menjawab kerugian terakhir tentang penyebab perubahan iklim , dan komunitas bisnis telah berpihak dengan lingkungan hidup . pada tahun 2009 , jumlah pemimpin bisnis hijau ( green business ) sangat sedikit .
akibatnya , tiap negara akan menggerakkan kemajuan kesepakatan ini . mereka sudah menyadari bahwa konsekuensi buruk akan timbul dari tidak adanya tindakan , dan manfaat dari upaya penurunan emisi sekarang akan terbayarkan dalam jangka panjang .
misalnya tahun lalu Amerika Serikat dan Tiongkok menandatangani perjanjian bilateral untuk melawan perubahan iklim . Amerika Serikat setuju akan mengurangi emisi sebesar 26-28 % hingga tahun 2025 dan Tiongkok berkomitmen akan menetapkan emisi puncaknya sekitar tahun 2030 dan lalu menurunkan jumlah emisi .
perjanjian di Paris diharapkan akan melibatkan lebih dari 180 negara dan mencakup setidaknya 90 % emisi CO2 global . sebagai perbandingan , Protokol Kyoto tahun 1997 mencakup kurang dari 15 % emisi global .
selama 25 tahun ke depan , kebutuhan energi global akan meningkat hampir sepertiga , terutama di negara-negara non-OECD seperti Tiongkok dan India , dan kita harus memastikan pemenuhan energi ini dilakukan dengan cara-cara yang berkelanjutan . organisasi seperti International Energy Agency ( Badan Energi Internasional ) bisa lebih banyak berperan dalam membantu mendorong transisi menuju energi bersih .
komunitas internasional nampaknya akan berhasil mencapai tujuan yang disepakati sebelumnya di Copenhagen untuk mengucurkan dana $ 100 miliar per tahun sebagai pendanaan iklim untuk negara-negara berkembang mulai tahun 2020 . supaya terwujud , kita perlu memanfaatkan kekuatan marketplace , meningkatkan daya tarik dana publik agar mendorong investasi swasta .
upaya ini juga memerlukan penghapusan subsidi bahan bakar fosil secara bertahap , serta pengembangan instrumen keuangan baru untuk mendorong para investor memecahkan masalah secara mandiri , tanpa bergantung pada dana publik .
kesepakatan di Paris akan menghasilkan kerangka kerja global yang sangat dibutuhkan semua negara dalam mengurangi total emisi gas rumah kaca .

an Unconventional Truth
in January , it fully adopted QE . indeed , by now the Fed , the Bank of England , the Bank of Japan , the ECB , and a variety of smaller advanced economies ’ central banks , such as the Swiss National Bank , have all relied on such unconventional policies .
one result of this global monetary-policy activism has been a rebellion among pseudo-economists and market hacks in recent years . this assortment of “ Austrian ” economists , radical monetarists , gold bugs , and Bitcoin fanatics has repeatedly warned that such a massive increase in global liquidity would lead to hyperinflation , the US dollar ’ s collapse , sky-high gold prices , and the eventual demise of fiat currencies at the hands of digital krypto-currency counterparts .
inflation is low and falling in almost all advanced economies ; indeed , all advanced-economy central banks are failing to achieve their mandate – explicit or implicit – of 2 % inflation , and some are struggling to avoid deflation . moreover , the value of the dollar has been soaring against the yen , euro , and most emerging-market currencies .
to be sure , most of the doomsayers have barely any knowledge of basic economics . but that has not stopped their views from informing the public debate .
the reason why central banks have increasingly embraced unconventional monetary policies is that the post-2008 recovery has been extremely anemic . such policies have been needed to counter the deflationary pressures caused by the need for painful deleveraging in the wake of large buildups of public and private debt .
moreover , there is still slack in real-estate markets where booms went bust ( the United States , the United Kingdom , Spain , Ireland , Iceland , and Dubai ) . and bubbles in other markets ( for example , China , Hong Kong , Singapore , Canada , Switzerland , France , Sweden , Norway , Australia , New Zealand ) pose a new risk , as their collapse would drag down home prices .
commodity markets , too , have become a source of disinflationary pressure . North America ’ s shale-energy revolution has weakened oil and gas prices , while China ’ s slowdown has undermined demand for a broad range of commodities , including iron ore , copper , and other industrial metals , all of which are in greater supply after years of high prices stimulated investments in new capacity .
China ’ s slowdown , coming after years of over-investment in real estate and infrastructure , is also causing a global glut of manufactured and industrial goods . with domestic demand in these sectors now contracting sharply , the excess capacity in China ’ s steel and cement sectors – to cite just two examples – is fueling further deflationary pressure in global industrial markets .
rising income inequality , by redistributing income from those who spend more to those who save more , has exacerbated the demand shortfall . so has the asymmetric adjustment between over-saving creditor economies that face no market pressure to spend more , and over-spending debtor economies that do face market pressure and have been forced to save more .
simply put , we live in a world in which there is too much supply and too little demand . the result is persistent disinflationary , if not deflationary , pressure , despite aggressive monetary easing .
the inability of unconventional monetary policies to prevent outright deflation partly reflects the fact that such policies seek to weaken the currency , thereby improving net exports and increasing inflation . this , however , is a zero-sum game that merely exports deflation and recession to other economies .
to be effective , monetary stimulus needs to be accompanied by temporary fiscal stimulus , which is now lacking in all major economies . indeed , the eurozone , the UK , the US , and Japan are all pursuing varying degrees of fiscal austerity and consolidation .
with long-term interest rates close to zero in most advanced economies ( and in some cases even negative ) , the case for infrastructure spending is indeed compelling . but a variety of political constraints – particularly the fact that fiscally strapped economies slash capital spending before cutting public-sector wages , subsidies , and other current spending – are holding back the needed infrastructure boom .
all of this adds up to a recipe for continued slow growth , secular stagnation , disinflation , and even deflation . that is why , in the absence of appropriate fiscal policies to address insufficient aggregate demand , unconventional monetary policies will remain a central feature of the macroeconomic landscape .
resurrecting Glass-Steagall
all three of the remaining mainstream Democratic presidential candidates now agree that the existing state of the financial sector is not satisfactory and that more change is needed . President Barack Obama has long regarded the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation as bringing about sufficient change .
the three leading Democratic candidates disagree , however , on whether there should be legislation to re-erect a wall between the rather dull business of ordinary commercial banking and other kinds of finance ( such as issuing and trading securities , commonly known as investment banking ) .
this issue is sometimes referred to as “ reinstating Glass-Steagall , ” a reference to the Depression-era legislation – the Banking Act of 1933 – that separated commercial and investment banking . this is a slight misnomer : the most credible bipartisan proposal on the table takes a much-modernized approach to distinguishing and making more transparent different kinds of finance activities .
there are three main arguments against a modern version of Glass-Steagall . none is convincing .
first , some prominent former officials argue that not all of the financial firms that got into trouble in 2008 were integrated commercial-investment banking operations . for example , Lehman Brothers was a standalone investment bank , and AIG was an insurance company .
what happened “ last time ” is rarely a good guide to fighting wars or anticipating future financial crises . the world moves on , in terms of technology and risks .
some of the greatest threats in 2008 were posed by banks – such as Citigroup – built on the premise that integrating commercial and investment banking would bring stability and better service . Sandy Weill , the primary architect of the modern Citigroup , regrets that construction – and regrets lobbying for the repeal of Glass-Steagall .
second , leading representatives of big banks argue that much has changed since 2008 – and that big banks have become significantly safer . unfortunately , this is a great exaggeration .
ensuring a financial system ’ s stability is a multifaceted endeavor – complex enough to keep many diligent people fully employed . but it also comes down to this : how much loss-absorbing shareholder equity is on the balance sheets of the largest financial firms ?
this was not enough to withstand the storm . ( here I ’ m using tangible equity relative to tangible assets , as recommended by Tom Hoenig , Vice Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , and a beacon of clarity on these issues . )
now , under the most generous possible calculation , the surviving megabanks have on average about 5 % equity relative to total assets – that is , they are 95 % financed with debt . is this the major and profound change that will prove sufficient as we head through the credit cycle ?
finally , some observers – although relatively few at this point – argue that the biggest banks have greatly improved their control and compliance systems , and that the mismanagement of risk on a systemically significant scale is no longer possible .
this view is simply implausible . consider all the instances of money laundering and sanctions busting ( with evidence against Credit Agricole last week , Deutsche Bank this week , and almost every major international bank in the past few years ) .
if the US had the equivalent of the National Transportation Safety Board for finance , we would receive detailed public reports on what exactly is – still , after all these years – going wrong . sadly , what we actually get is plea bargains in which all relevant details are kept secret .
and , to reinforce this , we should want to make the largest banks simpler and more transparent , with “ strong structural firewalls ” as Dennis Kelleher , of Better Markets , puts it . of course , in that context , we should ensure that various activities by “ shadow banks ” ( structures that operate with bank-like features , as Lehman Brothers did ) are properly regulated .
building support for legislation to simplify the biggest banks would greatly strengthen the hand of those regulators who want to require more shareholder equity and better regulation for the shadows . these policies are complements , not substitutes .
conflict Management and Economic Growth
new DELHI – One of the most interesting aspects of the prolonged economic crisis in Europe , and of the even longer crisis in Japan , is the absence of serious social conflict – at least thus far . yes , there have been strikes , marches , and growing anger at political leaders , but protests have been largely peaceful .
while that may change , the credit for social peace must go to institutions such as elections ( “ throwing the rascals out ” is a non-violent way to vent popular anger ) , responsive democratic legislatures , and effective judiciaries . all of these institutions have successfully mediated political conflict during a time of great adversity in advanced countries .
this suggests that a major reason for underdevelopment may be that such institutions , which allow countries to cope with distress , are missing in poor economies . economic growth permits conflict between social actors to be papered over .
for example , squabbling between workers and management may drive away investors – and thus the chance to start new projects . but if there are no new investment opportunities on the horizon , squabbling is less costly , because the existing plant and machinery are already sunk costs .
regardless of why conflicts are greater in times of economic adversity , how a society deals with them depends on the scope and quality of its conflict-management institutions . the Oxford University economist Paul Collier has shown that years of weak economic growth typically precede civil war in poor countries .
not surprisingly , these states typically have weak conflict-management institutions – patchy law enforcement , limited adherence to democratic principles , and few meaningful checks and balances on the government . similarly , Dani Rodrik of Harvard University has found that the countries that experienced the sharpest declines in growth after 1975 had divided societies and weak conflict-management institutions .
for example , people who suffer the most adversity can fall back on an explicit social safety net – a minimum level of unemployment insurance , for example . in the United States in recent years , federal and state legislatures prolonged unemployment benefits as joblessness persisted .
similarly , debtors and creditors can rely on credible bankruptcy proceedings to determine their relative shares . with an explicit institutional mechanism in place to dictate the division of pain , there is no need to take to the streets .
by contrast , when institutions are too weak to offer predictable and acceptable settlements , or to protect existing shares , everyone has an incentive to jockey for a larger slice of the pie . outcomes will be mediated more by actors ’ relative bargaining power than by pre-existing implicit or explicit contracts .
can countries without a reliable and effective legislature or legal system do better to protect against downturns ?
for example , labor contracts in many developing countries effectively prohibit employers from firing workers . this is regarded as inefficient because firms cannot adjust quickly to changing business conditions .
often , such prohibitions are attributed to overly strong unions that hold the economy hostage . but , if slow or corrupt courts mean that a worker who is wrongfully dismissed has no legal recourse , perhaps the prohibition on firing – enforced by mass protests against violations , which are easily and publicly observable – is the only way to protect workers from arbitrary decisions by employers .
job tenure may also serve as a form of social security , because the government performs miserably on providing a safety net and private insurance markets do not exist . thus , an inflexible contract can protect workers when the preponderance of bargaining power is with firms .
Alternatively , knowing that they cannot fire permanent workers , firms may remain tiny in order to remain below the authorities ’ radar . or they may hire informal workers who have no rights , or pay inspectors to look the other way ( a related point could be made about workplace safety in Bangladesh ’ s garment factories ) .
thus , the attempt to protect workers with rigid labor laws may have the unintended consequence of generating too few protected jobs . this may be the situation in India , where most workers have few rights , and the few large firms that are established in the formal sector tend to use a lot of labor-saving capital in order to avoid hiring protected workers .
moreover , removing rigid protections without offering alternative , contingent safety nets and judicial redress is a recipe for conflict . at the same time , some protection is better than none , and if most workers are unprotected , change becomes necessary to avoid even worse conflict .
sustainable change in developing countries requires reforming not only specific arrangements , such as rigid labor laws , but also more basic institutions , such as the legislature and the judiciary , to make them more responsive to people ’ s needs . if developed countries ’ citizens want to feel slightly better about their economies ’ slow growth and high unemployment , they should contemplate how much worse matters could be without the institutions that they have .
the view expressed here are the author ’ s own .
how to Move China
Denver – “ Insanity , ” Albert Einstein is reported to have said , is “ doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . ” For those who have long scoffed at the possibility that China might be willing to deal decisively with its pesky North Korean neighbor , the results of US Secretary of State John Kerry ’ s recent visit to Beijing will be all too predictable .
but , for those who watch China ’ s ever-changing internal political landscape carefully , there is much happening that more than justifies Kerry ’ s trip . indeed , if US President Barack Obama ’ s administration is to be criticized for its handling of the latest North Korean “ crisis , ” the main problem has not been too much reliance on China , but too little .
indeed , for all the characterization of China as a despotic state that one hears from the political right in the United States , its president enjoys fewer powers than his American counterpart . gaining consensus in China is a glacial process that will not be accomplished in a single speech .
North Korea is , strangely , a domestic issue for China . for starters , it is a historic ally for which many Chinese fought and died , their memory enshrined not only on monuments throughout China ( though precious few in North Korea ) , but also in families .
finally , there are those who would view a North Korean collapse as a boon to US strategic interests and a setback for Chinese interests . such hardline , zero-sum thinking is not the exclusive preserve of American think tanks .
could they expect to see US troops and bases along the Chinese border on the Yalu River , or perhaps a string of listening posts to gather intelligence ? though such deployments would be inconceivable to most thinking Americans ( indeed , the real task would be to maintain budget support in Congress and elsewhere for any deployments in a united Korea ) , Chinese security experts worry about it .
the Chinese have never been eager to discuss with their US counterparts what the two countries should do in the event of a North Korean implosion . but , if such talks were held more frequently , and the issue were addressed seriously ( and repeatedly ) , surely progress could be made in overcoming suspicion on this question .
Kerry ’ s first trip to China was a start in this direction , but it must be followed by a regular pattern of telephone calls and additional visits , with a view to ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons .
heeding History in East Asia
Seoul – Chinese , South Korean , and Japanese diplomats recently took to the podium of the United Nations General Assembly to reassert their countries ’ positions on the territorial issues surrounding several small islands in the seas of East Asia . but the composed manner in which they delivered their remarks belied their countries ’ long-simmering tensions over the islands , which have come to a near boil in the last few months .
soon after , hundreds of Chinese fishing vessels approached the islands to assert China ’ s sovereignty . these vessels have lately been joined by an increasing number of Chinese surveillance forces , which periodically enter the waters surrounding the islands , sometimes leading to direct confrontation with Japanese patrol ships .
with the situation threatening to escalate further , both sides need to contain the conflict quickly and restore the status quo . indeed , the situation is all the more volatile in view of the political transition now underway in China .
meanwhile , the Republic of Korea and Japan are engaged in a territorial standoff over the islets of Dokdo ( called Takeshima in Japanese ) . in early August , Lee Myung-bak became the first South Korean president to visit the islets ;
but the ICJ cannot exercise jurisdiction in the dispute without both countries ’ consent , and South Korea has rejected Japan ’ s proposal , maintaining that Lee was within his authority to visit the islets , given that Dokdo is unquestionably South Korean territory . indeed , South Korea ’ s government denies that there is any dispute over the islands .
like the rest of Korea , Dokdo was annexed by Japan in the early twentieth century , and restored to Korean control after World War II , when Korea regained its independence . thus , while outsiders might view the desolate islands as insignificant , for Koreans , Japan ’ s position on Dokdo is tantamount to a challenge to their country ’ s independence and a denial of its right to exercise sovereignty over its own territory .
in 2005 , the creation of a so-called “ Takeshima Day ” by a local government in Japan triggered a public uproar in South Korea . but Japan has not shied away from the issue , with prominent political figures joining Takeshima Day celebrations each year .
furthermore , Japan ’ s habit of distorting facts in its history books – for example , denying that its former colonial subjects were forced into sexual slavery – has fueled distrust and anger in South Korea and elsewhere in East Asia , including China .
Dokdo is situated midway between the Korean peninsula and Japan ’ s main island , roughly 115 nautical miles from each . but the islets are much closer to the nearest Korean island , Ulleungdo , than to Japan ’ s Okishima .
a survey of historical documents shows a distinct shift in Japan ’ s position on Dokdo . for example , in the late seventeenth century , when conflict between Korea and Japan erupted over the passage of Japanese fishermen to Ulleungdo , Tottori-han ( one of Japan ’ s feudal clans ) told Japan ’ s central government that Ulleungdo and Dokdo did not fall within Japanese territory .
likewise , a report in 1870 by Japan ’ s Ministry of Foreign Affairs , “ A Confidential Inquiry into the Particulars of Korea ’ s Foreign Relations , ” shows that the ministry recognized Dokdo as Korean territory . indeed , the report includes the subject title “ How Takeshima and Matsushima Came to Belong to Joseon ” ( later renamed Korea ) .
moreover , the Dajokan , Japan ’ s highest decision-making body in 1868-1885 , denied any claims of sovereignty over Dokdo through its Order of 1877 . yet , in 1905 , Japan took measures to incorporate Dokdo in order to use it as a strategic military site for its war with Russia .
but earlier versions identified the islets as Korean territory . the reference in the final version , drafted by the United States , was removed in light of US interests in building strategic partnerships with both South Korea and Japan .
however , the 1943 Cairo Declaration , which stipulated the Allied Powers ’ basic position on Japan ’ s territorial boundaries after WWII , stated that Japan would be expelled from all territories that it had annexed through violence . in this context , the unconditional return of Dokdo to Korea – and Korea ’ s continued sovereignty over Dokdo – is indisputable .
in an increasingly interconnected world , significant challenges can be addressed only through regional and global partnerships . but , in order to build a meaningful framework for cooperation , enduring distrust among East Asian countries must be dispelled .
understanding the Frankenstein Tradition
so said Dr. Victor Frankenstein when his “ creation ” was complete . researchers have long been fascinated with trying to create life , but mainly they have had to settle for crafting variations of living organisms via mutation or other techniques of genetic engineering.amp # 160 ;
in May , researchers at the J. Craig Venter Institute , led by Venter himself , synthesized the genome of a bacterium from scratch using chemical building blocks , and inserted it into the cell of a different variety of bacteria . the new genetic information “ rebooted ” its host cell and got it to function , replicate , and take on the characteristics of the “ donor . ”
reactions in the scientific community ranged from “ slight novelty ” to “ looming apocalypse . ” The former is more apt : Venter ’ s creation is evolutionary , not revolutionary .
the goal of “ synthetic biology , ” as the field is known , is to move microbiology and cell biology closer to the approach of engineering , so that standardized parts can be mixed , matched , and assembled – just as off-the-shelf chassis , engines , transmissions , and so on can be combined to build a hot-rod .
achieving this goal could offer scientists unprecedented opportunities for innovation , and better enable them to craft bespoke microorganisms and plants that produce pharmaceuticals , clean up toxic wastes , and obtain ( or “ fix ” ) nitrogen from the air ( obviating the need for chemical fertilizers ) .
the Venter lab ’ s achievement builds on similar work that began decades ago.amp # 160 ; In 1967 , a research group from Stanford Medical School and Caltech demonstrated the infectiousness of the genome of a bacterial virus called ΦΧ174 , whose DNA had been synthesized with an enzyme using the intact viral DNA as a template , or blueprint .
in 2002 , a research group at the State University of New York , Stony Brook , created a functional , infectious poliovirus solely from basic , off-the-shelf chemical building blocks.amp # 160 ; Their only blueprint for engineering the genome was the known sequence of RNA ( which comprises the viral genome and is chemically very similar to DNA ) . similar to the 1967 experiments , the infectious RNA was synthesized enzymatically .
Venter ’ s group did much the same thing in the recently reported research , except that they used chemical synthesis instead of enzymes to make the DNA . but some of the hype that surrounded the publication of the ensuing article in the journal Nature was disproportionate.amp # 160 ;
along with the Venter paper , Nature published eight commentaries on the significance of the work . the “ real ” scientists were aware of the incremental nature of the work , and questioned whether the Venter group had created a genuine “ synthetic cell , ” while the social scientists tended to exaggerate the implications of the work .
mark Bedau , a professor of philosophy at Reed College , wrote that the technology ’ s “ new powers create new responsibilities . nobody can be sure about the consequences of making new forms of life , and we must expect the unexpected and the unintended .
but , with increasing sophistication , genetic engineers using old and new techniques have been creating organisms with novel or enhanced properties for decades . regulations and standards of good practice already effectively address organisms that may be pathogenic or that threaten the natural environment .
on the other hand , Swiss bioengineer Martin Fussenegger correctly observed that the Venter achievement “ is a technical advance , not a conceptual one . ” Other scientists noted that the organism is really only “ semi-synthetic , ” because the synthetic DNA ( which comprises only about 1 % of the dry weight of the cell ) was introduced into a normal , or non-synthetic , bacterium .
understanding the history of synthetic biology is important , because recognizing the correct paradigm has critical implications for how governments regulate it , which in turn affects the potential application and diffusion of the technology . Thirty-five years ago , the US National Institutes of Health adopted overly risk-averse guidelines for research using recombinant DNA , or “ genetic engineering , ” techniques .
synthetic biology offers the prospect of powerful new tools for research and development in innumerable fields . but its potential can be fulfilled only if regulatory oversight is based on science , sound risk analysis , and an appreciation of the mistakes of history .
the Debt-Growth Controversy
the Reinhart / Rogoff paper is just a small part of a voluminous academic literature that shows high debt levels to be economically risky . a more fundamental question is causality : the state of the economy certainly affects the fiscal position , just as taxation , spending , deficits , and debts may affect economic growth .
research errors in economics are not uncommon , but they are usually caught at an early stage , as happened once to me in a prepublication draft . sometimes errors are not discovered until later , when they are working papers , as with Reinhart and Rogoff , or after publication , as with Nobel laureate Ken Arrow , who had to correct a mistake in the proof of his famous impossibility theorem .
each of these approaches has its strengths and weaknesses , and serious economists and policymakers do not rely on a single study ; rather , they base their judgments on complementary bodies of evidence .
thus , there is no excuse for the outrage , the exaggerated claims for one paper ’ s influence , and the attempt to use the error to discredit legitimate concerns over high levels of debt ( let alone to vilify the authors ) .
in normal times , deficits crowd out private investment ( and perhaps crowd in private saving and / or foreign capital ) , and hence reduce future growth . by contrast , in a deep , long-lasting recession , with the central bank ’ s policy rate at the zero lower bound ( ZLB ) , a well-timed , sensible fiscal response can , in principle , be helpful .
but the political process may generate poorly timed or ineffective responses – focused on transfers rather than purchases , infra-marginal tax rebates , and spending that fails cost-benefit tests – that do little good in the short run and cause substantial harm later . America ’ s 2008 stimulus barely budged consumption upward , and the 2009 fiscal stimulus cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per job – many times higher than median pay .
we should adopt policies that benefit the economy in the short run at reasonable long-run cost , and reject those that do not . that sounds simple , but it is a much higher hurdle than politicians in Europe and the US have set for themselves in recent years .
the effect is greater when modest deficit and debt levels are exceeded and current-account deficits are large . the increased interest rates are likely to retard private investment , which lowers future growth in employment and wages .
numerous studies show that government spending “ multipliers , ” even when large at the ZLB , shrink rapidly , then turn negative – and may even be negative during economic expansions and when households expect higher taxes beyond the ZLB period .
some argue that fiscal consolidation by gradual permanent reductions in spending would be expansionary for high-debt countries , as occurred in some historical episodes . others maintain that a temporary increase in spending now would boost growth .
nonetheless , the evidence clearly suggests that high debt / GDP ratios eventually impede long-term growth ; fiscal consolidation should be phased in gradually as economies recover ; and the consolidation needs to be primarily on the spending side of the budget . finally , the notion that we can wait 10-15 years to start dealing with deficits and debt , as economist Paul Krugman has suggested , is beyond irresponsible .
the UN at 70
though there will be plenty of fanfare , it will inadequately reflect the UN ’ s value , not only as the most important political innovation of the twentieth century , but also as the best bargain on the planet . but if the UN is to continue to fulfill its unique and vital global role in the twenty-first century , it must be upgraded in three key ways .
fortunately , there is plenty to motivate world leaders to do what it takes . indeed , the UN has had two major recent triumphs , with two more on the way before the end of this year .
the second big triumph is the successful conclusion , after 15 years , of the Millennium Development Goals , which have underpinned the largest , longest , and most effective global poverty-reduction effort ever undertaken . two UN Secretaries-General have overseen the MDGs : Kofi Annan , who introduced them in 2000 , and Ban Ki-moon , who , since succeeding Annan at the start of 2007 , has led vigorously and effectively to achieve them .
the MDGs have engendered impressive progress in poverty reduction , public health , school enrollment , gender equality in education , and other areas . since 1990 ( the reference date for the targets ) , the global rate of extreme poverty has been reduced by well over half – more than fulfilling the agenda ’ s number one goal .
the precise value of the peace , poverty reduction , and environmental cooperation made possible by the UN is incalculable . if we were to put it in monetary terms , however , we might estimate their value at trillions of dollars per year – at least a few percent of the world economy ’ s annual GDP of $ 100 trillion .
that is not just a bargain ; it is a significant underinvestment . given the rapidly growing need for global cooperation , the UN simply cannot get by on its current budget .
this brings us to the second major area of reform : ensuring that the UN is fit for the new age of sustainable development . specifically , the UN needs to strengthen its expertise in areas such as ocean health , renewable energy systems , urban design , disease control , technological innovation , public-private partnerships , and peaceful cultural cooperation .
the third major reform imperative is the UN ’ s governance , starting with the Security Council , the composition of which no longer reflects global geopolitical realities . indeed , the Western Europe and Other Group ( WEOG ) now accounts for three of the five permanent members ( France , the United Kingdom , and the US ) .
even with two of the ten rotating Security Council seats , the Asia-Pacific region is still massively under-represented . the Asia-Pacific region accounts for roughly 55 % of the world ’ s population and 44 % of its annual income but has just 20 % ( three out of 15 ) of the seats on the Security Council .
as the UN enters its eighth decade , it continues to inspire humanity . the Universal Declaration of Human Rights remains the world ’ s moral charter , and the SDGs promise to provide new guideposts for global development cooperation .
the Children ’ s Revolution
these children have joined the ranks of 25 million displaced boys and girls worldwide – a number equivalent to the population of a midsize European country and the largest in the 70 years since the end of World War II . images of vulnerable , desolate refugee children – likely to be displaced for a decade or more – have become so common that the world seems unable to comprehend what it is seeing .
some 14 million boys and girls below the age of 14 are child laborers , many forced to work in the most hazardous of conditions . and 32 million girls are denied the basic right to attend school , owing to gender discrimination ; around 500,000 of them are trafficked each year .
in the 1960s , 1970s , and 1980s , great civil-rights battles were waged against racial discrimination and apartheid , followed by struggles to advance the rights of the disabled and sexual minorities . it is our generation ’ s task to tackle the civil-rights movement ’ s unfinished business , by ending the exploitation of children , especially girls , and ensuring compulsory universal education .
indeed , though no human-rights treaty has been more widely ratified than the CRC , which requires governments to report on their compliance once every five years , its work lacks adequate resources and enforcement . only one in seven countries submit compliance reports on time , and one-third do not submit even a year late .
another promising initiative – the “ optional protocol on communications , ” aimed at enabling children and their advocates , for the first time , to bring cases before the UN Human Rights Committee – has been similarly weakened by a lack of strong support , authority , and resources . indeed , only 14 countries have ratified the protocol since it was agreed in 2011 .
moreover , states are not legally bound to change the policies or laws that are deemed to be violating their international human-rights obligations . and a shortage of investigative resources has led to an emphasis on problematic legislation , instead of the larger issue of inadequate enforcement of laws that promote the CRC ’ s principles .
over time , a reporting system could be implemented to facilitate an examination of the impact of health and education policies on the world ’ s most marginalized boys and girls . such research could provide compelling evidence to support compulsory universal education as the ideal mechanism not just for ending educational exclusion , but also for bringing an end to child labor and trafficking , early marriage , and discrimination against girls .
another advance could follow , based on Graça Machel ’ s victory a decade ago in convincing the UN Security Council to implement a system for reporting violence against children in conflict zones . at the time , it was agreed that a Special Representative on Children and Armed Conflict , whose work is backed by the threat of sanctions , would also be established .
now , the Global March Against Child Labor and A World at School have come together to support the # UpForSchool petition , which links the universal provision of education to ending child exploitation . over the next several months , youth groups in 190 countries will be collecting , it is hoped , a record number of signatures .
but we must do more than read and sign the petition . we must recognize that today ’ s movement to ensure children ’ s rights is the civil-rights struggle of our generation – and do whatever it takes to support it .
Obama ’ s Cuban Breakthrough
Madrid – Too frequently , leaders become hostages , rather than shapers , of their sociopolitical environment . too seldom does the world see history-changing steps like Richard Nixon ’ s trip to China in 1972 or Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat ’ s visit to Jerusalem in 1977 .
for more than a half-century , no US president was willing to pay the political price for admitting failure and resuming diplomatic relations with the island . but , as his tenure enters the home stretch , Barack Obama seems to have been released from such constraints .
a US president can challenge political constraints only by taking on powerful lobbies . President Jimmy Carter ’ s success in mediating the Israeli-Egyptian peace settlement , and his bold call for a “ Palestinian homeland ” ( making him the first US president to do so ) , had much to do with him being deaf to Jewish voices and organizations .
but , with the end of his presidency in view , he finally seems to recognize that securing his legacy requires overcoming not just interest groups , but the structure of interest-group politics in America . he is now at loggerheads with the Republican congressional majority over his landmark climate-change agreement with China and his controversial amnesty plan for illegal immigrants .
likewise , if Obama still hopes to be remembered as the redeemer of the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , he will have to take on the American Israel Public Affairs Committee next . this would represent a departure from early in his presidency , when , in his bid to broker a settlement , he failed to confront AIPAC .
conspicuously , Latin America ’ s last Marxist insurgent group , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia ( FARC ) , declared a unilateral cease-fire just hours after the announcement that the US and Cuba would restore diplomatic ties . over the last two years , Cuba has hosted peace negotiations between FARC and the Colombian government , with full US support .
to be sure , though America ’ s policy toward Cuba has been one of the Cold War ’ s last vestiges , Obama ’ s move will not be a game changer in America ’ s competition with China and Russia to shape the new world order . but it certainly boosts Obama ’ s international credibility and improves his prospects of deterring other global rivals .
Cuba also offers an opportunity to expand the reach of Western liberal values . by maintaining Cold War-era financial subsidies to Cuba , Russia has tried to ensure that the island remained a geopolitical flashpoint , as it was for the Soviet Union .
normalization of relations with the US is key to liberalization in Cuba . after all , such changes are best served not by imposing stifling sanctions , or through military “ shock and awe ” tactics , as in Iraq , but by socioeconomic improvement and diplomatic engagement by external powers .
indeed , predictions that Cuba might now shift toward a Chinese-style model of political autocracy and economic opening might be accurate only in the short term . in the longer term , the end of the Castro era , together with improved relations with the US , is likely to bring about a repeat of Spain ’ s transition toward full-fledged liberal democracy after the fall of Francisco Franco .
it is not too late for him to address other longstanding tensions , such as with Iran and North Korea – not to mention the festering conflict between Israel and Palestine – with similar boldness . and , of course , he should work to mitigate the risk that Russia creates a permanent zone of military tension along its borders with NATO .
ultimately , world peace is in the hands of leaders . history honors those who dare to challenge the politics of inertia by opening , through inspired diplomacy , new paths to progress .
uniting Asia
the Six-Party Talks have , at long last , succeeded – thanks , apparently , to China ’ s solid opposition to the nuclearization of northeast Asia . under the aegis of the Six-Party umbrella , the United States and North Korea have even held the bilateral talks that North Korea ’ s Kim Jong Il has long coveted .
so , for now , northeast Asia is temporarily calmer and less unstable than it has been for almost two decades . yet it remains a potential flashpoint .
in November 2005 , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) accused the South Korean government of having enriched a tiny amount of uranium – to a level close to what could be used in an atomic weapon . the government denied this , claiming that the experiments were conducted without its knowledge by academic researchers “ for scientific interest . ”
a sweeping defense review that Japan recently carried out reaffirms that it will continue to oppose its immediate neighbors ’ possession of nuclear arms . of course , Japan itself already possesses both nuclear technology and solid-fuel missiles .
of course , the creators of today ’ s united Europe did not start by calling for national sovereignty to be abrogated . indeed , Robert Schuman once declared that “ Europe will not be built in a day , nor as part of an overall design .
accordingly , what became the European Union started inconspicuously , with the integration of French and German industries that had been most directly associated with war production – coal and steel . only after economic integration had progressed did the first serious efforts at political integration take place .
in today ’ s East Asia , too , the market is fostering integration . now that the 10 southeast Asian states have been gathered into ASEAN – and are promulgating an ASEAN Charter – the concept of an East Asian Economic Grouping ( EAEG ) that would incorporate ASEAN and China , Japan , and ( a presumably unified and nuclear-free ) Korea is moving forward steadily .
the initial phase of this grand ambition , a free-trade area ( FTA ) between ASEAN and China , began in 2004 and should be completed by 2010 . concurrently , an FTA comprising ASEAN , Japan , and also with South Korea is being negotiated .
North and South Korea must begin the work of reconciliation and community-building on their own initiative , as France and Germany did in 1952 . economics must once again outflank politics , with trade , investment , tourism , and technology transfer intensifying across the 38th Parallel .
as regional neighbors and partners , we should exploit the convergence of interests that the US , Japan , China , India , Russia , ASEAN , Canada , a unified , nuclear weapon-free Korea , Pakistan , Australia-New Zealand , and others share – just as Western European exploited the Cold War stalemate between the US and the Soviet Union to consolidate and expand the EU .
but trans-Pacific peace must be based on a balance not of power but of mutual benefit . clearly , this will involve burden-sharing by all nations in the Asia-Pacific region , and a cooperative understanding among the most affluent and powerful countries in our part of the world – the US , Japan , China , and South Korea .
uniting Europe ’ s Fleets
Paris – Of Europe ’ s 23 naval forces , only France ’ s possesses a fully operational aircraft carrier , the 40,000-ton flagship Charles de Gaulle . although the United Kingdom is currently building two carriers of its own , the Royal Navy is years away from the capability to deliver instant airpower from the sea .
first , sea-borne trade routes , which account for nearly 85 % of the European Union ’ s total exports and imports , must be kept free and safe . and , second , European countries must maintain the capacity to deal with any major security crisis .
for example , rising tensions with Iran could compel Europe to deploy its navies to form a blockade around the Persian Gulf , in order to ensure the transit of oil . similarly , piracy in the Gulf of Guinea and the Indian Ocean , particularly along the coast of Somalia , threatens Europe ’ s maritime activities , including its extensive sea-borne commerce .
indeed , growing concerns over piracy led to the launch in 2008 of the EU ’ s first naval response within the framework of the Common Security and Defense Policy ( CSDP ) – Operation Atalanta . the operation , held annually and comprising 5-10 combat vessels , 1-2 auxiliary ships , and 2-4 maritime-patrol aircraft , includes forces from 26 European navies , and has undoubtedly helped to discourage , if not end , pirate attacks .
Atalanta ’ s success , combined with European naval forces ’ leading role in last year ’ s operations in Libya , shows that Europe possesses much of the naval infrastructure that it needs to ensure its maritime security .
but the Libyan crisis also revealed that Europe ’ s naval security is limited and easily overstretched . more than half of French naval forces were deployed during the Libyan crisis , during which their normal activity rate increased by 10-40 % – at a cost of € 40 million ( $ 50 million ) , not to mention disruptions of standard training and maintenance .
naval assets are not only expensive to build ; they are extremely costly to operate , as each unit requires specialized equipment and highly trained personnel . as a result , navies are often among the first to be targeted by cuts in defense budgets .
and yet , while naval deployments do not always end conflicts , they are a vital component of the military response to any crisis , and are critical to guaranteeing Europe ’ s security . given this , it is imperative that European governments adopt cost-cutting measures that do not jeopardize their naval assets .
first , the EU should take a leading role in maximizing the efficiency of each member state ’ s navy , by creating mechanisms that would facilitate the exchange of information between governments , maritime agencies , and navies . indeed , sound political decisions can achieve just as much as buying new ships – and at a far lower cost .
surveillance strategies , for example , are often more expensive than necessary , owing to poor communication . information-sharing among Europe ’ s navies would also help to identify and fill existing gaps , thus paving the way for a more efficient European maritime-security infrastructure .
at the same time , in order to maintain a security framework fit to confront any conceivable security threat , Europe ’ s governments should preserve the entire spectrum of their naval assets . Mothballing ships for the sake of saving money could have dire consequences for Europe ’ s security .
to this end , Europe ’ s navies and maritime agencies should merge their capabilities , especially those related to defense and security missions . this would bring massive savings , which could be reinvested in technological advances , thereby further equipping Europe ’ s navies to meet future threats .
accurately assessing maritime operations ’ success requires time and care , because naval capabilities cannot be built up quickly . while reducing such capabilities might seem like an expedient way to cut costs , European governments must not lose sight of their long-term security priorities .
above all , European leaders must promote increased naval cooperation . after all , naval capacities are essential to the projection of European power – and crucial to maintaining geopolitical stability around the world .
unity is Not Enough
the agreement needs to be followed by an effort to end the economic and administrative siege of Palestine , as well as serious peace talks with Israel aimed at ending the 39-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip . at home , the new government needs to pay its civil servants , restore law and order , and end the chaos that has become the norm in the Palestinian territories .
Palestinians complained that the international community acted unjustly , simply because they were unhappy with the result of a free and fair election in the Palestinian territories , which Hamas won overwhelmingly . the government created after the January 2006 elections has been unable to pay civil servants because of the international banking blockade and the refusal of Israel to transfer millions of tax dollars collected on behalf of the Palestinian people .
after months without pay , the government , headed by Hamas ’ s Ismael Haniyeh , was confronted with a serious challenge in September , when civil servants went on strike , demanding to be paid . the differences between the Fatah-led presidency of Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas ’ s Islamist government spilled into the streets .
with unemployment rising , income dropping to record low levels , and internal tensions escalating , fighting between supporters of Hamas and Fatah began . attempts to reconcile the parties began in Gaza , before moving to Cairo , Damascus , and finally Mecca under the supervision of Saudi King Abdullah , whose country has been a financial backer of the Palestinians for decades .
this includes the mutual recognition agreed by the PLO and Israel , as well as the Oslo Accords . by announcing the acceptance of previous agreements and supporting the Arab peace initiative , the new government should be able to bring economic normalcy to the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority .
the ceasefire understanding between Palestinian factions and Israel will need to be honored through the commitment of both sides and a parallel political process . the international community , especially the US , is giving verbal support to launching serious Palestinian-Israeli talks , and the Mecca Agreement paves the way for Abbas to negotiate an end to the occupation .
if resumption of political violence and property destruction is to be avoided , a new internal security policy will be needed . the numerous militias , groups , gangs , and individuals who own and use weapons must be controlled .
in order to end lawlessness , the Palestinian security leadership will need to lift the protection given to armed individuals who have been using their weapons with impunity to injure , kill , and destroy property . indeed , law and order must be the top priority of the unity government , owing to the need to restore the Palestinian public ’ s faith in Palestinian leaders from all factions .
for years , the world envied the Palestinian people ’ s strong social fiber , as they held together despite the occupation . with a strong sense of national identity , Palestinians boasted that they had a clear unifying purpose : ending the Israeli occupation and establishing an independent and democratic state .
but the recent months of infighting have left a deep wound among Palestinians . if that wound is to heal , much effort must be exerted to restore a functioning economy , strengthen internal security , and improve Palestinians ’ relations with their neighbors and the international community .
no Child Left Out
Seoul – On a recent visit to a camp for Syrian refugees in Turkey , I witnessed some of the most powerful displays of human endurance that anyone can imagine . and yet , amid all the stories of trauma and loss , what affected me the most was these refugee families ’ unquenchable thirst for education .
the children I spoke to told me of their continued desire to learn in the camp ’ s makeshift schools , crammed into classes and taught in shifts running from before dawn until after dark . their parents spoke of the hope they place in the transformative power of education .
now , with more than four million people forced to flee their homes because of the violence wracking the country , it has become one of the world ’ s many places suffering from what can only be described as a global education crisis . there are an estimated 58 million primary-school-aged children out of school worldwide , and those affected by conflict and natural disasters are among the hardest to reach .
worse , the number of child refugees cut off from school – in places like Nepal , Myanmar , and Yemen – is increasing at an alarming rate . if the international community does not act to nurture and educate these children , the cycle of poverty and conflict will be reproduced for generations to come .
the fact that so many children are cut off from education constitutes a clear failure on the part of the world ’ s governments , which promised in 2000 , when the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) were adopted , to ensure primary schooling for all children by 2015 . to achieve this , it is not enough to enroll children in school ; they must be kept there and provided a quality education .
this week , the international community will have a chance to do something about this scandalous state of affairs . policymakers from around the world will meet in South Korea at the World Education Forum to agree on the global education targets that are set to replace the MDGs .
some 8 % of South Korea ’ s GDP is spent on education , and UNESCO estimates that every dollar invested in primary schools generates $ 10- $ 15 in economic returns . South Korea , which has lifted itself up from the ranks of the world ’ s poorest countries to among its richest in just two generations , is living proof that education pays off .
success is measured not only by the number of children we enroll , nor by their achievements on standardized tests ; the most important outcomes are the tangible and intangible impacts of education on the quality of students ’ lives . this is the unfinished business of the MDGs .
wherever I travel with the Education Above All foundation , I encounter bright , motivated children who have been denied the chance to learn . as the world moves on to new priorities , we cannot forget our responsibility to those who have been failed by our complacency .
universities : renaissance or Decay ?
“ Europe ’ s universities , taken as a group , are failing to provide the intellectual and creative energy that is required to improve the continent ’ s poor economic performance . ” This dramatic statement introduces a new pamphlet whose subtitle , “ Renaissance or Decay , ” I have borrowed for this reflection .
the pamphlet ’ s two authors , Richard Lambert , a former editor of the Financial Times and future Director General of the Confederation of British Industry , and Nick Butler , the Group Vice President for Strategy and Policy Development at British Petroleum do not represent vested academic interests . what they say about Europe probably applies to most other parts of the world as well , though not to the United States .
Lambert and Butler identify four main weaknesses of European universities that must be addressed . they call for :
yet it is by no means certain that education systems in which 50 % or more of each generation strive to attain a university degree are best suited to cope with the exigencies of the twenty-first century . many jobs are , in fact , not “ high tech , ” but , in the words of Britain ’ s Adair Turner , “ high touch ” – service-sector jobs that do not require a university education .
they engage with students rather than eagerly awaiting breaks and holidays to pursue their own projects . they are true university teachers rather than people who invoke the “ unity of teaching and research ” in order to concentrate on research subjects and hope that teaching will take care of itself .
moreover , the research atmosphere of American universities is characterized by a great deal of informal cooperation . people meet in laboratories and seminars , but also in common rooms and cafeterias .
this is also what they miss even as they relapse into the bad old habits at home . as in so many other respects , universities not only in Europe , but also in Japan , South Korea , and developing parts of the world , including China and India , need to loosen rigid structures and habits to avoid decay and nurture a renaissance .
unleashing Africa ’ s Girl Power
but the headline figures often mask longer-term problems – not least , an over-reliance on natural resources and chronic inequalities . inclusive , sustainable growth is achievable , but only by tapping the continent ’ s greatest reserve of energy and creativity : African women and girls .
health and development experts , economists , non-governmental organizations , United Nations agencies , and banks agree that the key to unlocking Africa ’ s potential lies in expanding women ’ s education , freedom , and job opportunities .
studies suggest that equal access to resources would increase farm yields by 20-30 % , offsetting the effects of drought and climate change . access to education , capital , markets , and technologies would allow women to process , package , and market their products , especially for Africa ’ s growing middle class , bolstering both earnings and food supplies .
greater female participation in male-dominated occupations across the board would increase overall labor productivity by up to 25 % . the same is true of politics , where more female participation and leadership would improve governance and public services , as promising experiences in some parts of Africa and elsewhere have shown .
the first step to improving conditions for women must be to strengthen their sexual and reproductive health and rights – an issue concerning which Africa has some of the world ’ s worst indicators . simply put , women must be allowed to decide , free of coercion or violence , about their sexuality and health ; if , when , and whom to marry ; and whether and when to become a parent .
the costs usually strike in the prime of women ’ s economically productive lives , devaluing their future contributions to society . at the extreme , more than 400 African women and girls die every day during pregnancy or childbirth , scarring families and plunging surviving children into hardship .
the cost to society in lost income from death and disability is nearly $ 1 billion . almost all of these deaths occur in countries with restrictive abortion laws , which African leaders should consider reforming as a matter of common sense and social justice .
more than one-third of African girls marry before the age of 18 , which threatens their health , truncates their education , and lowers their aspirations for the future . they are also more likely than older women to die of birth-related complications , and are more prone to abuse .
roughly 90 % of the world ’ s pregnant women and children with HIV live in Africa , and , despite notable recent reductions in HIV transmission rates , adolescent girls are still more than twice as likely as boys of the same age to carry the virus . yet barely a third of young Africans know how to prevent HIV – another reason for urgent and comprehensive sexuality education .
in the case of female genital mutilation and child marriage , such violence is culturally sanctioned . we must change laws , judicial systems , and attitudes that exonerate the perpetrators , and we must provide help to victims .
the number of maternal deaths could fall by one-third , saving millions ( in developing countries overall , maternal and new-born health-care savings could reach $ 5.7 billion ) . however , the sad reality is that , despite support from various development partners and donors , assistance for reproductive health care and family planning fell by half in the last decade .
healthier , wealthier , and better-educated women tend to produce healthier , wealthier , and better-educated families , because women typically invest more of their earnings than men do in their children ’ s wellbeing . with the continent ’ s population forecast to double by 2050 , there is hardly a better time to invest in women and girls .
Europe ’ s Hidden Stimulus
London – When the European Council next meets , on February 7 , it should look at private investment as a means to kick-start Europe ’ s stagnant economy . with the usual drivers of GDP growth constrained across Europe , the one economic sector able to spend is the non-financial corporate sector .
unlocking that cash would give Europe a much larger stimulus package than any government can provide . in 2011 , for example , private investment in Europe totaled more than € 2 trillion , compared to government investment of less than € 300 billion .
in more than 40 past episodes in which GDP fell and private investment declined by 10 % , recovery took an average of five years . Europe is four years removed from the onset of recession , but private investment in 2011 was still lower than its 2007 level in 26 of the European Union ’ s 27 member states .
to be sure , the fact that companies are holding on to their cash , rather than paying it out in dividends , signals that they expect investment opportunities to return – a far more positive situation than in Japan , for example , where companies lack cash to invest . but European companies remain hesitant , despite low interest rates , keeping private investment well below its previous peak .
governments can help to persuade companies to let go of their cash by removing regulatory barriers such as zoning regulations in retail and a plethora of requirements in the construction sector concerning everything from the height of ceilings to the size of staircase areas . they should also address the lack of uniform standards across Europe ’ s internal borders ; for example , there are 11 separate signaling systems for rail freight in the EU-15 .
after Sweden eased planning laws in its retail sector during the 1990 ’ s , the country posted the strongest retail productivity growth in Europe ( and outstripped that of the United States ) between 1995 and 2005 . standardization and liberalization in European telecoms underpinned 9 % growth in value added and productivity in this period , compared to 6 % growth in the US .
the largest scope for renewed private investment is in capital-intensive sectors in which government has a major presence as regulator . even if European countries were to close only 10 % of the variation in capital stock per worker at the subsector level , the impact could be more than € 360 billion in additional investment – offsetting the € 354 billion difference in private investment between 2007 and 2011 .
many projects , from airports to university campuses , benefit from returns over decades , which implies that weak demand in the short term will have only a limited impact on their overall viability . even among more near-term projects , some – for example , retrofitting buildings with more energy-efficient features – could become viable with action from policymakers .
this approach is not about “ picking winners and losers . ” It is about targeted microeconomic reforms that reduce or remove barriers to private investment , thereby encouraging the non-financial corporate sector to propel European GDP growth .
first , governments need to focus on sectors in which action is likely to trigger renewed investment on a scale large enough to boost GDP – and quickly enough to enable private investment to drive the recovery . governments often become enamored of innovative sectors , such as semiconductors , that account for only a very small share of total investment .
in fact , construction and real estate are the most promising candidates , as they account for roughly one-third of European fixed investment and more than 17 million jobs . although these sectors are unlikely to rebound to pre-crisis levels in Greece , Ireland , and Spain for many years , other European economies , including the United Kingdom , Italy , and Sweden , as well as some Eastern European economies , have scope for further investment .
to meet Europe ’ s ambitious 2020 energy targets , retrofitting existing buildings and improving new buildings ’ energy efficiency , including the use of more energy-efficient materials and equipment , could lead to roughly € 37 billion in additional annual investment between now and 2030 . in most European countries , action to spur private investment in local services and transport – both large sectors – should also be considered .
governments , however , need to understand the barriers to investment : regulatory failures ; weak enablers , including financial and human capital ; poor infrastructure ; and substandard technology . and they must undertake rigorous cost-benefit analyses , in order to ensure that any intervention translates into private investment that promotes productivity growth .
it is here – at the level of execution – that governments often perform poorly . too often , they spend money to support private-sector projects that fail to provide a positive return for the broader economy .
three ingredients are vital to getting it right : backing for initiatives at the highest political level ; participation by all key stakeholders in deciding what action to take and driving its implementation ; and establishing small , high-powered delivery units with clear mandates to coordinate interventions .
Europe ’ s leaders need to put private investment at the center of their growth strategy by devising policies that open the gates to large potential flows . the European Council meeting on February 7 is an ideal opportunity to make a start .
unmasking the Man with the Wooden Face
ever since he became General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President of the Peoples ’ Republic of China four years ago , Hu Jintao has remained infuriatingly wooden-faced and opaque . over the past year , however , the shroud of mystery has begun to drop .
it was the late patriarch Deng Xiaoping who in 1992 made the surprising demand that Hu , former Secretary of the Communist Youth League and protégé of ousted party chief Hu Yaobang , be inducted into the Chinese Communist Party ’ s ( CCP ) Politburo Standing Committee . Deng , in effect , personally designated Hu as successor to President Jiang Zemin .
Hu pledged to replace Deng ’ s elitist ethos of “ letting one part of the population get rich first ” – a policy that has produced a staggering wealth gap – with a more egalitarian approach . as part of his government ’ s efforts “ to construct a harmonious society , ” a tax on agricultural produce was scrapped last year , while the State Council vowed to boost annual investment in rural infrastructure .
Hu ’ s Politburo has consistently refused to let peasants set up non-official farmers ’ associations or trade unions . at the same time , it has allowed farmers across China to fall victim to an epidemic of illegal land grabs by local governments and developers .
not only has Hu ’ s administration failed to protect the rights of the poor and the oppressed , but police and government-hired thugs now frequently harass lawyers and other activists who lobby on behalf of the country ’ s dispossessed . Chen Guangcheng , a blind lawyer – famous for exposing a forced abortion scandal in Shandong – was given a four-year jail term on the dubious charge of “ organizing a mob to disturb traffic . ”
in a landmark speech on administrative restructuring in 1980 , Deng underscored the urgency of bringing about a “ separation of party and government . ” Hu , by contrast , seems to find little fault with the status quo , under which the Party remains in charge of not only government , but also state enterprises .
it is also becoming increasingly clear that Hu will continue to rely on a variety of politically retrograde propaganda tactics . he has revived the use of ideological campaigns , akin to those used during the Cultural Revolution , such as a requirement that Party members study The Collected Works of Jiang Zemin .
in a speech marking the Great Helmsman ’ s 110th birthday in late 2003 , he declared Mao to be a “ great proletariat revolutionary strategist and theorist . ” While Deng had castigated Mao ’ s “ leftist ” errors , Hu ’ s hagiographic address made no mention of his manifold blunders .
moreover , Hu has fomented nationalism , not by taking understandable pride in China ’ s impressive economic growth , but by demonizing Japan . he has become increasingly reliant on the facile notion that state-sponsored patriotism and nationalism can hold China ’ s disparate groups together .
Hu is due to remain in power until 2012 . given the economy ’ s solid performance and the docility of China ’ s population , there seems little doubt that Hu ’ s twenty-first-century market dictatorship will preserve the Party ’ s mandate to continue ruling – for now .
but it is equally obvious that Hu , the sphinx-like apparatchik in whom Chinese and Western liberals alike had once invested hope , is unlikely to deliver the more open and humane China that they thought he had promised . China under Hu has perhaps found its development model : a form of Leninist capitalism with no aspirations toward a more democratic form of governance .
unpredictable Russia
when he first arrived in Paris in 2000 as the newly elected President of Russia , Vladimir Putin had a simple and reassuring message to convey . “ I am bringing you what you need most : a stable and guaranteed source of energy .
Putin ’ s implicit point was that “ Christian energy , ” even if “ Orthodox , ” would be more reassuringly certain than “ Muslim energy ” for a Western world jittery about stability in the Middle East .
the Middle East was supposed to be messy and unpredictable , unlike the new and modern Russia of Putin . the problem today is that for Ukrainians , Georgians , not to mention Italians , “ Christian ” oil and gas from Russia does not seem nearly as secure and as fail-proof as Putin promised .
what is becoming clearer by the day is that the formula defining Western policy towards Russia since communism ’ s collapse – “ Let ’ s engage Russia if we can , let ’ s contain Russia if we must ” – must now be completely rethought . the West has largely failed to engage Russia either as a European or Western ally .
indeed , today ’ s Russians have no nostalgia for the Yeltsin years , which they associate with confusion , humiliation , shame and weakness . for most Russians , the emergence of an independent civil society and the first fluttering of an inconstant democratic wind could not balance the deep national frustration felt over the loss of empire and shattered status .
besides , what would a containment policy applied to Russia today look like ? Russia ’ s leaders , tucked behind the political safety cushion provided by high energy prices , rightly feel that time is working in their favor , that “ we ” in the West need Russia more than Russia needs us .
indeed , escalating tensions in the Middle East – particularly Iran ’ s nuclear ambition – is likely to incline the US to overlook Russia ’ s diplomatic prickliness even more . rapid economic growth in China and India means that both countries will give primacy to a stable flow of energy – and therefore to placid relations with Russia .
the diplomats surrounding Putin may find it natural , given their training , to apply the old Soviet-era methods , and may believe that the moment has come to undo yesterday ’ s humiliation . defending Russia ’ s national interests , in their view , demands hard bargaining tactics , even if these now verge on the comical , as in the recent case of supposed British spies hiding secrets in a rock in a Moscow park .
an axis between Paris , Berlin , and Moscow never really made sense even when Schroeder was in power in Germany . it is even more absurd today , with Angela Merkel – someone who is without illusions about Russia – as German Chancellor .
heavy-handed diplomatic pressure – such as threats to exclude Russia from the G8 – must be a weapon of last resort . but resigned acquiescence in whatever Putin ’ s regime chooses to do would only confirm it in its belief that it now holds all the cards .
the only secure , predictable Russia is one that offers not “ Christian energy , ” but “ rule of law energy . ” The “ democratic energy ” of Norway may constitute too distant a goal , but Russia ’ s role as a predictable energy supplier requires ending the reign of corruption .
we in the West may badly need Russia ’ s energy , but if Russia does not want its future to degenerate into Oriental despotism , it must engage with the West in good faith . if Putin genuinely seeks to bolster Russia ’ s global standing , he must not allow Russians ’ sense of humiliation in the years since the Soviet collapse to stand in the way .
clearing A Path Through the Brain
Madrid – Our brains are like a dense forest – a complex , seemingly impenetrable terrain of interacting neurons that mediates cognition and behavior . the great challenge is to uncover its mysteries , that is , to find out how the neurons are structured and mutually connected .
in general , the exchange of information between the billions of neurons that make up the neuronal forest takes place through two types of highly specialized structures : chemical synapses ( the majority ) and so-called gap junctions ( a substrate of one class of electrical synapse ) . chemical synaptic transmission involves the release of specific molecules , neurotransmitters , which diffuse through the intercellular space and interact with specific receptors located on an adjacent neuron .
a very dense network of processes occupies the space between the cell bodies of the neurons , neuroglia ( cells that support and protect neurons ) , and blood vessels . this space ( the neuropil ) represents 90-98 % of the volume of the human cerebral cortex , with an estimated one billion synapses per cubic millimeter of neuropil .
likewise , not all electrical transmission is mediated by gap junctions , and these forms involve different specialized structures . in addition , electrical interactions take place between closely apposed neuronal elements without obvious membrane specializations .
furthermore , it has been proposed that glial cells are involved in information processing through their bi-directional signaling with neurons . and we now know that the activity of neuronal circuits is strongly influenced by neuromodulators ( such as dopamine , serotonin , and acetylcholine ) , which are secreted by a small group of neurons and diffuse through large regions of the nervous system .
the neuronal circuits involved in reflexes are a typical example – relatively simple , fast , automatic actions that occur at a subconscious level . other , much more complex functions related to the synaptome include information processing in large but discrete circuits in the sensory and motor systems and in the brain regions associated with language , calculation , writing , and reasoning .
the modulatory systems , however , act on multiple neuronal circuits and brain areas . this diffuse action is related to the overall moods and states of the brain ( for example , attentiveness , sleep , and anxiety ) .
nevertheless , even using this technology , full reconstruction of whole brains is possible only for relatively simple nervous systems . indeed , even for a small mammal like the mouse , it is impossible to reconstruct the brain completely at the ultrastructural level , because the magnification needed to visualize synapses yields relatively small images .
by combining these detailed structural data with the incomplete light and electron microscopy wiring diagrams , it could be possible to generate a realistic statistical model , rather than attempting to reconstruct the brain in its entirety . computational models of neuronal networks based on real circuits already have become useful tools to study aspects of the functional organization of the brain .
thus , although a true synaptome of the mammalian brain is a chimerical quest , it is possible that in the near future we will be able to construct a “ silicon cortex , ” a computerized machine based on a realistic model of the complete anatomical , physiological , and molecular design of the cortical circuit . if we succeed , we will finally be able to see the forest – without having to look for every tree .
unsafe at Any Speed ?
Tokyo – At least 38 people were killed and more than 200 injured by the recent crash of two high-speed trains near Zhenzhou in Zhejiang , a province in China . the wrecked body of the ruined train was buried immediately afterward , with no investigation .
the intellectual-property dispute between Japan and China over the technology used in China ’ s new bullet trains was heated even before the accident . in the wake of the crash , the dispute has come to a boil .
the Shinkansen super bullet train , which was directly affected by the earthquake that devastated northeast Japan in March , was able to resume operations on April 29 . the latest-model Japanese bullet train , the Hayabusa , which made its debut only a week before the earthquake , can operate at 320 kilometers ( 200 miles ) per hour – and now does , following quick repairs to its line .
since it began operating between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka in 1964 , Japan ’ s Shinkansen has served as a vital transport artery in Japan , and has suffered no fatal accidents . let me reiterate : not a single person has died in a Shinkansen accident .
THSR connects Taipei and Kaohsiung , which are 345 kilometers apart , in 90 minutes . as a result of a renewed emphasis on safety following an earthquake , the Taiwanese authorities decided to use Japanese technology for the rolling stock and a mixture of German and French technology for other facilities and operations .
on June 30 , the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway , covering the 1,318 kilometers between China ’ s two most important cities at approximately 300 kilometers per hour , began operating , timed to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China . the rolling stock for China ’ s CRH380A bullet train is based on technology from Kawasaki Heavy Industries , whereas the German company Siemens provided the technology for the CRH380B .
one reason why Japan hesitated to export its high-speed rail technology was revealed by JR Tokai Chairman Takayuki Kasai , who wanted to make its provision conditional upon the “ country being politically stable and governed by the rule of law . ” He regularly highlighted the importance of compliance with enforceable contracts that would guarantee intellectual property rights .
immediately before the Beijing-Shanghai railway was built , the Chinese Ministry for Railways initiated international patent claims concerning the technology used in the CRH380A . it is believed that China has now filed for 21 patents in accordance with the Patent Cooperation Treaty ( PCT ) , with the aim of obtaining patents in Japan , the United States , Brazil , Europe , and Russia .
since 2003 , China has filed for 1,902 patents related to high-speed railways , with 1,421 approved and 481 still being examined . but the 21 recent applications are the first based upon Japanese Shinkansen technology .
the originality remains unknown for now , because the content of the patent application will not become clear until the 18 months required for investigating prior art has elapsed . but there is a strong view that the technology is an extension of that provided by either Japan or Germany , and the case could well lead to a major intellectual-property dispute .
for example , a Chinese animation called “ Train Hero ” received much criticism in Chinese Internet circles when it was found to be nearly identical to the popular Japanese animation called “ Japan Hikarian Railroad . ” Not only was the story the same , but it even took shortcuts , such as having characters eat onigiri rice balls , a Japanese food not eaten in China .
the market for Shinkansen technology is growing not only in China , but also in the US ( where the state of California wants to build such a system ) and in emerging-market countries such as Brazil . with demand extremely large , international competition to construct high-speed railway networks is becoming intense , as the lobbying for the California contract demonstrates .
so long as protection of intellectual-property rights in China is woefully inadequate , the high-speed rail market is likely to remain riddled with heated disputes . in China , the rush to apply for patents is sometimes said to be about saving face with ordinary Chinese , who might well object to buying technology from abroad when China ’ s government so often lauds homegrown technology .
the Politics of UN Leadership
in the United States , for example , ambitious politicians are already campaigning hard in bellwether states for the 2016 presidential election . yet some races – such as that for the next United Nations secretary-general , which will also be held in 2016 – still occur largely under the radar .
( the only exception was the extremely popular and well-regarded Kofi Annan , who , despite having succeeded another African after one term , was selected for two consecutive terms . ) With the position having cycled , since 1971 , through Western Europe , Latin America , Africa , and Asia – Ban Ki-moon , the current second-term secretary-general , hails from South Korea – only one UN region has yet to be represented : Eastern Europe .
former Slovenian President Danilo Türk , who served as Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs under Annan , is an early front-runner . there is also talk of current UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova , who is Bulgarian , and of two Slovaks , Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajčák and his predecessor , Jan Kubiš , entering the race .
the fact that all five of these candidates are well known in diplomatic circles , and four have direct UN experience , refutes the old canard that Eastern Europe does not have a credible candidate to offer . ( full disclosure : all five are friends of mine , and I consider them highly capable and well suited for the role . )
but there is a hitch : Eastern Europe must avoid attracting a Russian veto . indeed , that may be the main factor derailing the prospects of former Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski .
the 2006 election , in which I finished a close second out of seven candidates , featured an unprecedented level of public exposure , with candidates meeting with UN regional groups , addressing the annual African Union summit , and even participating in a debate on the BBC . Web sites emerged for the sole purpose of analyzing the race .
all of this represented an important step forward . given the importance of the UN secretary-general ’ s vision , candidates should have the opportunity to share their ideas and goals publicly , as I was committed to doing .
ultimately , however , the public campaign had little impact on the outcome , exemplified in the fact that Ban did not participate in the BBC debate . though efforts to share one ’ s vision can win a candidate wide expressions of support , they can do the same for his or her opponents – and , in the election of a UN secretary-general , Security Council members can vote for as many candidates as they like .
in 2006 , South Korea launched a yearlong , amply-financed outreach campaign that targeted all 15 Security Council members with official visits in their capitals , and that often dangled significant bilateral carrots – gestures that other candidates had neither the time nor the resources to offer . indeed , South Korea was the only Security Council member country to conduct such a campaign .
the obvious conclusion is that the contest for UN Secretary-General is about neither vision nor the best resume , language skills , administrative ability , or even personal charisma . it is a political decision , made principally by the P-5 .
the result is that the “ least unacceptable ” candidate gets the job . and , as it stands , there is no reason to believe that the advent of social media , satellite television coverage , or a more intrusive press will change that fundamental reality .
in 2016 , the smart money will be on an East European candidate acceptable to the P-5 , particularly Russia . how agreement on the candidate will be achieved is anyone ’ s guess .
the Security Council ’ s Credibility Test
world War II ’ s victors – the United States , the United Kingdom , France , Russia , and China – will continue to hold the box seats , which come with veto power . five new non-permanent members – New Zealand , Spain , Angola , Malaysia , and Venezuela – will rotate in for a two-year term , replacing Australia , Luxembourg , Rwanda , South Korea , and Argentina , respectively .
aside from Nigeria , none of the twenty-first century ’ s other major players – including Brazil , Germany , India , Japan , and South Africa – will have a ticket . all efforts to reform the Security Council ’ s structure – even an end to prohibiting immediate re-election of non-permanent members , which would enable continuous engagement , if not formal permanent membership – have ground to a halt .
the Council ’ s institutional legitimacy as the world ’ s foremost decision-maker on issues of peace and security cannot be taken for granted . if the Council continues to look the way it does , it is only a matter of time – maybe another 15 years at best – before its credibility and authority for most of the world diminish to dangerous levels .
the challenges that the Council faces today are as acute as they have ever been . more crises have been erupting in more places , more breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law have been occurring , and more people have been displaced by conflict than has been the case for decades .
it did well to force Syria to give up its chemical weapons , and to authorize humanitarian access without the regime ’ s consent . it has authorized more peacekeepers in the field , with more robust civilian-protection mandates , than ever before .
it stopped an imminent massacre in Libya in 2011 by agreeing ( at least at the outset ) that the internationally agreed “ responsibility to protect ” justified military action . it responded decisively to the Ebola crisis , and has passed some important counter-terrorism resolutions .
too often the Security Council goes missing on the world ’ s most serious security and human rights problems , constrained by Realpolitik , out-of-date thinking , timidity , institutional limitations , or inadequate resources . in the most alarming recent crises – Ukraine , Gaza , Syria , and Iraq – it has been almost totally paralyzed .
a good starting point would be to apply existing best practice more often , making exceptional cases the norm . the Council can deliver results , as it showed with Syria ’ s chemical arsenal , when it establishes clear benchmarks , explicit timelines , active monitoring mechanisms , regular reporting processes , and consequences for non-compliance .
it needs to acknowledge that anticipating and responding to major human-rights violations are part of its core business . it should encourage the UN ’ s secretary-general to be less nervous about using his formidable authority under Article 99 of the Charter to bring matters to the Council ’ s attention on his own .
though the UK has said that the proposal should be considered , Russia is openly opposed . meanwhile , the US is quietly uncomfortable , and China , too , has remained silent .
these reactions are a reminder that the biggest changes that the Security Council needs are to the mindset of its permanent members .
unsettling America
whether “ democracy ” will ensue is much more dubious . judging on the basis of Pakistan , and much of the rest of the Muslim world , periods of ( corrupt ) civilian rule will alternate with “ cleansing ” military coups .
freedom of expression is in their bones ; mass protests their visual lifeblood . they try to report the world as it is , but theirs is not the world of most people – their business depends on the disruption of “ ordinary ” business , so they systematically underestimate people ’ s desire for law and order ( or at least order ) .
otherwise , there is no explanation for the longevity of dictatorships such as Mubarak ’ s 30-year rule . likewise , in the referendum that ended his 16-year rule in Chile in 1990 , General Augusto Pinochet , with thousands of tortured and vanished victims in his grisly cupboard , ran on a law-and-order platform and received 44 % of the vote .
this is what they want to happen in Egypt , hoping that democracy will not jeopardize Egypt ’ s peace treaty with Israel . but Western democracies ’ combination of freedom and order – the West ’ s most precious gift to the world – is the product of a long history that cannot be replicated in short order .
non-Western political systems are typically archaic : good rulers can sleep soundly at night , while bad rulers face continual danger of overthrow from the army or the streets . most non-Western peoples rely upon the ruler ’ s personal virtues , not institutional limits on his power , to make their lives tolerable .
yet all of this leaves out the possibility of change , particularly change influenced by the United States ’ unsettling role in the world . the idea that the US is a status quo power is a delusion of international-relations experts .
where America has room for maneuver , it always presses forward in this direction . and , despite the rise of China and the move to a more “ plural ” international system , the US still has the power to change “ facts on the ground ” in large parts of the world , particularly the Middle East .
experts have always underestimated the expansionary character of American foreign policy , because they think of expansion in old-world terms : conquest , imperialism , and colonialism . the US does not seek to create an empire in the old sense : America pursues an imperialism of the values that it holds dear .
if all countries have the same values , traditional imperialism becomes obsolete . though it clearly lacks the power to impose its values by force , the US certainly has the power to unsettle established conditions , both through the attraction of its “ soft power ” ( the American way of life ) and by the exemplary use of force .
parts of the invasion and occupation were certainly badly mishandled by the US , leading to a much greater loss of life than was necessary . but , taking the long view , can anyone doubt that the invasion had the effect of shaking up the pieces , not just in Iraq , but across the Islamic chessboard ?
that is why I am not at all sure that the street uprisings in Egypt , following those in Tunisia , and now spreading to other Muslim-majority countries , can be interpreted simply as traditional forms of protest against bad rulers . throughout the Muslim world , there is a sense of enlarged possibilities , especially among the young : more than half of Egypt ’ s 80 million people are under 25 .
his intention is quite clear : “ Man ’ s active nature , flagging , seeks too soon the level ; Unqualified repose he learns to crave , Whence , willingly , the comrade him I gave , Who works , excites , and must create , as Devil . ”
so is America , always stirring sleepy societies out of their torpor – a role begun when Commodore Matthew Perry “ opened up ” Japan in 1854 . if we want to hold fast to any vision of progress , this is an indispensable role , and only America can play it today .
true , America ’ s intervention in the Middle East also strengthened extremist Islam , breeding on the resentment that the US presence arouses . but , taking the long view , the future surely does not lie with organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood .

the Old New Financial Risk
Washington , DC – The main financial risk facing the United States today looks very similar to what caused so much trouble in 2007-2008 : big banks with too much debt and too little equity capital on their balance sheets . uneven global regulations , not to mention regulators who fall asleep at the wheel , compound this structural vulnerability .
we already saw this movie , and it ended badly . next time could be an even worse horror show .
all booms are different , but every major financial crisis has at its heart the same issue : major banks get into trouble and teeter on the brink of collapse . disruption at the core of any banking system leads to tight credit , with major negative effects on the real economy .
the most important question to ask of any financial system is how much loss-absorbing equity major banks have on their balance sheets . when a company suffers losses , its shareholder equity falls in value , and less equity means that the company is more likely to default on its debts .
and we should also be very careful about the accounting used for derivatives . on this technical but crucial point , US generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) are considerably more generous ( because they understate potential losses ) than International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) .
Thomas Hoenig , vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , publishes his own calculation of capital levels at the world ’ s largest banks , and these data are now available through the end of 2014 . the most leveraged big US bank , Morgan Stanley , has less than 4 % equity , meaning that 96 % of its balance sheet is some form of debt .
at the end of 2012 , when Hoenig started to publish his US GAAP-IFRS adjustment , the average for the largest US banks was roughly 4 % equity . it is possible to argue that this key measure is moving in the right direction , but the pace of improvement is glacial at best .
for example , assets may prove less liquid than investors suppose , as happened with money market funds in 2008 ; today , skeptics worry about exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) . or overly complex securities could become hard to price .
or perhaps the shock will affect sovereign-debt values in faraway places , as happened in 1982 . it is striking that no experts – public or private – really have a firm grip on what could happen if there is another round of difficulties with Greek government debt .
but , as Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets points out , when pressure mounts and a crisis seems around the corner , banks will face great pressure to bring such subsidiaries back onto their balance sheet . this is exactly what happened in the last crisis , with Citigroup being a leading example .
sometimes this may be due to lack of information or awareness . but , in many cases , the regulators actually believe that there is nothing wrong with the behavior in question – either because they have been persuaded by lobbyists or because they themselves used to work in the industry ( or could go work there soon . )
sound familiar ?
America Adrift
to minimize the impact of both consequences , the United States now must enforce with utmost determination its agreement with Russia on eliminating Syria ’ s chemical weapons . but will it do so ?
US Secretary of State John Kerry ’ s heat-of-the-moment comment that a military strike on Syria could be avoided if all chemical weapons were turned over was a diplomatic gift to Russia , and it responded with alacrity . not usually noted for its diplomatic dexterity , the Kremlin quickly proposed compelling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ’ s regime to join the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) , and to place its chemical-weapons stockpile under United Nations control .
Egypt ’ s old-new military rulers , for example , have concluded that American criticism can be ignored , because America cannot cut off its aid to Egypt for geopolitical reasons . when I met with Egypt ’ s foreign minister , Nabil Fahmy , in August , he hinted at the new regime ’ s dissatisfaction with attempts by the European Union and the US to influence his country ’ s domestic affairs .
of course , appeals to “ stability ” are nothing new from authoritarian governments . as Pakistan ’ s then-president , Pervez Musharraf , dismissively put it when I visited Islamabad as Japan ’ s defense minister , “ Democracy ?
the US , of course , claims that it , too , knows all about democracy . but its diplomatic cognitive dissonance – criticizing the Egyptian regime while continuing to supply it with military hardware – can serve only to undermine bilateral relations , just as the same American approach to Musharraf ’ s regime thoroughly eroded US-Pakistani ties .
in November 2009 , when Obama visited Japan for the first time as President , he emphasized that he was from Hawaii and proud to be “ Americans ’ first Pacific president . ” Two years later , then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton published “ America ’ s Pacific Century , ” indicating a shift in America ’ s global strategy .
this declaration of a “ return to Asia ” marked the start of the famous “ pivot ” to the Pacific in US foreign policy – a shift away from the Middle East that was intended to meet the challenges posed by China ’ s growing geopolitical ambitions . all of Asia ’ s democracies ( and a few of its autocracies , particularly Vietnam ) welcomed it .
in particular , there is a gnawing fear that the US may yet choose the “ G-2 ” option : a grand bargain with China for the two countries to decide Asia ’ s fate by themselves and over our heads . given the size and clout of countries like India , Japan , Indonesia , and South Korea , such a condominium is , no doubt , doomed to failure .
but Abe ’ s government also recognizes that the world ’ s geopolitical tectonic plates are shifting , and that many in the US are tempted by the siren song of isolationism . so Abe feels obliged to put Japan in a position to be able to help Asia ’ s democracies manage any crisis that may emerge in the event of a change in America ’ s regional presence .
she will find a Japan renewing itself and its commitment to Asia ’ s freedoms . may that example , similar to her father ’ s appeal 53 years ago for the defense of freedom , also call forth the best in the American spirit .
the Return of the Dollar
in the last four months alone , it has soared by more than 7 % compared with a basket of more than a dozen global currencies , and by even more against the euro and the Japanese yen . this dollar rally , the result of genuine economic progress and divergent policy developments , could contribute to the “ rebalancing ” that has long eluded the world economy .
two major factors are currently working in the dollar ’ s favor , particularly compared to the euro and the yen . first , the United States is consistently outperforming Europe and Japan in terms of economic growth and dynamism – and will likely continue to do so – owing not only to its economic flexibility and entrepreneurial energy , but also to its more decisive policy action since the start of the global financial crisis .
second , after a period of alignment , the monetary policies of these three large and systemically important economies are diverging , taking the world economy from a multi-speed trajectory to a multi-track one . indeed , whereas the US Federal Reserve terminated its large-scale securities purchases , known as “ quantitative easing ” ( QE ) , last month , the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank recently announced the expansion of their monetary-stimulus programs .
specifically , an appreciating dollar improves the price competitiveness of European and Japanese companies in the US and other markets , while moderating some of the structural deflationary pressure in the lagging economies by causing import prices to rise .
to be sure , this risk was more acute when a larger number of emerging-economy currencies were pegged to the US dollar , which meant that a significant shift in the dollar ’ s value would weaken other countries ’ balance-of-payments position and erode their international reserves , thereby undermining their creditworthiness . today , many of these countries have adopted more flexible exchange-rate regimes , and quite a few retain adequate reserve holdings .
but a new issue risks bringing about a similarly problematic outcome : by repeatedly repressing financial-market volatility over the last few years , central-bank policies have inadvertently encouraged excessive risk-taking , which has pushed many financial-asset prices higher than economic fundamentals warrant . to the extent that continued currency-market volatility spills over into other markets – and it will – the imperative for stronger economic fundamentals to validate asset prices will intensify .
this is not to say that the currency re-alignment that is currently underway is necessarily a problematic development ; on the contrary , it has the potential to boost the global economy by supporting the recovery of some of its most challenged components .
after all , global growth , at its current level , is inadequate for mere redistribution among countries to work . overall global GDP needs to increase .
it is up to governments to ensure that the ongoing currency re-alignment supports a balanced , stable , and sustainable economic recovery . otherwise , they may find themselves again in the unpleasant business of mitigating financial instability .
Western Politics ’ Locust Years
new YORK – Since my teenage years , I have been fascinated by the permutations and machinations of national politics . today , I find myself focusing on broader political trends that also help to explain global economic issues .
fringe movements , some operating within established political structures , and others seeking to create new ones , are placing pressure on traditional parties , making it difficult for them to mobilize their supporters , and , in some cases , causing them real damage . desperate not to appear weak , long-established parties have become wary of cooperating across the aisle .
the resulting refusal to work together on the major issues of the day has had a dramatic impact on economic policies . once formulated through negotiations conducted at the political center , where Western democracies have long been anchored , policymaking is increasingly shaped by stubborn forces on the extreme left and right .
but the overall result has been policy paralysis , with even the most basic elements of economic governance ( such as actively passing a budget in the United States ) suffering as a result . needless to say , the greater the governance and policy challenges at home , the more difficult regional and global cooperation becomes .
the Tea Party in the US is a case in point . after its success on the national stage in the 2010 midterm congressional election , many Republican lawmakers became so concerned about securing their party ’ s “ base ” for future re-election bids that they no longer felt comfortable pursuing the type of bipartisan cooperation that underpin effective economic policymaking .
by contributing to a shutdown of federal-government operations and repeatedly raising the threat of a technical default , it risked undermining an already-fragile US economic recovery . while the movement has evolved and no longer threatens to hold the economy hostage , it continues to contribute to overall policy paralysis .
Europe now seems to be headed down a similar path , as non-traditional parties – many of them driven by single issues – become increasingly influential . movements like France ’ s anti-immigration National Front are making leading mainstream parties more likely to pander to extremists in order to preserve their support .
of course , their fear is not irrational , as Pasok , a long-established left-wing party in Greece , found out when the far-left , anti-austerity Syriza Party surged to victory in January . but that does not change the fact that parties ’ need to address their electoral fears is causing serious damage to national policymaking .
indeed , most established parties are so busy playing defense that they have little inclination to engage in the type of forward-looking strategic thinking that is needed to re-energize exhausted growth models , anchor financial stability , and ensure that technological innovation enables broad-based prosperity . as a result , Western economies are running chronically below their potential – and risk undermining their future potential .
that is why future generations will likely remember this as a time of lost economic opportunities . instead of bowing to polarization and paralysis , policymakers should be promoting growth- and productivity-enhancing infrastructure investments , funded at exceptionally low interest rates , scaling up labor-market reforms , and working to address the growing income and wealth inequality that is increasingly limiting access to economic opportunity .
likewise , policymakers should be revamping incoherent and inconsistent tax structures that are riddled with unfair exemptions . and they should be pursuing immigration reform to overhaul a system that penalizes talent , encourages malfeasance , and , as illustrated by the thousands of migrants who have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea in recent years while trying to reach Europe , often leads to human tragedy .
despite widespread dissatisfaction with political institutions in many Western countries – the US Congress , for example , has very low approval ratings – it is difficult to see what will break the current logjam . within established parties , forces promoting rejuvenation are weak and uneven .
for their part , many of the fringe parties , despite their rising popularity , are struggling to achieve power , a challenge illustrated in the recent British election . and those that succeed , such as Syriza , quickly become frustrated by the largely immovable systems in which they must operate – a situation that their lack of governing experience makes all the more difficult .
over time , Western political systems will evolve to meet the needs of their economies . but , in the interim , the vast majority of companies and households will have to cope with systems that do relatively less to help them reach their potential , placing them at a disadvantage vis-à-vis competitors operating in more supportive systems .
to some extent , technological innovation will pick up the slack , as it empowers individuals and companies to live more self-directed lives , creating pockets of excellence and wellbeing . but , while this is good news for some , it is inadequate to arrest the rising inequality of income , wealth , and opportunity – or to unleash the inclusive prosperity that Western economies can and should be generating .
Fed Up with the Fed
new YORK – At the end of every August , central bankers and financiers from around the world meet in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , for the US Federal Reserve ’ s economic symposium . this year , the participants were greeted by a large group of mostly young people , including many African- and Hispanic Americans .
they wanted the assembled policymakers to know that their decisions affect ordinary people , not just the financiers who are worried about what inflation does to the value of their bonds or what interest-rate hikes might do to their stock portfolios . and their green tee shirts were emblazoned with the message that for these Americans , there has been no recovery .
even now , seven years after the global financial crisis triggered the Great Recession , “ official ” unemployment among African-Americans is more than 9 % . according to a broader ( and more appropriate ) definition , which includes part-time employees seeking full-time jobs and marginally employed workers , the unemployment rate for the United States as a whole is 10.3 % .
so far this year , real wages for non-supervisory workers fell by nearly 0.5 % . this is part of a long-term trend that explains why household incomes in the middle of the distribution are lower than they were a quarter-century ago .
but , with the bulk of the increase in incomes since the US “ recovery ” began going to the top 1 % of earners , it is not true for most communities . the young people at Jackson Hole , representing a national movement called , naturally , “ Fed Up , ” could attest to that .
there is strong evidence that economies perform better with a tight labor market and , as the International Monetary Fund has shown , lower inequality ( and the former typically leads to the latter ) . of course , the financiers and corporate executives who pay $ 1,000 to attend the Jackson Hole meeting see things differently : low wages mean high profits , and low interest rates mean high stock prices .
it has been more than successful at the second , partly because it has been less than successful at the first . so why will policymakers be considering an interest-rate hike at the Fed ’ s September meeting ?
that is obviously not the case now . indeed , given wage stagnation and the strong dollar , inflation is well below the Fed ’ s own 2 % target , not to mention the 4 % rate for which many economists ( including the International Monetary Fund ’ s former chief economist , Olivier Blanchard ) have argued .
there is essentially no risk that the economy would overheat so quickly that the Fed could not intervene in time to prevent excessive inflation . whatever the unemployment rate at which inflationary pressures become significant – a key question for policymakers – we know that it is far lower than the rate today .
if the Fed focuses excessively on inflation , it worsens inequality , which in turn worsens overall economic performance . wages falter during recessions ; if the Fed then raises interest rates every time there is a sign of wage growth , workers ’ share will be ratcheted down – never recovering what was lost in the downturn .
in a well-functioning economy , one would have expected the low cost of capital to be the basis of healthy growth . in the US , workers are being asked to sacrifice their livelihoods and wellbeing to protect well-heeled financiers from the consequences of their own recklessness .
the Fed should simultaneously stimulate the economy and tame the financial markets . good regulation means more than just preventing the banking sector from harming the rest of us ( though the Fed didn ’ t do a very good job of that before the crisis ) .
I often feel a great deal of sympathy for Fed officials , because they must make close calls in an environment of considerable uncertainty . but the call right now is not a close one .
fiscal Challenges and Fiscal Follies
will the recovery continue at its frustratingly slow pace ? or will it accelerate as the housing sector rebounds , bank lending expands , household balance sheets improve , and state and local government budgets strengthen ?
with economic headwinds dissipating , the United States ’ prospects for faster GDP growth appear promising . but there is also a significant risk that a large and unnecessary dose of fiscal austerity will weaken demand , undermine confidence , and tip the economy back into recession .
the unemployment rate remains about two percentage points higher than what most economists consider consistent with a full recovery , and the labor-force participation rate is hovering near historic lows . the economy is still operating far below its potential : GDP is about 6 % below what the economy is capable of producing at full capacity without higher inflation .
housing prices are rising , and , while residential investment is increasing , it remains depressed as a share of GDP . households have cut their debt and rebuilt their balance sheets , but the large loss in household wealth , weak growth in wages and income , the concentration of most income gains at the top , and a decline in labor ’ s share of national income to record lows continue to constrain consumption .
confusion , fear , ideology , and electoral self-interest all play a role in the readiness of many members of Congress – despite warnings from the Federal Reserve , the Congressional Budget Office , and most private forecasters – to make such an egregious mistake .
although US federal debt is projected to rise at an unsustainable rate in the long term , the right solution is not fiscal belt-tightening now , but rather a credible plan to stabilize the debt / GDP ratio gradually as the economy recovers . indeed , as Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke recently observed , preventing a severe fiscal contraction in 2013 will boost growth , reduce the near-term deficit , and help to solve the long-term debt problem .
but what if investors lose confidence in the US government ’ s ability or willingness to tackle its long-term debt problem and begin to fear a default ( either explicit or through rapid inflation ) ? the result could be a speculative attack by “ bond-market vigilantes , ” triggering a sharp rise in interest rates , a dramatic fall in the dollar , or a combination of the two .
for three years , repeated warnings that such an attack is imminent have flown in the face of the evidence : US Treasury securities remain a safe-haven asset for global investors , including risk-sensitive foreign central banks . indeed , global investors ignored Standard &amp; amp ;
of course , Congress could spook investors and increase the likelihood of a bond-market attack by failing to raise the debt ceiling in 2013 . but , absent that monumental folly , long-term interest rates are unlikely to rise significantly as long as the Fed keeps short-term interest rates low – which it recently committed to do until unemployment falls to 6.5 % .
more than 90 % of House Republicans have signed a “ no-tax pledge . ” Other members champion the cause of a much smaller government and welcome the deep spending cuts that are scheduled to take effect in 2013 , even if they trigger a recession .
but how this motivation affects their willingness to compromise has changed as a result of redistricting and the growing polarization of voting districts along partisan lines . according to a recent analysis by Nate Silver , most House members now come from “ hyperpartisan ” districts in which the risk of losing to candidates from the other party is small .
on the contrary , especially for Republicans from districts with a strong , ideologically motivated base , voting for such deals could trigger a primary electoral challenge from within their own party . it was such self-interested Republican members who rebuffed Speaker of the House John Boehner ’ s proposal to maintain current tax rates for all but those earning more than $ 1 million per year .
the outlook for the US economy over the next few years hinges on what a deeply divided Congress decides . right now , the prospect that they will make the right choices appears to be dim .
exposing America
Washington , DC – If not for President Barack Obama ’ s bold , unexpected diplomatic breakthrough with Cuba , the last weeks of 2014 would have been relentlessly unkind to America . the deep flaws in our country ’ s justice system , the continuing racism in our society , and our government ’ s recent record of torture and abuse have been on display for the entire world to see .
then came the release by the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence of 528 pages of its report on the CIA ’ s detention and interrogation program , established following the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on America . what the committee described as an “ executive summary ” detailed horrific behavior by government officials acting on instructions from their superiors .
and our objective is to get the guys who did 9 / 11 and it is to avoid another attack against the United States . ” For their part , some current CIA officials continue to insist on the value of America ’ s “ enhanced interrogation ” program ( which Obama halted ) , despite the Senate report ’ s conclusion that the techniques it employed yielded no valuable intelligence .
from my vantage point as a US foreign-policy expert , the only bright spot in recent months has been Obama ’ s normalization of diplomatic relations with Cuba . finally , America has an opportunity to launch a new beginning , not only with Cuba but also with the Caribbean and Latin American countries that have pressed us hard and often to change our stance .
yet a common theme runs through all of these recent events , good and bad alike . in each case , US institutions and officials held other US institutions and officials to account .
Congress documented and publicized the actions of the executive branch in the torture report . Senator Dianne Feinstein worked doggedly to ensure that the Senate intelligence committee could research and document US interrogation practices , even in the face of staunch opposition by the CIA ( which even surreptitiously searched the committee ’ s computers ) .
“ There are those who will seize upon the report and say ‘ see what Americans did , ’ ” Feinstein said , “ and they will try to use it to justify evil actions or to incite more violence . we cannot prevent that .
we have no right to moralize , and we have much to learn from others . fortunately , our founding fathers gave us the exceptional gift of a political system that pushes us continually in the direction of self-correction .
the ability to correct wrongdoing can never justify doing wrong in the first place . the point of exposure is not to celebrate our ability to expose .
Obama 2.0
after a year-long campaign costing $ 2.5-6 billion ( estimates vary widely ) , President Barack Obama has won a second four-year term , with 49 states reporting their results on election night ( Florida , for the second time in four presidential elections , did not ) . Obama now has a chance to define the United States ’ role in the international system for years to come .
second terms can often be productive times for US foreign policy , largely because presidents cannot seek a third . George W. Bush , for example , used his second four years in office to fix mistakes made during his first ( his second-term team was busy ) .
presidents in their second terms often apply old-fashioned American pragmatism to tough issues , which they often cannot do during their first terms , when reelection is their first priority . Obama ’ s infamous open-mike remark to Russian Prime Minister Dimitri Medvedev that he would have more flexibility after the election may have shocked some , but , for most foreign-policy experts , he was stating the obvious .
Obama ’ s first foreign excursion after the election will be to Laos to attend the East Asian summit , a trip that is perceived as part of his administration ’ s “ pivot ” to Asia . he will also visit Myanmar ( Burma ) in an effort to lend support to that struggling country ’ s extraordinary changes and encourage further progress .
but it also needs effective communication that makes clear to the American people that the relationship with China truly is too big to fail and thus requires a long-term process of thoughtful engagement . such messages must be issued more often by the president himself , and not only by officials several bureaucratic layers below .
but no amount of fancy footwork , whether pivoting or pirouetting , can diminish that region ’ s importance . the Middle East will remain a central pillar of world energy for decades to come . &amp; # 160 ;
do the region ’ s crises stem from the lack of peace with Israel ? or is some combination of other factors – boiling frustration with the regional economic order , for example , or a US intervention that turned Sunni-led Iraq into the Arab world ’ s lonely , Shia-led black sheep – at its root ?
the Obama administration needs to do a far better job in its second term when it comes to defining the issues and setting the scope of a reenergized US diplomatic effort in the region . in Obama ’ s first term , mediators were dispatched to the region within days of his inauguration .
I suggest starting with Syria . in the absence of international leadership in forging a political end-state , Syria ’ s conflict has tragically become a sectarian civil war – one that is rapidly metastasizing , with far-reaching consequences for US interests in the region and for prior US political investments in projects like Iraq .
and among the most reliable is Europe . but Europe is preoccupied with its own economic problems , which have pressed European leadership to the breaking point .
in the meantime , the US needs to do all that it can , including showing some uncharacteristic patience , to help Europe emerge from its crisis . it also needs to continue to engage with Europe on international projects , including negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program – an issue of fundamental significance to international security .
no president in recent decades has had a better temperament and a clearer vision for facing the world ’ s challenges than the one that Americans have just reelected . Obama now has an opportunity to put that talent to work in ways that he could not in his first term .
America ’ s Sequestered Recovery
all major government functions – national security , foreign aid , basic research , emergency relief , and education , to name a few salient examples – would experience an immediate and sizeable funding hit . these cuts , along with the tax increases agreed to in January , would knock about 1.25 percentage points off 2013 GDP growth , consigning the economy to another year of tepid recovery and disappointing job gains .
the real aim of the sequester ’ s advocates is a smaller federal government – a goal that often is cloaked in the argument that excessive government spending is choking economic growth . although this is a politically compelling argument , because it stokes public fears about an out-of-control deficit , it flies in the face of the facts .
anemic government spending , not profligacy , has been a major factor behind the economy ’ s lackluster recovery . according to a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office , large spending cuts by state and local governments – and , more recently , a significant reduction in federal spending – have contributed to the unusual and prolonged weakness of aggregate demand .
in recent speeches , US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Vice Chair Janet Yellen have described fiscal policy at the local , state , and federal levels as a powerful headwind slowing the economy ’ s return to full employment . in the year after the recession ended , discretionary spending at the federal , state , and local levels boosted growth at about the same pace as in previous recoveries .
state and local governments have cut spending and payrolls significantly . and federal purchases of goods and services have been declining since 2010 , when the temporary additional spending in the 2009 stimulus package came to an end .
even without the sequester , real per capita government spending ( including both purchases and transfer payments ) has declined under President Barack Obama , while it increased under every preceding president since Richard Nixon . ( indeed , per capita spending growth was much faster under the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush than it was under Democratic Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton . )
as a result of a deep and persistent deficiency in aggregate demand , the US economy has been operating far below its potential output level . real GDP fell by 8 % relative to its noninflationary potential in 2008-2009 , and has remained about 8 % below its previous growth path ever since .
the significant loss of current and future potential output is all the more remarkable , because it has occurred despite a sustained and unprecedented effort by the Fed to boost demand and hasten the recovery . Fed officials have repeatedly expressed concern that the prolonged weak recovery will inflict future pain in the form of slower long-run growth .
recent research has found that the multiplier for discretionary fiscal policy – the change in output caused by a change in discretionary government spending – is larger when nominal interest rates are low and there is a significant amount of underutilized resources . these conditions describe the US economy as it faces yet another round of government spending cuts that would have negative multiplier effects on GDP and job growth .
indeed , these effects are likely to be larger than expected compared to conventional multiplier estimates , which rest on two assumptions : the economy is close to full employment ; and the contraction in demand caused by a cut in government spending will be offset by a drop in interest rates . neither assumption applies today .
even worse , the sequester ’ s across-the-board spending cuts make no distinction between effective and essential programs and programs that represent special interests or have outlived their original purpose . such arbitrary cuts are likely to inflict more damage on the economy than sensibly targeted cuts of the same magnitude .
it has no economic justification . in the long run , additional targeted spending cuts will be necessary as part of a balanced package to stabilize the debt / GDP ratio .
the Single-Engine Global Economy
Tokyo – The global economy is like a jetliner that needs all of its engines operational to take off and steer clear of clouds and storms . unfortunately , only one of its four engines is functioning properly : the Anglosphere ( the United States and its close cousin , the United Kingdom ) .
likewise , the third engine , Japan , is running out of fuel after a year of fiscal and monetary stimulus . and emerging markets ( the fourth engine ) are slowing sharply as decade-long global tailwinds – rapid Chinese growth , zero policy rates and quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve , and a commodity super-cycle – become headwinds .
weakness in the rest of the world implies a stronger dollar , which will invariably weaken US growth . the deeper the slowdown in other countries and the higher the dollar rises , the less the US will be able to decouple from the funk everywhere else , even if domestic demand seems robust .
falling oil prices may provide cheaper energy for manufacturers and households , but they hurt energy exporters and their spending . and , while increased supply – particularly from North American shale resources – has put downward pressure on prices , so has weaker demand in the eurozone , Japan , China , and many emerging markets .
bad macro news can be good for markets , because a prompt policy response alone can boost asset prices . but recent bad macro news has been bad for markets , owing to the perception of policy inertia .
as for fiscal policy , Germany continues to resist a much-needed stimulus to boost eurozone demand . and Japan seems to be intent on inflicting on itself a second , growth-retarding consumption-tax increase .
furthermore , the Fed has now exited quantitative easing and is showing a willingness to start raising policy rates sooner than markets expected . if the Fed does not postpone rate increases until the global economic weather clears , it risks an aborted takeoff – the fate of many economies in the last few years .
if the Republican Party takes full control of the US Congress in November ’ s mid-term election , policy gridlock is likely to worsen , risking a re-run of the damaging fiscal battles that led last year to a government shutdown and almost to a technical debt default . more broadly , the gridlock will prevent the passage of important structural reforms that the US needs to boost growth .
the biggest , China , is in the midst of a structural slowdown that will push its growth rate closer to 5 % in the next two years , from above 7 % now . at the same time , much-touted reforms to rebalance growth from fixed investment to consumption are being postponed until President Xi Jinping consolidates his power .
the risk of a global crash has been low , because deleveraging has proceeded apace in most advanced economies ; the effects of fiscal drag are smaller ; monetary policies remain accommodative ; and asset reflation has had positive wealth effects . moreover , many emerging-market countries are still growing robustly , maintain sound macroeconomic policies , and are starting to implement growth-enhancing structural reforms .
private and public debts in advanced economies are still high and rising – and are potentially unsustainable , especially in the eurozone and Japan . rising inequality is redistributing income to those with a high propensity to save ( the rich and corporations ) , and is exacerbated by capital-intensive , labor-saving technological innovation .
this combination of high debt and rising inequality may be the source of the secular stagnation that is making structural reforms more politically difficult to implement . if anything , the rise of nationalistic , populist , and nativist parties in Europe , North America , and Asia is leading to a backlash against free trade and labor migration , which could further weaken global growth .
rather than boosting credit to the real economy , unconventional monetary policies have mostly lifted the wealth of the very rich – the main beneficiaries of asset reflation . but now reflation may be creating asset-price bubbles , and the hope that macro-prudential policies will prevent them from bursting is so far just that – a leap of faith .
fortunately , rising geopolitical risks – a Middle East on fire , the Russia-Ukraine conflict , Hong Kong ’ s turmoil , and China ’ s territorial disputes with its neighbors – together with geo-economic threats from , say , Ebola and global climate change , have not yet led to financial contagion . nonetheless , they are slowing down capital spending and consumption , given the option value of waiting during uncertain times .
so the global economy is flying on a single engine , the pilots must navigate menacing storm clouds , and fights are breaking out among the passengers . if only there were emergency crews on the ground .

Berkeley – The story goes like this : since 1979 – the peak of the last business cycle before the inauguration of Ronald Reagan as President – economic growth in the United States has been overwhelmingly a rich-only phenomenon . real ( inflation-adjusted ) wages , incomes , and living standards for America ’ s poor and middle-class households are at best only trivially higher .
one is found in the Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes , published by the US Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) last year . after-tax real income for the lowest quintile of US households was 49 % higher in 2010 than in 1979 , growing at an average rate of 1.3 % annually .
but real income gains of 1.3 % per year for the middle quintiles and 1.1 % for the bottom are not exactly chopped liver , are they ? the gap with 1.6 % average annual growth rate for per capita GDP is small , isn ’ t it ?
well , yes and no . an optimist ( or an apologist ) could argue that , though market income has indeed become grossly more unequal since 1979 , with the slots in the bottom half of the income distribution losing absolute ground in real income , and with taxation becoming less progressive , welfare-state growth substantially moderated this increase in inequality .
but when one looks at the 1.3 % annual growth rate of after-tax real income that the CBO calculates for the bottom quintile , 0.9 percentage points comes from the growth of the health-care financing programs Medicare , Medicaid , and the State Children ’ s Health Insurance Program . the CBO counts all of that growth as an increase in poor US households ’ after-tax real income .
moreover , only half of those expenditures show up as more health care received by program beneficiaries ; the other half flow into the general US health-care financing system and cover care that was previously uncompensated . and America ’ s health-care financing system is uniquely inefficient : other OECD countries get more in terms of health and healthcare services from every dollar they spend than America gets from every $ 2 it spends .
hence the necessity of something like the individual health-insurance mandate of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( “ Obamacare ” ) , or of biting the bullet and adopting a single-payer system for financing health care . either way , America needs to gets something comparable to other OECD countries ’ value out of its enormous health-care expenditures .
on even days , however , my bottom line is very different . America ’ s poor in 1979 lagged so far behind normal OECD social democracies in terms of health and health care that even though each extra dollar produced only $ 0.25 of real health-care services , that $ 0.25 was worth about one dollar to the poor in terms of material wellbeing .
on this reading , the expansion of America ’ s health-care programs has kept the properly measured material wellbeing of its poor on an upward path since 1979 at a rate not much less than that of real per capita GDP . but the health-care coverage and financing gaps that existed in America in 1979 made it a much more unequal place than the income-distribution data showed .
the Great Democracies ’ New Harmony
Cambridge – When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited US President Barack Obama to attend his country ’ s Republic Day ceremonies earlier this year , it signaled an important change in relations between the world ’ s two biggest democracies . ever since the 1990s , three American administrations have tried to improve bilateral relations , with mixed results .
the two countries have a long history of confusing each other . by definition , any alliance with a superpower is unequal ; so efforts to establish close ties with the United States have long run up against India ’ s tradition of strategic autonomy .
the most important factor is the acceleration in India ’ s economic growth , which the International Monetary Fund projects will exceed 7.5 % through 2020 . for decades , India suffered from what some called the “ Hindu rate of economic growth ” : a little more than 1 % per year .
market-oriented reforms in the early 1990s changed that pattern , and annual growth accelerated to 7 % under the Congress party , before slumping to 5 % . since the 2014 general election brought Modi ’ s Bharatiya Janata Party to power , the government has reversed the slowdown .
India has an emerging middle class of several hundred million , and English is an official language spoken by some 50 to 100 million . building on that base , Indian information industries are able to play a major global role .
moreover , with a population of 1.2 billion people , India is four times larger than the US , and likely to surpass China by 2025 . its sheer scale will be increasingly important not only to the global economy , but also to balancing China ’ s influence in Asia and managing global issues such as climate change , public health , and cyber security .
India also has significant military power , with an estimated 90-100 nuclear weapons , intermediate-range missiles , 1.3 million military personnel , and annual military expenditure of nearly $ 50 billion ( 3 % of the world total ) . and , in terms of soft power , India has an established democracy , an influential diaspora , and a vibrant popular culture with transnational influence .
population alone is not a source of power unless those human resources are developed , and India has lagged well behind China in terms of literacy and economic growth . despite its progress , around a third of India ’ s population lives in conditions of acute poverty , making the country home to a third of the world ’ s poor .
even more striking , while 95 % of the Chinese population is literate , the proportion for India is only 74 % – and only 65 % for women . a symptom of this problem is India ’ s poor performance in international comparisons of universities , with none ranked among the world ’ s top 100 .
India is unlikely to develop the power to become a global challenger to the US in the first half of this century . indeed , even in terms of soft power , a recent study by the Portland Consultancy in London placed India outside the top 30 countries .
nonetheless , India has considerable assets that already affect the balance of power in Asia . while India and China signed agreements in 1993 and 1996 that promised a peaceful settlement of the border dispute that led them to war in l962 , the issue has heated up again , following Chinese actions in recent years .
while Indian officials are often discreet in public about relations with China , and wisely want bilateral trade and investment to grow , their security concerns remain acute . as part of the group of Asian countries that will tend to balance China , India has already begun to strengthen its diplomatic relations with Japan .
Indian economic success is an American interest on its own . so is the open approach taken by India and Brazil on issues such as governance of the Internet , at a time when Russia and China are seeking more authoritarian control .
no one should expect an Indian-American alliance any time soon , given historical Indian public opinion . but one can predict a relationship in the coming years that will be both sui generis and stronger .
a Marshall Plan for the United States
new YORK – When a major highway bridge in California collapsed last month , the impact on the entire southwestern United States once again highlighted the country ’ s serious infrastructure problem . indeed , in a sense , the world ’ s largest economy is falling apart .
ideological aversion to public-sector investment , together with the endemic short-term thinking of those who write budgets , has kept spending on roads , airports , railways , telecommunication networks , and power generation at levels far below what is needed . and yet the problem can no longer be ignored .
a 2013 report by the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the US a pathetic overall grade of D + for its infrastructure . the report cited numerous state-specific shortcomings , including Michigan ’ s “ 88 high-hazard dams and 1,298 structurally deficient bridges ” and the “ $ 44.5 billion needed to upgrade drinking-water systems ” in California .
the report concludes that a $ 3.6 trillion investment ( roughly one-fifth of the country ’ s annual GDP ) will be needed by 2020 to boost the quality of US infrastructure by addressing the “ significant backlog of overdue maintenance &#91; and the &#93; pressing need for modernization . ” Otherwise , the country ’ s crumbling infrastructure will drag down economic growth for years to come .
America ’ s desperate need for modern infrastructure has come , in some ways , at a fortuitous moment . at a time when the economic recovery remains fragile , a publicly financed infrastructure program could meaningfully transform the prospects of US workers , providing new employment opportunities for low and un-skilled labor .
pension funds , insurance companies , and mutual funds in the US manage combined assets totaling roughly $ 30 trillion , and they have been struggling to find investments that match their long-term obligations . persistently low interest rates have been particularly challenging for pension funds , which face rising liabilities ( calculated on a discounted basis ) .
sadly , ideological objections and partisan politics are likely to strew obstacles in the path of any effort to modernize America ’ s infrastructure and create such opportunities at home . public-sector investment invariably rekindles the age-old struggle between those who insist that government should stay out of efforts to create jobs and those who believe that part of government ’ s role is to put underutilized human resources to work .
this would operate much like the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform , established in 2010 to address America ’ s fiscal challenges , or the military-base-closing commissions of the 1980s and 1990s . by splitting the responsibility between the country ’ s two main parties , the commission would free its members from the pressures of day-to-day politics and allow them to concentrate on the health of the economy .
infrastructure has long been acknowledged as fundamental to a country ’ s economic prospects . in neglecting the necessary investments , the US has put itself on a precarious path , one that could lead to stagnation and decline , which would be difficult to reverse .
low interest rates , the dollar ’ s continuing role as the world ’ s main reserve currency , and the capacity of the public sector to increase spending make the case for higher infrastructure spending compelling . in the twentieth century , the US government spent billions of dollars to rebuild the European economy .

India ’ s Data of Discrimination
new DELHI – Last December ’ s fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi triggered an unprecedented public outcry in India . tens of thousands of citizens took to the streets to demand an end to police indifference to women ’ s safety , stronger laws , and speedier trials for those charged with crimes against women .
the commission ’ s roughly 700-page report , completed in only 29 days , urged the government to take swift , far-reaching action . among the report ’ s recommendations were stronger penalties for sex crimes , including harassment ; a requirement that police officers report every instance of alleged rape ; and broader measures to address pervasive discrimination against women .
India ’ s government responded two weeks later , announcing a new ordinance that not only expands the definition of rape , but also makes behavior such as groping , stalking , trafficking , and voyeurism serious criminal offenses . but , as the commission ’ s report highlighted , India does not lack laws intended to deter sexual violence against women .
the recent explosion of long-dormant public outrage should be a tipping point , precipitating genuine progress toward a more equal society . but designing effective policies to diminish the obstacles confronting women and girls requires measuring the prevalence of the attitudes and habits that limit their potential .
indeed , India is a complex amalgam of 28 states with widely varying social indicators . for example , the nine states that the government has labeled “ high focus ” account for 62 % of India ’ s maternal deaths and 70 % of infant deaths , but contain only 48 % of the country ’ s population .
women comprise just 10 % of India ’ s parliament , and only two of 35 ministers with full Cabinet rank are women . and , while the 33 % quota for women in local-government bodies has placed a million of them in elected positions at the grass roots , the extent to which this has actually improved women ’ s status has yet to be measured .
moreover , in the same region , more than 60 % of girls are married well before the legal age , making pregnancies among anemic and malnourished teenagers a common occurrence . but , at the same time , most girls complete 12 years of schooling in the northern mountain state of Himachal Pradesh , demonstrating that the north-south distinction is no more conclusive than countrywide generalizations .
to facilitate the design of effective targeted policies , India ’ s Central Statistical Organization is working to provide detailed data through a pilot project that captures Indian states ’ SIGI indicators . the study will highlight the variations in social , cultural , and economic barriers to female empowerment across India .
policies based on generalities will not work . to initiate a fundamental shift in citizens ’ gender-related attitudes and behavior , India ’ s leaders must understand – by the numbers – the often-dramatic disparities between their country ’ s individual states .
slow Growth for US Interest Rates
London – The US Federal Reserve ’ s new policy statement will , as usual , be analyzed in excruciating detail in the days ahead , as investors seek guidance on when and how quickly interest rates will be raised . notably , the word “ patient ” does not appear , and the Fed has signaled that it may raise its benchmark rate as early as June .
in fact , uncertainty about monetary policy in the United States has been the leading driver of financial-market volatility this year . after all , the potential effect of interest-rate hikes on the US yield curve has a major impact on the pricing of all global assets .
but three factors suggest that investors are over-emphasizing the risk of a curve re-pricing . first , economic developments will likely lead the Fed to exhibit caution when it comes to the process of raising interest rates .
the consensus nowadays is that the US economy is growing steadily , with the leading indicators pointing toward further expansion , and labor-market data surpassing expectations . job creation is strong , with total non-farm payroll employment having increased by 295,000 in February and the unemployment rate falling yet again , to just 5.5 % .
the core consumer price index , to be released next week , is expected to show a year-on-year increase of just 1.7 % – or even less , if the lower oil price feeds through from headline to core CPI . and real wage growth stands at less than 2 % , which is below the level deemed necessary by the Fed to underpin a sustainable acceleration in consumer spending .
on top of already modest inflation expectations – characterized by a five-year break-even inflation rate of 1.9 % – the dollar has appreciated by around 10 % this year , and by almost 25 % since the beginning of last year . given the deflationary impact of a stronger currency – and the Fed ’ s general intolerance of deflation – there is good reason to believe that the Fed will exercise caution in raising interest rates .
even if the Fed ignores deflationary pressure and hikes interest rates more quickly , medium- and long-term rates are still likely to be anchored , given how little yield is available elsewhere in the world . yields on German Bunds are now negative out to eight years .
lending to the emerging economies is hardly attractive , either , with even the riskiest economies offering low hard-currency yields . indeed , even Russia – whose military intervention in Ukraine has led the West to impose strict economic sanctions – offers annual yield of less than 6 % on ten-year bonds .
given such low yields in most of the world , investors will be eager to take advantage of the relative value opportunity offered by rising US interest rates . add to that America ’ s safe-haven status , and the fact that any re-pricing of US rates surely would reflect an economic resurgence , and the bid for US Treasuries should be exceptionally strong .
though US monetary policy undoubtedly exerts significant influence on global markets , fears surrounding the direction of US interest rates may be overdone . though the Fed may no longer be promising patience , the current financial environment implies that investors should not , for the time being , anticipate a major hike .
America in the Way
the conference came at a time when developing countries and emerging markets have demonstrated their ability to absorb huge amounts of money productively . indeed , the tasks that these countries are undertaking – investing in infrastructure ( roads , electricity , ports , and much else ) , building cities that will one day be home to billions , and moving toward a green economy – are truly enormous .
that remains true today . the problem , then as now , is that the world ’ s financial markets , meant to intermediate efficiently between savings and investment opportunities , instead misallocate capital and create risk .
most of the investment projects that the emerging world needs are long term , as are much of the available savings – the trillions in retirement accounts , pension funds , and sovereign wealth funds . but our increasingly shortsighted financial markets stand between the two .
back then , the G-7 dominated global economic policymaking ; today , China is the world ’ s largest economy ( in purchasing-power-parity terms ) , with savings some 50 % larger than that of the US . in 2002 , Western financial institutions were thought to be wizards at managing risk and allocating capital ; today , we see that they are wizards at market manipulation and other deceptive practices .
gone are the calls for the developed countries to live up to their commitment to give at least 0.7 % of their GNI in development aid . a few northern European countries – Denmark , Luxembourg , Norway , Sweden and , most surprisingly , the United Kingdom – in the midst of its self-inflicted austerity – fulfilled their pledges in 2014 .
today , developing countries and emerging markets say to the US and others : if you will not live up to your promises , at least get out of the way and let us create an international architecture for a global economy that works for the poor , too . not surprisingly , the existing hegemons , led by the US , are doing whatever they can to thwart such efforts .
Ukraine , Greece , and Argentina are all examples of the failure of existing international arrangements . the vast majority of countries have called for the creation of a framework for sovereign-debt restructuring .
private investment is important , too . but the new investment provisions embedded in the trade agreements that the Obama administration is negotiating across both oceans imply that accompanying any such foreign direct investment comes a marked reduction in governments ’ abilities to regulate the environment , health , working conditions , and even the economy .
as developing countries and emerging markets open themselves to multinationals , it becomes increasingly important that they can tax these behemoths on the profits generated by the business that occurs within their borders . Apple , Google , and General Electric have demonstrated a genius for avoiding taxes that exceeds what they employed in creating innovative products .
last year , the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists released information about Luxembourg ’ s tax rulings that exposed the scale of tax avoidance and evasion . while a rich country like the US arguably can afford the behavior described in the so-called Luxembourg Leaks , the poor cannot .
in a report presented to the International Conference on Financing for Development , we unanimously agreed that the current system is broken , and that minor tweaks will not fix it . we proposed an alternative – similar to the way corporations are taxed within the US , with profits allocated to each state on the basis of the economic activity occurring within state borders .
the US and other advanced countries have been pushing for much smaller changes , to be recommended by the OECD , the advanced countries ’ club . in other words , the countries from which the politically powerful tax evaders and avoiders come are supposed to design a system to reduce tax evasion .
developing countries and emerging markets , led by India , argued that the proper forum for discussing such global issues was an already established group within the United Nations , the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters , whose status and funding needed to be elevated . the US strongly opposed : it wanted to keep things the same as in the past , with global governance by and for the advanced countries .
new geopolitical realities demand new forms of global governance , with a greater voice for developing and emerging countries . the US prevailed in Addis , but it also showed itself to be on the wrong side of history .
the Decline of US Military Innovation
America ’ s armed forces may still be the most advanced in the world ; after all , the US spends more than twice as much on military research and development as major powers like France and Russia , and nine times more than China and Germany . but America ’ s continued technological leadership is far from assured .
the move , which requires reduced spending in numerous programs , including many defense research initiatives , was described by US President Barack Obama ’ s administration as “ deeply destructive to national security . ” If US defense innovation continues to erode , not only will America ’ s defense capabilities suffer ; the country will also risk slipping in terms of commercial innovation and competitiveness .
the Navy ’ s research budget has been cut by some 20 % , and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) – the organization tasked with keeping the US military ahead of the technological curve – has had to slash R &amp; amp ; D spending by 18 % . even the Air Force , where research spending has traditionally been a congressional priority , has been forced to cut its budget by roughly 4 % .
when money does get allocated , cost pressures too often encourage investment in projects that promise quick results – a bias that comes at the expense of long-term innovation that could provide a strategic advantage . even DARPA has fallen prey to pressure for research that can demonstrate immediate progress .
six decades of attempts to reform the defense acquisition process have yet to yield fruit . most of the design , development , and production of military systems is carried out by civilian industry , but decision-making remains firmly in the hands of military officials , who may not be able to strike the right balance between cost-cutting and innovation .
rivalries within and among the military services once mimicked the role of competition in the private sector : they drove innovation . but with the end of the Cold War , the pressure to remain a step ahead has waned , depriving the defense sector of a crucial engine of progress .
increased competition from China and other large emerging economies has eroded US manufacturing capabilities , jeopardizing America ’ s ability to develop the most technologically sophisticated defense platforms . the defense industry once created the new technologies – lasers , GPS , and the Internet , for example – that helped drive the American economy .
the result can be seen in the rise of foreign competition in the international arms market . American manufacturers are finding themselves increasingly vulnerable in areas that they once dominated – including unmanned aerial platforms , intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance , missiles , and satellites – as low-cost competitors gain market share .
“ Continued fiscal pressure will likely limit our military ’ s ability to respond to long-term challenges by increasing the size of our force or simply outspending potential adversaries on current systems , ” he said . “ So to overcome challenges to our military superiority , we must change the way we innovate , operate , and do business . ”
a policy aimed at restoring defense innovation and production in America would ensure that the US upholds its global technological leadership and commercial competitiveness . unfortunately , Hagel ’ s successor is likely to find that , in an era of limited budgets and automatic spending cuts , the type of comprehensive innovation strategy that Hagel envisioned may simply not be viable .
fixing America ’ s Fiscal Problem
Cambridge – With America ’ s elections less than six weeks away , it is time to think seriously about what will be done afterwards to deal with the nation ’ s fiscal mess . regardless of who wins , addressing the problem can no longer be postponed .
Americans are rightly focused on the “ fiscal cliff ” looming at the start of 2013 , when , under current legislation , virtually all tax rates will rise , sucking more than 3 % of GDP out of households and businesses . in addition , automatic cuts in government spending on defense and non-defense programs will subtract nearly another 1 % of GDP in 2013 and similar amounts in future years .
the challenge facing US politicians after the election will be to find a politically acceptable way to raise that revenue without undermining incentives and economic growth . the task is made more complex by the large number of legislators who insist that the deficit should be reduced by spending cuts alone .
although no one can be sure how this complex problem will be solved , here is my best guess : soon after the election , the US Congress will vote to postpone the fiscal cliff for about six months to allow time to work out an acceptable legislative solution . that solution will involve slowing the growth of Social Security pension benefits for future middle- and upper-income retirees .
and if I buy a bigger home or just increase the size of my mortgage , I receive a larger deduction that reduces my taxable income , lowering my tax bill . while the government is not giving me money , these special targeted tax breaks are no less “ government spending ” than they would be if the government sent me a check .
these features are rightly called “ tax expenditures , ” because they describe the government spending that occurs through the tax code . eliminating or reducing these tax expenditures should therefore be seen as cutting government spending .
so the key to raising revenue is to reduce tax expenditures , use some of the resulting revenue to reduce tax rates , and devote the rest to reducing future deficits . opponents of tax increases should see that , because such revenue-raising is really cutting government spending , it does not imply the adverse incentive effects of raising marginal tax rates .
but even if the intellectual objection to extra revenue can be overcome in this way , the practical political problem is that every large tax expenditure – the home mortgage interest deduction , the exclusion of employer payments for health insurance , etc . – has its fervent defenders .
so here is an idea that might work politically : let taxpayers keep all of the current tax expenditures , but limit the total amount by which each taxpayer can reduce his or her tax liability in this way .
applying a 2 % -of-AGI cap to the total benefit that an individual can receive from tax expenditures would have a very powerful effect . it would not limit the amount of deductions and exclusions to 2 % of AGI , but rather would limit the resulting tax reduction – that is , the tax benefit – that the individual gets by using all these special features .
such a cap would have a significant impact on the fiscal outlook . even if the cap were applied only to “ itemized deductions ” and the health-insurance exclusion , it would raise about $ 250 billion in the first year and about $ 3 trillion over the first decade .
the cap rate could be higher , or it could start higher and be gradually tightened , or it could vary with an individual ’ s income level . but the economic and political attractiveness of a cap consists in its ability to raise substantial revenue without eliminating specific tax expenditures .
fixing America ’ s fiscal problem will be as difficult as it is important . but slowing the growth of Social Security benefits and capping total tax expenditures would be a good framework for the coming reform .
why is Obama Winning ?
incumbents win if the economic outlook is rosy , and are vulnerable – as George H. W. Bush was – when times are hard . indeed , throughout Europe – in France , Greece , Ireland , Portugal , Spain , and the United Kingdom – governments have been turned out of office in the face of a crisis that they have seemed unable to address .
according to United States Census data , household income fell in 2011 for the fourth consecutive year . unemployment remains persistently high , despite the $ 787 billion stimulus package in 2009 , and house prices , though recovering slowly , remain far below their pre-2008 peak .
one reason is that there is no reliable way to render an instant judgment about economic effectiveness , and the legacy that Obama inherited – coming to office in the middle of a major economic and financial catastrophe – clearly matters . President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Gordon Brown are obviously more responsible for the financial crisis than are their successors , who have to clean up the mess .
moreover , as Zhou Enlai memorably responded when Henry Kissinger asked him about the effects of the French Revolution , “ It is too early to tell ” ( though Zhou apparently thought he was being asked about the consequences of the 1968 Paris student uprising ) . tracing the precise consequences of policy measures or institutional reforms – &amp; # 160 ; and estimating when they might “ pay off ” – is hopelessly complex .
the long-term success of the economy , and its capacity to build wealth and jobs , depends on productivity gains , which in turn depend on technical and organizational innovation . governments cannot just conjure that up by waving a magic wand .
but governments can influence the development of productivity . and this is where legitimate debate begins , because immediate action to save jobs does not necessarily help .
the wrong kind of stimulus may get in the way of future productivity growth by channeling workers into the wrong kind of employment ( or keeping them there ) . large-scale public projects , particularly when they are aimed simply at putting as many people as possible quickly back to work , will lead to a shortage of labor available for more productive jobs .
John Maynard Keynes and his disciples pushed the idea that even apparently useless projects , such as pyramid construction in ancient Egypt , made sense . Keynes ’ s Cambridge disciple , Joan Robinson , was particularly worried because Hitler seemed to have grasped this point more quickly than democratic governments had .
in fact , increased spending , which the Keynesians saw simply as boosting aggregate demand , produced distortions . under Hitler , the German economy in the 1930 ’ s shifted to a lower-productivity mechanism in order to churn out armaments and shoddy manufactured goods , neither of which would have any use in a market economy .
such misallocation of resources was not just a menace of the interwar period . the big pre-2008 construction boom in Spain did as much harm as subsequent high unemployment , because it encouraged a generation of young people to take high-paying , low-skill jobs in the building industry .
but simply permitting the crisis to continue is a terrible option . a severe and long-lasting episode of large-scale unemployment is devastating , because it erodes an economy ’ s skill base , undermines human potential , and affronts human dignity .
but the answer to that question is not why the pundits are cheering Obama . they are cheering because financial markets are cheering , following the Federal Reserve ’ s recent announcement of further stimulus .
asset prices create a large “ wealth effect ” that determines how financially well off people feel . with many Americans anxiously monitoring the monthly performance of their private pension plans , the only economic statistic that matters is that the S &amp; amp ; P 500 has returned to its pre-2008 level .
as a result , the lesson about the economy ’ s electoral salience is being subtly reformulated . it is no longer the real state of the economy , but rather the perception of asset markets , that is crucial .
in America , the Federal Reserve is bound to become much more politicized as a result . Republicans will blame their defeat in November on the Fed ’ s monetary stimulus ( if not on the ineffectiveness of Mitt Romney ’ s blunder-filled campaign ) .
meanwhile , in Europe , many national leaders , looking at Obama and the Fed , may conclude that they would do better with more direct control over the central bank . given the difficulty of establishing such control over the European Central Bank , the euro ’ s next great challenge may be growing sentiment in favor of a return to national currencies .
America ’ s Why Not Election
it doesn ’ t make sense . the 2016 race is shaping up as the weirdest in modern times , owing not just to the number of candidates – currently 14 , with two or three more expected to announce soon – but also to the unusual nature of many of them .
a failed presidential campaign , even a disastrous one , can lead to higher speaking fees , richer book contracts , or a television gig . Newt Gingrich and Mike Huckabee both failed to win the Republican nomination , but secured seats on cable talk shows .
the answer is yes – in the sense that anything is possible . nobody I know thinks she is likely to stumble so badly ; still , the Clintons are known to be accident-prone , and they have been full of surprises – scandals and scandalettes – since they first appeared on the national scene a quarter-century ago .
Bernie Sanders , a self-described socialist , inspires enthusiasm . Sanders is riding the leftist wave in Democratic politics , and while many of his proposals may not be able to stand up against hard questioning ( how , for example , would he fund his plan to make college tuition free for everyone ? ) , he has so far managed to avoid any serious challenge to them .
she seems packaged and cautious , slow to get around to a position on some key issues , such as trade , that divide Democrats . for the moment , however , nobody can predict whether Sanders will be able to convert the impressive crowds he has been drawing into electoral strength , or even how long he will remain in fashion .
the latest entry into the Democratic race , Jim Webb – who has served as Assistant Secretary of Defense , Secretary of the Navy , and Senator from Virginia – has talent , but lacks steadiness . Martin O ’ Malley , the former governor of Maryland , has promise , but has yet to catch on .
will he prove nimble enough to maneuver through the Republican nominating process , given that its early stages are heavily tilted to the right ? evangelical Christians play a crucial role in the Iowa caucuses , the first contest in the quest for the nomination , but putting too much effort into pleasing them can make a candidate unelectable .
Bush ’ s interest in running was enough to convince Mitt Romney , who lost the 2012 election to Barack Obama , not to try a third time . but even the supposedly formidable Bush name was not enough to convince younger , scrappier candidates to step aside .
ambitious young pols like Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker currently are viewed as Bush ’ s strongest rivals , but both will be facing increased scrutiny and testing . Rand Paul enjoyed a period of buzz , but that seems to have faded , as his dovish brand of libertarianism clashes with a party that leans toward social conservatism and interventionism abroad .
I seem to have been one of the few journalists who from the outset didn ’ t think that Donald Trump ’ s entry into the presidential race was funny . Trump is not remotely qualified to be president , but he is no joke .
they ’ re rapists . and some , I assume , are good people . ” – sent his popularity soaring , to the mortification of many Republican leaders .
those leaders have good reason to be panicked by Trump &apos;s rise : they know that if they can ’ t find a way to attract more Hispanic voters than Romney did in 2012 , they will have a poor chance of winning the presidency . Trump ’ s comments may have cost him some of his commercial ties , but anyone who thinks he doesn ’ t know what he ’ s doing should think again .
one of the more bizarre aspects of this election is the success of Ben Carson , a retired neurosurgeon and political neophyte . his extreme views on homosexuality – he has likened it to bestiality and claimed that spending time in prison makes people gay – has resonated with a swath of the Republican electorate , making him a real contender in Iowa .
the 2016 presidential election campaign not only has more candidates than ever ; it also has the highest proportion in memory who are flat-out unqualified for the job . and some of them are doing very well at this point .
foreign Policy and America ’ s Presidential Campaign
new YORK – It is impossible to know whom American voters will choose as their next president . but it is certain that the choice will have profound consequences , for better and for worse , for the entire world .
it also reflects the near-certainty that the next president will inherit a world in considerable turmoil . what he or she chooses to do , and how he or she chooses to do it , will matter a great deal to people everywhere .
that said , it is difficult to know what role foreign policy will play in determining who will next occupy the Oval Office . the 2016 election is still 17 months away .
former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the Democratic frontrunner , though her nomination is not a foregone conclusion . in any case , foreign policy probably will play little role in the decision , as the issues that most concern voters likely to participate in the Democratic primary elections are domestic and economic in nature .
the Republican side is far more crowded and uncertain , and it seems far likelier that foreign policy will play a large role in choosing the party ’ s nominee . the economy is improving under President Barack Obama , making it a less attractive political target .
Obama is seeking Trade Promotion Authority , a necessary prelude to gaining congressional support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership , which would reduce barriers between the US and 11 other Pacific Rim countries . many – but not all – of the Republican candidates back the TPP ; the politics on the Democratic side is more hostile to the deal , making it potentially risky for any Democratic candidate to support it .
questions will be raised about which sanctions are to be eased and when ; about the terms of compliance inspections ; and about what will happen once some of the limits on Iran ’ s nuclear activities expire . democratic candidates are more likely to be sympathetic to whatever is negotiated ; but there are certain to be differences among candidates on both sides .
likewise , planning for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December will keep the issue in the news . Democrats will be more supportive of more far-reaching US commitments , although , again , differences of view will emerge on both sides .
there is little appetite on either side for large-scale military intervention in Iraq and Syria to counter the Islamic State . but there will be heated debate – and considerable posturing – over what should and should not be done .
then there are all the other issues , from Chinese assertiveness in Asia to Russian revanchism in Ukraine . the rhetoric , especially on the Republican side , will be muscular .
one hopes that what emerges from the parties ’ nominating processes is insight into how the successful candidates answer three big questions .
if one thinks of national security as two sides of a coin , with foreign policy on one side and domestic policy on the other , how likely is each to land face up for the next president ? this is the classic “ guns versus butter ” debate over how resources , from dollars to presidential attention , should be allocated .
the realist tradition in international relations focuses on influencing other countries ’ foreign policies and places less emphasis on their internal affairs . the main alternative tradition takes the opposite tack , arguing that other countries ’ domestic affairs are what matter most , whether for reasons of morality and principle , or because it is believed that how a government behaves at home affects how it acts abroad .
according to this idealist view , countries that are democratic and treat their citizens with respect are more likely to treat other countries ’ citizens with respect . the problem , of course , is that affecting the trajectories of other societies is typically a difficult , long-term proposition ; in the meantime , there are pressing global challenges that need to be addressed , sometimes with the assistance of unsavory regimes .
the last question concerns the nominees ’ approach to the execution of foreign policy . what will be their preferred mix of unilateralism and multilateralism , and which tools – from diplomacy and sanctions to intelligence operations and military force – will they reach for most often ?
the answers to these questions should become clearer during the campaign .
the Not-Ready-for-Prime-Time Republicans
Washington , DC – Shortly after America &apos;s Republican Party trounced the Democrats and gained control of the Senate in last November &apos;s midterm congressional elections , Mitch McConnell , the new Senate majority leader , appealed to his colleagues not to be “ scary , &quot; but to be “ positive &quot; and effective . this has proved very difficult .
he knows that , if the Republicans are to win back the presidency in 2016 , they must prove their ability to govern responsibly . he also recognizes that the Republicans would otherwise find it much more difficult to hold onto the Senate in the next election , when more swing-state seats are in play .
with this in mind , McConnell decided that continuing to block President Barack Obama &apos;s initiatives , as the Republicans had done during the previous six years , could no longer work . so he promised that his party would try to compromise on a few issues , and offered an explicit pledge that there would be no government shutdowns like the highly unpopular one in 2013 .
meanwhile , many Democrats view their new minority status as a source of relief , as it has removed the pressure to deliver results or obey their party &apos;s leaders . even Obama seems to feel liberated , proposing popular programs – for example , free tuition at two-year community colleges and a minimum-wage increase – that he knows the Republicans will reject , thereby upholding their reputation as the “ party of no . &quot;
the Republicans eschew anything that enhances the role of the federal government , unless they consider it to be essential to national security ( the party of personal liberty supports warrantless wiretapping , for example ) . the Democrats , by contrast , support a more active federal role in setting national standards and ensuring that the benefits of public programs are distributed fairly .
though the movement &apos;s ranks have thinned somewhat , its adherents continue to exert considerable influence in Congress . it has powerful and well-funded backers , including the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch .
despite the desire of party leaders to boost trust in a Republican-led government , many Republicans care little about the effect of their behavior on their party &apos;s prospects of winning back the White House . indeed , the party &apos;s agenda remains laden with proposals to reverse or overturn Obama &apos;s achievements .
in the new Congress &apos; first couple of weeks , the House passed a bill scaling back the Dodd-Frank financial reform act . numerous proposals are pending to undo significant parts of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , Obama &apos;s signature health-insurance program ( if the Supreme Court does not do the job later this year ) .
moreover , the Senate spent weeks on a bill to force Obama to approve the Keystone XL pipeline , a 1,179-mile conduit to carry oil from Canada &apos;s tar sands to the US for refinement and export . Obama has , as promised , vetoed the bill , owing to the pipeline &apos;s adverse environmental implications .
but it is the House Republicans &apos; move to overturn Obama &apos;s executive actions on immigration reform – which would shield as many as five million undocumented immigrants from deportation – that has turned into the biggest headache for party leaders . they know that in 2016 , the party will need more Hispanic votes than it received in 2012 .
likewise , House Republicans set a trap for their party last December , by demanding that funding of the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) be separated from legislation funding all other government agencies , so that the anti-immigration legislation could be attached to it .
but , as should have been expected , the Senate – which adopted a bipartisan immigration bill in 2013 – would not accept the anti-immigration baggage . the Republicans &apos; inability to control their House faction has exposed them to responsibility for a DHS shutdown at a time of increased terror threats .
in their first couple of months dominating Congress , the Republicans have passed no major legislation ; taken largely negative positions ; and may be about to impede the operation of a crucial government department . this is exactly where McConnell and other national leaders did not want their party to be .
the Secret Corporate Takeover
such pacts used to be called “ free-trade agreements ” ; in fact , they were managed trade agreements , tailored to corporate interests , largely in the US and the European Union . today , such deals are more often referred to as “ partnerships , ” as in the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) .
it is not hard to see why . these agreements go well beyond trade , governing investment and intellectual property as well , imposing fundamental changes to countries ’ legal , judicial , and regulatory frameworks , without input or accountability through democratic institutions .
there have been very few expropriations in recent decades , and investors who want to protect themselves can buy insurance from the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency , a World Bank affiliate ( the US and other governments provide similar insurance ) . nonetheless , the US is demanding such provisions in the TPP , even though many of its “ partners ” have property protections and judicial systems that are as good as its own .
the real intent of these provisions is to impede health , environmental , safety , and , yes , even financial regulations meant to protect America ’ s own economy and citizens . companies can sue governments for full compensation for any reduction in their future expected profits resulting from regulatory changes .
Philip Morris is suing Uruguay and Australia for requiring warning labels on cigarettes . admittedly , both countries went a little further than the US , mandating the inclusion of graphic images showing the consequences of cigarette smoking .
it is discouraging smoking . so now Philip Morris is demanding to be compensated for lost profits .
in the future , if we discover that some other product causes health problems ( think of asbestos ) , rather than facing lawsuits for the costs imposed on us , the manufacturer could sue governments for restraining them from killing more people . the same thing could happen if our governments impose more stringent regulations to protect us from the impact of greenhouse-gas emissions .
when I chaired President Bill Clinton ’ s Council of Economic Advisers , anti-environmentalists tried to enact a similar provision , called “ regulatory takings . ” They knew that once enacted , regulations would be brought to a halt , simply because government could not afford to pay the compensation .
but now the same groups are attempting an end run around democratic processes by inserting such provisions in trade bills , the contents of which are being kept largely secret from the public ( but not from the corporations that are pushing for them ) . it is only from leaks , and from talking to government officials who seem more committed to democratic processes , that we know what is happening .
fundamental to America ’ s system of government is an impartial public judiciary , with legal standards built up over the decades , based on principles of transparency , precedent , and the opportunity to appeal unfavorable decisions . all of this is being set aside , as the new agreements call for private , non-transparent , and very expensive arbitration .
the proceedings are so expensive that Uruguay has had to turn to Michael Bloomberg and other wealthy Americans committed to health to defend itself against Philip Morris . and , though corporations can bring suit , others cannot .
if there ever was a one-sided dispute-resolution mechanism that violates basic principles , this is it . that is why I joined leading US legal experts , including from Harvard , Yale , and Berkeley , in writing a letter to congressional leaders explaining how damaging to our system of justice these agreements are .
American supporters of such agreements point out that the US has been sued only a few times so far , and has not lost a case . corporations , however , are just learning how to use these agreements to their advantage .
and high-priced corporate lawyers in the US , Europe , and Japan will likely outmatch the underpaid government lawyers attempting to defend the public interest . worse still , corporations in advanced countries can create subsidiaries in member countries through which to invest back home , and then sue , giving them a new channel to bloc regulations .
if there were a need for better property protection , and if this private , expensive dispute-resolution mechanism were superior to a public judiciary , we should be changing the law not just for well-heeled foreign companies , but also for our own citizens and small businesses . but there has been no suggestion that this is the case .
they affect relative bargaining power , with important implications for inequality , a growing problem around the world . the question is whether we should allow rich corporations to use provisions hidden in so-called trade agreements to dictate how we will live in the twenty-first century .
new and Improved Trade Agreements ?
in marketing the TPP , Obama tends to emphasize some of the features that distinguish it from earlier pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) . these include commitments by Pacific countries on the environment and the expansion of enforceable labor rights , as well as the geopolitical argument for America ’ s much-discussed strategic “ rebalancing ” toward Asia .
NAFTA and other previous trade agreements are unpopular . so the Obama administration ’ s argument is apparently , “ We have learned from our mistakes .
but the premise is wrong : the previous agreements did benefit the US ( and its partners ) . the most straightforward argument for TPP is that similar economic benefits are likely to follow .
the economic arguments for the gains from trade of course go back to David Ricardo ’ s classic theory of comparative advantage . countries benefit most from producing and exporting what they are relatively best at producing and exporting , and from importing what other countries are relatively better at producing .
moreover , trade boosts productivity , which is why exporters pay higher wages than other companies , on average – an estimated 18 % higher in the case of US manufacturing . and the purchasing power of income is enhanced by households ’ opportunity to consume lower-priced imported goods .
this concern is a first cousin to the old mercantilist focus on whether a policy will improve or worsen the trade balance . a “ mercantilist ” could be defined as someone who believes that gains go only to the country that enjoys a higher trade surplus , mirrored by losses for the trading partner that runs a correspondingly higher deficit .
TPP participants such as Vietnam , Malaysia , and Japan have higher tariff and non-tariff barriers against some products that the US would like to be able to sell them than the US does against their goods . liberalization would thus benefit US exports to Asia more than Asian exports to the US .
the late 1990s offer a good illustration of how trade theory works in the real world . the volume of trade increased rapidly , owing partly to NAFTA in 1994 and the establishment in 1995 of the World Trade Organization as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
but the widening of the trade deficit had no negative effect on output and employment . real ( inflation-adjusted ) GDP growth averaged 4.3 % during 1996-2000 , productivity increased by 2.5 % per year , and workers received their share of those gains as real compensation per hour rose at a 2.2 % annual pace .
a stronger trade balance in the late 1990s would not have added to output growth or job creation , which were running at full throttle . further increases in net export demand would have been met only by attracting workers away from the production of something else .
admittedly , it is harder to make the case for freer trade – particularly for unilateral liberalization – when unemployment is high and output is below potential , as was true in the aftermath of the financial crisis and recession of 2007-2009 . under such circumstances , there is a kernel of truth to mercantilist logic : trade surpluses contribute to GDP and employment , coming at the expense of deficit countries .
in response to the 2008-2009 global recession , for example , G-20 leaders agreed to refrain from new trade barriers . contrary to many cynical predictions , Obama and his counterparts successfully fulfilled this commitment , avoiding a repeat of the debacle caused in the 1930s by America ’ s introduction of import tariffs .
the US unemployment rate has fallen well below 6 % – not quite full employment , but close . if output and employment were rising this year as rapidly as in 2014 , the Federal Reserve would probably have felt the need to start raising interest rates as early as this June .
but the bottom line is that if the US can boost auto exports to Malaysia , agricultural exports to Japan , and service exports to Vietnam , real wages will be bid upward more than by the creation of more jobs . that is why , if it is allowed to proceed , the TPP will , like past trade deals , help put real median US incomes back on a rising trend .
America ’ s Education Bubble
San FRANCISCO – One of the fundamental purposes of government is to advance important public goods . but , if not handled carefully , the pursuit of significant social goals can have unfortunate economic and financial consequences , sometimes even leading to systemic disruptions that undermine more than just the goals themselves .
it has been playing out more recently in China , following an initiative to broaden stock-market participation . and it could happen again in the US , this time as the result of an attempt to improve access to funding for higher education .
the surge in debt-enabled demand drove up real-estate prices , while banks ’ greater willingness to lend led many people to purchase homes they couldn ’ t afford . the collapse of the subsequent bubble – a major contributor to the 2008 global financial crisis – nearly tipped the world economy into a multi-year depression .
in China ’ s case , the government hoped that broader stock-market participation – achieved through efforts to bolster equity prices and promote lending for investment – would make citizens more open to pro-market reforms . again , the approach proved too effective , and a bubble formed .
America ’ s effort to expand access to student loans – a fundamentally good initiative , aimed at enabling more people to pursue higher education – carries similar risks . fortunately , there is still time to do something about it .
higher levels of educational attainment improve overall economic wellbeing and prosperity , lower retirement burdens , and enhance social mobility and satisfaction . the unemployment rate for college graduates in the US , at 2.5 % , is roughly one-third the rate for those without a high school diploma .
what policymakers must determine is how to invest in education in ways that maximize these benefits , without creating new risks . this is where the US risks falling short .
over the last ten years , the combination of higher tuition fees , more student enrollment , and greater reliance on loans has caused the stock of outstanding student debt nearly to triple . it now stands at well over $ 1.2 trillion , more than 60 % of which is held by the bottom quartile of households ( those with a net worth of less than $ 8,500 ) .
today , seven out of ten post-secondary students graduate with debt , with the total volume exceeding debt from credit cards and auto loans combined . moreover , student loans constitute 45 % of federally owned financial assets .
making matters worse , the return on investment in education is falling , because the economy is growing slowly and changing rapidly , making it difficult for some graduates to secure employment that takes advantage of their knowledge and skills . universities are often slow to adapt their curricula to the economy ’ s needs , while new technologies and business models are exacerbating the winner-take-all phenomenon .
if the return on investment in education continues to decline , the servicing of student loans will tend to crowd out other consumption and investment outlays , especially given that student debt has considerable seniority in the capital structure . in this scenario , the risks of default and delinquency would rise , along with financial insecurity and general instability , all of which would exacerbate the inequality trifecta ( income , wealth , and opportunity ) .
the good news is that , though some 10 % of borrowers already face repayment problems , the macroeconomic and financial tipping points remain some way off . but this is no excuse for complacency ; it merely provides time for a concerted effort to implement measures that will ameliorate the destructive trends stemming from student loans .
first and foremost , US politicians need to take full responsibility for economic governance , seeking not only to boost growth , but also to avert a reduction in long-term growth potential . after depending on unconventional monetary policy for far too long , the US Congress needs to adopt a more comprehensive approach , with measures aimed at improving worker training and retooling , modernizing education curricula , and incorporating transformational technologies more effectively into the economy .
for their part , universities – which have benefited considerably from the wide availability of student loans – should rein in their costs , while offering more direct financial aid funded through philanthropy . some universities have already adopted “ no loan ” policies ; students ’ demonstrated financial need is met entirely with grants financed by the university and other donors .
efforts could also be made to encourage households to save more , starting earlier , for education . student loan disclosures should be made more transparent , thereby enabling applicants to make responsible decisions , with lower-cost two-year community colleges serving as a useful stepping stone to a traditional college education .
as borrowers ’ growing debt burdens limit their financial flexibility and productive contribution to the economy , the policy emphasis will shift from mitigating future risks to reducing indebtedness directly through loan forgiveness and bailouts . that would raise thorny issues of fairness and misaligned incentives , and could ultimately have the perverse effect of reducing educational access .
Afghanistan ’ s Unavoidable Partition
foreign military intervention can effect regime change , but it evidently cannot reestablish order based on centralized government . Iraq has been partitioned in all but name into Shia , Sunni , and Kurdish regions , while Libya seems headed toward a similar tripartite , tribal-based territorial arrangement .
Afghanistan ’ s large ethnic groups already enjoy de facto autonomy , which they secured after their Northern Alliance played a central role in the US-led ouster of the Taliban from power in late 2001 . having enjoyed virtual self-rule since then , they will fiercely resist falling back under the sway of the Pashtuns , who have ruled the country for most of its history .
for their part , the Pashtuns , despite their tribal divisions , will not be content with control of a rump Afghanistan consisting of its current eastern and southeastern provinces . they will eventually seek integration with fellow Pashtuns in Pakistan , across the British-drawn Durand Line – a border that Afghanistan has never recognized .
after waging the longest war in its history , at a cost of tens of thousands of lives and nearly a trillion dollars , the US is combat-weary and financially strapped . but the American effort to cut a deal with the Pashtun-based , Pakistan-backed Taliban is stirring deep unease among the non-Pashtun groups , which suffered greatly under the Taliban and its five-year rule .
while Karzai has been fickle , to say the least , about cooperation with the Americans ( indeed , he has since backed away from participation in the Doha talks ) , the rupture of his political alliance with non-Pashtun leaders has also fueled ethnic polarization . some non-Pashtun power brokers continue to support Karzai , but many others are now leading the opposition National Front .
these leaders are unlikely to accept any power-sharing arrangement that includes the Taliban . in fact , they suspect that Karzai ’ s ultimate goal is to restore Pashtun dominance throughout Afghanistan .
their misgivings have been strengthened by the “ Peace Process Roadmap to 2015 , ” a document prepared by the Karzai-constituted Afghan High Peace Council that sketches several potential concessions to the Taliban and Pakistan , ranging from the Taliban ’ s recognition as a political party to a role for Pakistan in Afghanistan ’ s internal affairs . the roadmap even dangles the carrot of cabinet posts and provincial governorships to prominent Taliban figures .
the most serious problem today is that the country ’ s ethnic tensions and recriminations threaten to undermine the cohesion of the fledgling , multiethnic Afghan Army . indeed , the splits today resemble those that occurred when Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 , an exit that led to civil war and the Taliban ’ s eventual capture of the capital , Kabul .
this time , the non-Pashtun communities are better armed and prepared to defend their interests after the US withdrawal . thus , in seeking to co-opt the Taliban , the US is not only bestowing legitimacy on a thuggish militia ; it also risks unwittingly reigniting Afghanistan ’ s ethnic strife , which would most likely tear the country apart for good .
this raises a fundamental question : is Afghanistan ’ s territorial unity really essential for regional or international security ?
to be sure , the sanctity of existing borders has become a powerful norm in world politics . yet this norm has permitted the emergence of ungovernable and unmanageable states , whose internal wars spill across international boundaries , fueling regional tensions and insecurity .
a weak , partitioned Afghanistan may not be a desirable outcome ; but a “ soft ” partition now would be far better than a “ hard ” partition later , after years of chaos and bloodletting – and infinitely better than the medieval Taliban ’ s return to power and a fresh reign of terror .
securing the Internet Commons
most recently that debate has focused on encryption : whether technology companies should be able to develop programs that encrypt their users ’ messages so securely that no one but their intended recipients – not even governments – can read them . it is a debate to which governments and citizens everywhere should pay attention .
not surprisingly , the US government ’ s national security officials oppose full encryption by American technology companies , arguing that the country will be less safe if the proper authorities have no “ backdoor ” – a piece of code that lets them in . software engineers call backdoors “ vulnerabilities , ” deliberate efforts to weaken security .
a large coalition of technology companies and civil-society organizations recently sent a letter to President Barack Obama arguing against backdoors . in addition to “ undermining every American ’ s cyber security and the nation ’ s economic security , ” the signers argued , “ introducing new vulnerabilities to weaken encrypted products in the US would also undermine human rights and information security around the globe . ”
the US government will not be able to object , given its own policies . the result “ will be an information environment riddled with vulnerabilities that could be exploited by even the most repressive or dangerous regimes . ”
the technology corporations that signed this letter understand that while they may be incorporated in the US , they are global players and have global responsibilities . they also understand , in a more self-interested vein , that if foreign consumers believe that using American social media and search engines exposes them to the scrutiny of US intelligence agencies , those consumers will turn to other providers .
the response of many foreign governments has been to focus on how to ensure and protect their “ technological sovereignty . ” Information may transcend borders , but servers and cables still have physical locations .
but the most important issues to sort out are less about feasibility than about desirability , from both a national and a global perspective . as with US companies , it is important to differentiate among corporate , economic , and public interests at the national and global levels .
for starters , digital protectionism should be as suspect as any other form of protectionism , albeit with exceptions for health , safety , and social solidarity . “ Technological sovereignty ” can easily be a pretext for insisting that citizens buy only homegrown tech products .
the Internet is essentially a country with both state and non-state actors as its citizens . it is our task to ensure that it is a free , open , and universally accessible country that advances and safeguards universal human rights .
principle 8 mandates “ transparency , fair process , and accountability ” across the Internet ; Principle 11 promotes “ creativity and innovation ” ; and Principle 13 “ encourage &#91; s &#93; cooperation to promote Internet security . ”
other countries and regional organizations have come up with similar guidance . the point is less the specific wording or even content than the recognition that such principles are necessary for policymakers around the world .
the New America-GPPI report is entitled “ Technological Sovereignty : missing the Point ? ” The authors conclude that “ data privacy and security depend primarily not on where data is physically stored or sent , but on how it is stored and transmitted . ”
still , the larger lesson is that differentiating between national security and global security in the digital world may be both impossible and deeply counter-productive . we need new maps and mindsets and new coalitions of business , civic activists , and all those who understand that national security must include the protection of privacy and freedom of expression .
Pakistan ’ s Winnable War on Polio
Lahore – I grew up in Pakistan throughout the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , and my parents , like parents everywhere , wanted me to be fit and healthy and to get the best start in life . I was lucky enough to be brought up in a middle-class family with good sanitation facilities and clean water .
but I remember the many children in my neighborhood who were not vaccinated . those early experiences of children I knew contracting disease , especially the poliovirus that is so visibly impairing , shaped my views on the immense value of good health and the power of vaccines .
as head of the British Pakistan Foundation , I help philanthropists from the Pakistani diaspora invest in sustainable and effective social development projects . over the last few weeks , I have been in my hometown of Lahore , the country ’ s second-largest city , discussing everything from the upcoming elections to everyday life challenges .
but , thanks to intensive vaccination campaigns , there were only 58 cases of polio in the entire country last year – down 70 % from 2011 . and the government and international health officials have agreed on a plan to stop polio transmission in Pakistan completely by the end of 2014 – a historic accomplishment that would be a huge source of national pride .
Nineteen years later , Aseefa is Pakistan ’ s Goodwill Ambassador on Polio Eradication and a powerful advocate of completing her mother ’ s dream of a polio-free country . international public-private partnerships and an army of vaccinators are working on the frontlines to protect every last child .
for example , vitamin A drops – which provide infants with an essential micronutrient for vision and healthy growth – are now delivered twice yearly in conjunction with polio vaccines . moreover , last year Pakistan became the first country in the region to introduce the latest vaccine to protect children against pneumonia .
there is an important debate taking place in our country about how best to organize the health-care system so that it is accountable for serving the poorest and most marginalized communities . the size of the challenges that we face was made clear at the beginning of this year , when a measles outbreak killed more than 300 children in Pakistan – most of whom had not received vaccines .
with the upcoming elections , we have a valuable opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to vaccines by strengthening national leadership on health and increasing investment in the health-care system . and , as I heard from the guardians at the orphanage , educating communities about the value of vaccines and mobilizing their support is critical for reaching every last child .
it is also changing lives for the better . with continued support for vital vaccines from Pakistan ’ s government and people , I am hopeful that the next time I return home , there will be even more reasons to be optimistic about our children ’ s future .
vaccination ’ s Lifetime of Blessings
but , unlike most dreams , this one is achievable . over my lifetime , I have been fortunate to witness the extraordinary impact that vaccines have had on protecting children from illness and death – especially in the developing world .
back then – in the early 1930 ’ s – there was no vaccine for this highly infectious disease . with good reason , parents everywhere were terrified that poliovirus would reach their doorstep – like a plague – striking a child and causing irreversible paralysis in a matter of hours , or , worse , death in a matter of days .
fortunately , I recovered , except for the use of my right hand . I have gone on to live a wonderful life , but the paralysis in my hand is a daily reminder of why we must urgently pursue the eradication of polio and ensure that all children have access to the vaccines that they need .
in the remaining three countries where polio has not yet been eliminated – Pakistan , Afghanistan , and Nigeria – there were just 223 reported cases in 2012 . this makes me optimistic that I will live to celebrate the day when this dreaded disease is stamped out forever .
the remarkable progress that we have made so far is the result of a sustained global effort , supported by significant resources committed by donor and affected countries , millions of dedicated health workers , and sustained political will to get the job done . but we must finish what we have started .
at the same time , we must make the most of scientific advances over the last half-century , which have made vaccines for other preventable diseases the most powerful and cost-effective health-care investment that currently exists . vaccines are inexpensive and easy to deliver , and they protect children for a lifetime .
most of them live in poor and remote communities that still lack access to the basic vaccines that are universally available in better-off countries . this is one of the reasons why a child born in a high-income country is 18 times less likely than a child born in a low-income country to die before reaching the age of five .
fortunately , the world is taking action . this week in Abu Dhabi , Mohamed bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan , Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi – in partnership with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Bill Gates – is hosting the world ’ s first global summit dedicated to ensuring that all children everywhere have access to the full benefits of vaccines .
the vaccine summit builds on a commitment last year by nearly 200 countries to eradicate polio , develop new and improved vaccines at affordable prices , and deliver them to every child by 2020 .
and the summit in Abu Dhabi has provided a clear plan to get there by 2018 – a strategy that complements other efforts to raise immunization coverage for diseases such as measles , pneumonia , and rotavirus . strengthening routine immunization will protect our gains against polio and enable us to reach the most vulnerable children in the hardest-to-reach and most underserved communities .
having grown up in a country where nearly one in four children infected with polio died from the disease , my heart soars when I imagine a world in which all families have access to lifesaving vaccines , freeing them from the burden of preventable death and disease . now we need funds , commitment , and the resolve to implement the plan presented in Abu Dhabi .
when it comes to the health of our children , there must be no distance between rich and poor , and no distinctions among communities . following through on polio eradication by extending the reach of vaccines to all children who need them is an opportunity for all of us to stand together on behalf of our global community .
valuing the United Nations
Melbourne – There is nothing like exposure to smart and idealistic young people to make jaded and world-weary policymakers and commentators feel better about the future . I have just had that experience meeting delegates to the 22nd World Model United Nations Conference , which brought together in Australia more than 2,000 students from every continent and major culture to debate peace , development , and human rights , and the role of the UN in securing them .
what impressed me most is how passionately this generation of future leaders felt about the relevance and capacity of the UN system . they are right : the UN can deliver when it comes to national security , human security , and human dignity .
no organization in the world embodies as many dreams , yet provides so many frustrations , as the United Nations . for most of its history , the Security Council has been the prisoner of great-power maneuvering ; the General Assembly a theater of empty rhetoric ; the Economic and Social Council a largely dysfunctional irrelevance ; and the Secretariat , for all the dedication and brilliance of a host of individuals , alarmingly inefficient .
my own efforts to advance the cause of UN reform when I was Australia ’ s foreign minister were about as quixotic and unproductive as anything I have ever tried to do . overhauling Secretariat structures and processes to reduce duplication , waste , and irrelevance ?
the peace plan for Cambodia in the early 1990 ’ s , for example , dragged the country back from hellish decades of horrifying genocide and ugly and protracted civil war . likewise , the Chemical Weapons Convention , steered through the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva , is still the most robust arms-control treaty related to weapons of mass destruction ever negotiated .
in 2005 , on the UN ’ s 60th anniversary , the General Assembly , convening at head of state and government level , unanimously endorsed the concept of states ’ responsibility to protect populations at risk of genocide and other mass atrocity crimes . with that vote , the international community began to eradicate the shameful indifference that accompanied the Holocaust , Rwanda , Srebrenica , Darfur , and too many similar catastrophes .
that is less than half the annual budget for New York City , and well under a third of the roughly $ 105 billion that the US military has been spending each year , on average , in Afghanistan . Wall Street employees received more in annual bonuses ( $ 33.2 billion ) in 2007 , the year before the global financial meltdown .
the whole family of the UN Secretariat and related entities , together with current peacekeepers , adds up to around 215,000 people worldwide – not a small number , but less than one-eighth of the roughly 1.8 million staff employed by McDonald ’ s and its franchisees worldwide !
in Defense of Varoufakis
London – From blaming him for the renewed collapse of the Greek economy to accusing him of illegally plotting Greece ’ s exit from the eurozone , it has become fashionable to disparage Yanis Varoufakis , the country ’ s former finance minister . while I have never met or spoken to him , I believe that he is getting a bad rap ( and increasingly so ) .
that is why it is important to take note of the ideas that Varoufakis continues to espouse . Greeks and others may fault him for pursuing his agenda with too little politesse while in office .
following an impressive election victory by his Syriza party in January , Greece ’ s prime minister , Alexis Tsipras , appointed Varoufakis to lead the delicate negotiations with the country ’ s creditors . his mandate was to recast the relationship in two important ways : render its terms more amenable to economic growth and job creation ; and restore balance and dignity to the treatment of Greece by its European partners and the International Monetary Fund .
these issues remain as relevant today , with Varoufakis out of government , as they were when he was tirelessly advocating for them during visits to European capitals and in tense late-night negotiations in Brussels . indeed , many observers view the agreement on a third bailout program that Greece reached with its creditors – barely a week after Varoufakis resigned – as simply more of the same .
in part , the criticism of Varoufakis reflects less the substance of his proposals than the manner in which he approached his interlocutors . eschewing the traditional duality of frank private discussions and restrained public commentary , he aggressively advocated his case openly and bluntly , and did so in an increasingly personal manner .
whether deemed naive or belligerent , this approach undeniably upset and angered European politicians . rather than modifying a policy framework that had failed for five years to deliver on its stated objectives , they dug in their heels , eventually resorting to the economic equivalent of gunboat diplomacy .
some hold him responsible for the renewed collapse of the Greek economy , the unprecedented shuttering of the banking system , and the imposition of stifling capital controls . others are calling for criminal investigations , characterizing the work he led on a Plan B ( whereby Greece would introduce a new payments system either in parallel or instead of the euro ) as tantamount to treason .
Varoufakis had no control over the economic mess that Syriza inherited when it came to power , including an unemployment rate hovering around 25 % and youth joblessness that had been running at more than 50 % for a considerable period . he could not influence in any meaningful manner the national narratives that had sunk deep roots in other European countries and thus undermined those countries ’ ability to adapt .
it also would have been irresponsible for Varoufakis not to work behind closed doors on a Plan B. After all , Greece ’ s eurozone destiny largely was – and remains – in the hands of others ( particularly Germany , the ECB , and the IMF ) . and it is yet to be established whether Varoufakis broke any laws in the way he and his colleagues worked on their contingency plan .
when push came to shove , Varoufakis faced the difficult choice of going along with more of the same , despite knowing that it would fail , or trying to pivot to a new approach . he bravely opted for the latter .
Varoufakis ’ s Great Game
first , there is simple provocation , aimed at riling up Greek citizens and thus escalating tensions between the country and its creditors . Greece ’ s citizens must believe that they are escaping grave injustice if they are to continue to trust their government during the difficult period that would follow an exit from the eurozone .
second , the Greek government is driving up the costs of Plan B for the other side , by allowing capital flight by its citizens . if it so chose , the government could contain this trend with a more conciliatory approach , or stop it outright with the introduction of capital controls .
basically , Greek citizens take out loans from local banks , funded largely by the Greek central bank , which acquires funds through the European Central Bank ’ s emergency liquidity assistance ( ELA ) scheme . they then transfer the money to other countries to purchase foreign assets ( or redeem their debts ) , draining liquidity from their country ’ s banks .
other eurozone central banks are thus forced to create new money to fulfill the payment orders for the Greek citizens , effectively giving the Greek central bank an overdraft credit , as measured by the so-called TARGET liabilities . in January and February , Greece ’ s TARGET debts increased by almost € 1 billion ( $ 1.1 billion ) per day , owing to capital flight by Greek citizens and foreign investors .
but it would leave those countries ’ central banks stuck with euro-denominated TARGET claims vis-à-vis Greece ’ s central bank , which would have assets denominated only in a restored drachma . given the new currency ’ s inevitable devaluation , together with the fact that the Greek government does not have to backstop its central bank ’ s debt , a default depriving the other central banks of their claims would be all but certain .
all of this strengthens the Greek government ’ s negotiating position considerably . small wonder , then , that Varoufakis and Tsipras are playing for time , refusing to submit a list of meaningful reform proposals .
by failing to produce the two-thirds majority in the ECB Council needed to limit the Greek central bank ’ s self-serving strategy , it has allowed the creation of more than € 80 billion in emergency liquidity , which exceeds the Greek central bank ’ s € 41 billion in recoverable assets . with Greece ’ s banks guaranteed the needed funds , the government has been spared from having to introduce capital controls .
rumor has it that the ECB is poised to adjust its approach – and soon . it knows that its argument that the ELA loans are collateralized is wearing thin , given that , in many cases , the collateral has a rating below BBB- , thus falling short of investment grade .
if the ECB finally acknowledges that this will not do , and removes Greece ’ s liquidity safety net , the Greek government would be forced to start negotiating seriously , because waiting would no longer do it any good . but , with the stock of money sent abroad and held in cash having already ballooned to 79 % of GDP , its position would remain very strong .
in other words , thanks largely to the ECB , the Greek government would be able to secure a far more favorable outcome – including increased financial assistance and reduced reform requirements – than it could have gained at any point in the past . and if Greece exits , a large share of the acquired resources measured by the TARGET balances and the cash that has been printed would turn into an endowment gift for an independent future .
many people in Europe seem to believe that Varoufakis , an experienced game theorist but a political neophyte , does not know how to play the cards that Greece has been dealt . they should think again – before Greece walks away with the pot .
European Universities ’ Identity Crisis
what should universities ’ primary focus be – research , professional training , or social inclusion ? should governments invest more in higher education to underpin long-term economic growth ?
amid the debates about their future role , Europe ’ s universities must not lose sight of their individual identity , their traditions , and their sense of social purpose . this will not be easy .
moreover , the parameters of the debate are becoming hazy . on one hand , universities are abiding by long-standing agreements with government ; on the other , they face zealous reformers who seek market-based solutions that stress competition among institutions , encourage staff and student mobility , and emphasize student-centered learning .
obviously , these outlooks generate very different implications for universities ’ future . traditionally , universities undertook research , provided a professional education , and offered a country ’ s young people a cultural foundation as they entered society .
seeking truth through observation , experimentation , rational argument , and mutual criticism has always been a raison d ’ être of universities . reflecting this , some European institutions are encouraged by government to try to match the research excellence attained by top universities in the United States .
this purpose may seem increasingly controversial in pluralistic Western societies , but universities should at least provide their students with an understanding of the models , history , and philosophical fundamentals with which to debate these issues . without a reasonable awareness of their socio-cultural environment , students may view universities merely as a place to pursue private goals , make useful connections , enjoy student life , and perhaps pick up a superficial sense of diversity .
whichever path Europe ’ s universities take , maintaining a distinct identity in the face of global change and education reform will become increasingly difficult . researchers are no longer confined within their ivory towers , but work as part of complex global networks alongside private-sector participants .
likewise , in the emerging conception of universities – one that draws heavily from the corporate world – educational “ managers , ” applying “ best practices ” ( and always ready to move on to the next posting ) – retain the most cursory regard for the institution ’ s life and traditions . and students , seen as mere consumers of a service , are invited to exercise choice regarding teachers , curricula , and location .
but their purpose will be lost if pursuing them weakens the very identity of Europe ’ s universities , many of which are used to functioning in a world of state patronage and strict regulation . policymakers must be aware of the educational and cultural damage that continuous reforms – all justified in the future-oriented jargon of the day – can wreak .
a loyal and grateful alumni network can help to ensure this . the alternative is a formulaic educational experience that not only lacks individual character , but that is also devoid of moral purpose .
veiled Sexuality
new YORK – A woman swathed in black to her ankles , wearing a headscarf or a full chador , walks down a European or North American street , surrounded by other women in halter tops , miniskirts and short shorts . she passes under immense billboards on which other women swoon in sexual ecstasy , cavort in lingerie or simply stretch out languorously , almost fully naked .
when France banned headscarves in schools , it used the hijab as a proxy for Western values in general , including the appropriate status of women . when Americans were being prepared for the invasion of Afghanistan , the Taliban were demonized for denying cosmetics and hair color to women ; when the Taliban were overthrown , Western writers often noted that women had taken off their scarves .
but are we in the West radically misinterpreting Muslim sexual mores , particularly the meaning to many Muslim women of being veiled or wearing the chador ? and are we blind to our own markers of the oppression and control of women ?
outside the walls of the typical Muslim households that I visited in Morocco , Jordan , and Egypt , all was demureness and propriety . but inside , women were as interested in allure , seduction , and pleasure as women anywhere in the world .
the bridal videos that I was shown , with the sensuous dancing that the bride learns as part of what makes her a wonderful wife , and which she proudly displays for her bridegroom , suggested that sensuality was not alien to Muslim women . rather , pleasure and sexuality , both male and female , should not be displayed promiscuously – and possibly destructively – for all to see .
I put on a shalwar kameez and a headscarf in Morocco for a trip to the bazaar . yes , some of the warmth I encountered was probably from the novelty of seeing a Westerner so clothed ; but , as I moved about the market – the curve of my breasts covered , the shape of my legs obscured , my long hair not flying about me – I felt a novel sense of calm and serenity .
Islam and Judaism never had that same kind of mind-body split . so , in both cultures , sexuality channeled into marriage and family life is seen as a source of great blessing , sanctioned by God .
among healthy young men in the West , who grow up on pornography and sexual imagery on every street corner , reduced libido is a growing epidemic , so it is easy to imagine the power that sexuality can still carry in a more modest culture . and it is worth understanding the positive experiences that women – and men – can have in cultures where sexuality is more conservatively directed .
victors ’ Justice , Iraqi-Style
Saddam Hussein is dead , but not all Iraqis are celebrating . on the contrary , the way in which the various religious and ethnic groups in Iraq responded to his execution is emblematic of the difficulty of holding Iraq together as a coherent entity .
to the Shiite majority , long brutally oppressed by Saddam and all previous Sunni-dominated Iraqi regimes , Saddam ’ s death symbolizes their attainment of political hegemony . moreover , their triumphalist rejoicing is a cruel reminder that when the oppressed become liberated , they can very easily turn into oppressors themselves .
indeed , the Washington debate surrounding how to “ fix Iraq ” is irrelevant , because something that does not exist any longer – namely , Iraq as a functioning state – cannot be fixed . under the guise of US-inspired constitutional arrangements , the Shia majority has succeeded in arrogating near-absolute power to itself .
there is no power – save a new violent dictatorship – that can bring Shi ’ a , Sunnis , and Kurds to live once again in one body politic . America ’ s chimerical dream of democratizing overnight a deeply divided society accustomed only to violence and coercion has unleashed a terrifying array of political demons .
the US and the entire international community are utterly unequipped to deal with this Middle Eastern version of Yugoslavia and its regional consequences . and , unlike Yugoslavia ’ s successor states , which could look to Europe , the lack of a legitimate Arab democratic role model makes crafting a democratic order even more difficult .
some Europeans and others may gloat over America ’ s failure in Iraq , and the ineptness – or worse – of US post-occupation policy cries to heaven . yet the root causes of that failure go deeper , to Iraq ’ s creation as an artificial entity in the 1920 ’ s by British imperialist planners , who stitched together three disparate provinces of the defeated Ottoman Empire into a state that never had a coherent identity .
indeed , the very foundation of Iraq was based on victors ’ justice : the British Empire , having vanquished the Ottomans , made the Sunni Arabs overlords in a country in which they were a minority . that arrangement has now come unglued following another cycle of victors ’ justice .
the consequences of this re-ordering of power are not yet clear . but a coherent Iraqi state – whether unitary , federal , or confederal – will not grow out of a society in which one part of the population views Saddam , rightly , as a gruesome oppressor , while another part reveres him as a hero and martyr .
wars always have unintended consequences and cruel ironies . in Iraq , only now is it becoming evident that some states cannot be saved without being destroyed .
the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons
Vienna – In 1983 , three years before I was born , a chilling television docudrama about the consequences of a nuclear war was broadcast around the world . the Day After , now cited as the highest-rated film in TV history , left then-US President Ronald Reagan “ greatly depressed ” and caused him to rethink his nuclear strategy .
my generation has conveniently consigned such fears to history . indeed , with the Cold War tensions of 1983 far in the past and the international order dramatically changed , many people nowadays ask why these memories should concern us at all .
this week , Austria is providing the world an opportunity to rethink its complacency . on December 8-9 , representatives from the governments of more than 150 countries , international organizations , and civil-society groups will meet in Vienna , to consider the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons .
these weapons , which terrified people 30 years ago , still remain in countries ’ arsenals and continue to pose a grave risk to human security and safety . Austria ’ s concern is that as long as nuclear weapons exist , the risk of their use exists , either by accident or design .
consider how many nuclear weapons there are : an estimated 16,300 around the world , with 1,800 on high alert and ready for use on short notice . nearly 25 years after the Cold War ’ s end , we remain stuck with its strategic legacy : nuclear weapons continue to underpin the international security policy of the world ’ s most powerful states .
there are too many risks – human error , technical flaws , negligence , cyber attacks , and more – to believe that these weapons will never be used . nor is there good reason to believe that adequate fail-safe mechanisms are in place .
for example , in 1983 , the Soviet Union ’ s nuclear early-warning system reported , not once but twice , the launch of US missiles . fortunately , Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov of the Soviet Air Defense Forces recognized these as false alarms , preventing a mistaken nuclear retaliation .
it is remarkable that the world has avoided disaster thus far . why continue to push our luck ?
since 2012 , when the humanitarian impact initiative was conceived , most countries have stepped up to support it , owing to their anxiety and frustration at the snail-like pace of disarmament . still , one might legitimately ask whether world leaders shouldn ’ t first focus their attention on other problems , such as climate change and sustainable development .
in fact , like past generations ’ loading of the earth ’ s atmosphere with carbon , nuclear weapons represent a legacy to overcome . but nuclear weapons , unusable and extremely expensive to maintain , are low-hanging fruit – a risk that we can easily grasp and eliminate .
enticing the nuclear-weapon states to give up their arsenals will not be easy . as long as some states possess them , other states will be led by envy or fear to desire their own .
but the status quo reflects yesterday ’ s thinking . acknowledgement that these Cold War relics are outmoded security tools – indeed , that they cause insecurity – is coming from a diverse range of voices .
the goal of next week ’ s Vienna conference is to provide the public with new and updated evidence of the impact of using nuclear weapons . the picture is even grimmer and the consequences more dire than we believed in 1983 .
as long as nuclear weapons exist , it is irresponsible not to confront the implications of their use – implications for which there is no antidote or insurance policy . they are not some deadly virus or long-term environmental threat .
Vietnam ’ s Chinese Lessons
its victories over France and the United States were the defining wars of independence of the post-colonial era . but ever since those immortal scenes of US army helicopters hovering above the abandoned US embassy in Saigon in 1975 , Vietnam has mostly slipped from the world ’ s consciousness .
Vietnam ’ s strategic position – as a neighbor of China , situated parallel to the great sea trade routes of Asia – always made the country tremendously important , which may be one reason why its anti-colonial wars lasted so long . in recent years , however , Vietnam ’ s strategic significance has increased dramatically , owing to huge – and not always widely recognized – transformations in its economic performance and foreign-policy orientation .
reinvigorated by two decades of rapid economic growth and a broad-based opening to the outside world , Vietnam is now an emerging player in regional economic and security affairs . indeed , in recent months the country has played a pivotal role in helping to establish Asia ’ s emerging security order .
earlier in October , at the inaugural summit of ASEAN defense ministers in Hanoi , US Defense Secretary Robert Gates declared the US a “ resident power ” in Asia . and earlier this summer , while hosting US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , Vietnam encouraged her to intervene in the growing maritime disputes between China and Malaysia , the Philippines , Japan , and Vietnam itself .
Deng wanted to punish the Vietnamese for their own invasion of Cambodia , which ended the genocidal rule of China ’ s allies , the Khmer Rouge . so vital was this decision to Deng that he assigned overall command of the invasion to his fellow Long March veteran , General Hsu Shih Yun ( who had given Deng shelter when , in 1976 , he was purged for the second time by the dying Mao Zedong ) .
that Chinese invasion was intended to teach India a lesson for its support of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan resistance . an existing border dispute was used as a pretext to launch a swift invasion ( one that caught Nehru ’ s India by surprise ) , inflict a humiliating defeat , and then stage a seemingly magnanimous unilateral withdrawal designed to highlight India ’ s impotence .
in a war that lasted barely a month , 250,000 Chinese front-line soldiers were thrashed by 100,000 Vietnamese border-militia troops . the Chinese lost more soldiers ( perhaps 20,000 ) in those four weeks than the US lost in any single year of the Vietnam War .
the scale of China ’ s defeat stunned Deng , and historians often credit the PLA ’ s miserable performance with forcing him to take a hard look at China ’ s moribund Maoist system . within months of the war ’ s end , indeed , Deng initiated the reforms that have since transformed his country .
ten years later , Vietnam ’ s Communist rulers also concluded that Marxism-Leninism was an economic dead end , and decided to start down the same path of market reform that Deng had taken . as in China , it took time for the benefits to appear , but over the past few years Vietnam has seen the same rapid , poverty-reducing growth that China has experienced .
an agricultural miracle has transformed a country of nearly 90 million people who were once barely able to feed themselves into a global food-exporting powerhouse . Vietnam has also become a major exporter of clothes , shoes , and furniture .
today , that choice must be made anew . by acting to invigorate an Asian order that rejects hegemonic dominance , even to the extent of improving its military ties with the US , Vietnam has shown that it has learned its own lessons from the blood and treasure that it lost in its long wars of independence .
the Global Classroom
mountain VIEW , CALIFORNIA – When I taught at Stanford University in the 1970 ’ s , I was always on the lookout for ways that technology could help to improve learning . the big innovation of that time was that my classes were broadcast around the San Francisco Bay Area .
today , teachers record and upload their lectures , and , thanks to the Internet , students anywhere in the world can watch them as many times as they want . education – one of the last big economic sectors yet to be transformed by the digital age – is on the cusp of a revolution .
for example , MOOCs ( Massive Open Online Courses ) offer free or low-cost , high-quality higher-education classes to hundreds of thousands of people on the Internet , making it easier to learn whatever – and wherever – they want . I see similar opportunities coming to primary and secondary education in the future .
MOOCs enable an unlimited number of students to take courses on almost any subject , from computer science to music , taught by some of the world ’ s leading specialists . some MOOCs have mass appeal , like those from the University of Alicante in Spain and the Humboldt Institute in Germany , both of which offer courses on the practical aspects of starting up a business .
anyone who has ever wanted to figure out just how and why footballers get paid as much as they do can sign up for the Valoración de Futbolistas MOOC offered by the University of Valencia . in this program , one can learn all one ever wanted about how to assess a footballer ’ s value .
wherever youth unemployment remains high , MOOCs offer a new way to boost skills and employability . a key area should be support for teachers , particularly in computer science , especially in middle and high school curricula .
Malaysia ’ s government has announced a plan to provide lightweight laptops to primary and secondary schools nationwide , and has adopted free Web-based email , calendar , and document processing for ten million students , teachers , and parents . providing Web-based services to students and educators enables access to information and makes it possible for everyone – regardless of financial resources , location , or influence – to become educated .
governments must expand national infrastructure so that students in densely packed urban areas and remote rural villages alike can get online . public-private partnerships are often a good way to do this .
once students are online , there is no limit to what they can do with the vast amount of information available to them or how they will collaborate with and learn from one another . imagine students in Malaysia working with students around the world on a weather project .
where desktop or laptop computers are not widely available , students might use smartphones or tablets to augment their learning . for example , they could turn to sophisticated mobile biology apps that let them interact with a 3D version of a cell , or polling apps that they could use to conduct a psychology experiment .
it might be difficult for a child to go to a classmate ’ s house to study after school , because of bad roads , unsafe neighborhoods , or parents who are working and cannot provide a lift ( or do not own a car ) . with sufficient bandwidth , students can now meet virtually via Google + Hangouts or other social-media platforms and study together – or with the leading experts on the planet .
virtual Vices
in a popular Internet role-playing game called Second Life , people can create a virtual identity for themselves , choosing such things as their age , sex , and appearance . these virtual characters then do things that people in the real world do , such as having sex .
if you did that in the real world , most of us would agree that you did something seriously wrong . but is it seriously wrong to have virtual sex with a virtual child ?
meanwhile , the manufacturers , Linden Labs , have said they will modify the game to prevent virtual children from having sex . German prosecutors have also become involved , although their concern appears to be the use of the game to spread child pornography , rather than whether people have virtual sex with virtual children .
laws against child pornography in other countries may also have the effect of prohibiting games that permit virtual sex with virtual children . in Australia , Connor O ’ Brien , chair of the criminal law section of the Law Institute of Victoria , recently told the Melbourne newspaper The Age that he thought the manufacturer of Second Life could be prosecuted for publishing images of children in a sexual context .
it becomes much more dubious when it interferes with sexual acts between consenting adults . what adults choose to do in the bedroom , many thoughtful people believe , is their own business , and the state ought not to pry into it .
if you get aroused by having your adult partner dress up as a schoolchild before you have sex , and he or she is happy to enter into that fantasy , your behavior may be abhorrent to most people , but as long as it is done in private , few would think that it makes you a criminal .
nor should it make any difference if you invite a few adult friends over , and in the privacy of your own home they all choose to take part in a larger-scale sexual fantasy of the same kind . are computers linked via the Internet – again , assuming that only consenting adults are involved – so different from a group fantasy of this kind ?
when someone proposes making something a criminal offense , we should always ask : who is harmed ? if it can be shown that the opportunity to act out a fantasy by having virtual sex with a virtual child makes people more likely to engage in real pedophilia , then real children will be harmed , and the case for prohibiting virtual pedophilia becomes stronger .
but looking at the question in this way raises another , and perhaps more significant , issue about virtual activities : video game violence .
doom , a popular violent videogame , was a favorite of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold , the teenage Columbine High School murderers . in a chilling videotape they made before the massacre , Harris says “ It &apos;s going to be like fucking Doom … .That fucking shotgun &#91; he kisses his gun &#93; is straight out of Doom ! ”
more weight , however , should be given to the growing number of scientific studies , both in the laboratory and in the field , of the effect of such games . in Violent Video Game Effects on Children and Adults , Craig Anderson , Douglas Gentile , and Katherine Buckley , of the Department of Psychology at Iowa State University , draw these studies together to argue that violent video games increase aggressive behavior .
if criminal prosecution is too blunt an instrument to use against violent video games , there is a case for awarding damages to the victims , or families of the victims , of violent crimes committed by people who play violent video games . to date , such lawsuits have been dismissed , at least in part on the grounds that the manufacturers could not foresee that their products would cause people to commit crimes .
André Peschke , editor-in-chief of Krawall.de , one of Germany ’ s leading online computer and video game magazines , informs me that in ten years in the video game industry , he has never seen any serious debate within the industry on the ethics of producing violent games . the manufacturers fall back on the simplistic assertion that there is no scientific proof that violent video games lead to violent acts .
video games are properly subject to legal controls , not when they enable people to do things that , if real , would be crimes , but when there is evidence on the basis of which we can reasonably conclude that they are likely to increase serious crime in the real world . at present , the evidence for that is stronger for games involving violence than it is for virtual realities that permit pedophilia .
Vladimir de Gaulle ?
the greatest disappointment of the postcommunist era has been the failure of the West – particularly Europe – to build a successful relationship with Russia . most policymakers and experts expected that , after an inevitably troublesome period of transition , Russia would join the United States and Europe in a strategic and economic partnership , based on shared interests and values .
a resurgent Russia is the world ’ s foremost revisionist power , rejecting a status quo predicated on the notion of a Western victory in the Cold War . its two super-power assets – nuclear weapons and energy – make it a potential leader of all those lesser powers dissatisfied with their position in the world .
second , the Bush administration ’ s unilateralism shattered the belief that the US would continue to provide the world with “ multilateral ” leadership ; indeed , US unilateralism was a cue for Russia to pursue its own unilateral policy . third , Russia has not yet become economically integrated with the West , especially Europe , as was expected .
what happens when the pull of a country ’ s imperial history meets the constraints of its current international position ? will it try to weaken the constraints ?
I believe that the attempt by President Putin ’ s Kremlin to impose “ liberal empire ” or “ sovereign democracy ” on the post-Soviet states will fail . of course , Russia is bound to exercise strong influence in the former Soviet territories , but it will have to share that influence with others .
we may see some compromise between European ( Sarkozy-style ) capitalism and an authoritarian , protectionist model with a lot of industrial policy . this is the kind of civilizational choice that sovereign countries are entitled to make for themselves .
the territorial and economic imperatives of empire will continue to make it difficult for Russia to develop a political system that conforms to Western norms . the middle class will expand , but there is no assurance that it will become “ liberal ” in the Western sense .
the Russian strain of political messianism is pretty much exhausted . nevertheless , Russia may be able to develop , out of its own spiritual and cultural resources , an attractive alternative to both the American and European models , provided it achieves long run economic success .
a suggestive analogy may be to France during the long period of Anglo-American hegemony . broadly speaking , France has been the “ awkward partner ” in the Anglo-American club – a role it played right up to its orchestration of opposition to the Iraq war in 2003 .
France , uniquely in Western Europe , built its own independent nuclear deterrent , and has been a champion of creating a European military capacity outside NATO . without explicitly challenging US leadership , France tried to build its own “ Ostpolitik ” with Russia , and to use its axis with Germany to create a European position on foreign policy .
the French have been the most insistent that Europe has interests that are not identical to America ’ s – particularly in the Middle East , where France has been pro-Arab . and , like de Gaulle , Putin has sought to rescue his country from humiliation and defeat by carving out a role consonant with popular feelings of national mission and pride , with national interest interpreted as “ sovereignty . ”
the Gaullist dream of creating an independent power center never succeeded , but the role of “ awkward partner ” has given a distinctive flavor to French diplomacy , and it may be equally viable for a shrunken , proud , but no longer hegemonic Russia . being an “ awkward partner ” may offer Russia its best hope of reconciling its yearning for independence with the realities of the modern world .
Vladimir Putin , Part Two
in the West , he is regarded as an “ authoritarian , ” an “ autocrat , ” even as a “ dictator ” while in Russia a huge majority regard him as the most “ democratic ” of leaders , on the grounds that he has done more than his predecessors to improve the lot of ordinary people . but there is one point on which both camps agree : Putin intends to remain in power indefinitely .
that conclusion stems from Putin ’ s recent statement that he might become prime minister after relinquishing the presidency next May . but , regardless of what Putin does , his personal influence and the strategic direction in which he has taken Russia will remain dominant for years to come .
given this reality , what matters now is how this “ Putin system ” will work , which will depend on institutional frameworks and practices . at stake , both for Russia and the wider world , are stability and legitimacy , hence the prospects for steady political and economic modernization .
legitimacy and stability are inseparable in practice , because maintaining stability in the absence of legitimacy would ultimately require Tiananmen-style repression . but this can be ruled out in today ’ s Russia , because the instruments to implement it – notably an army that would obey orders to mow people down in the streets – are lacking .
much opinion poll evidence shows that the presidency is the only institution that Russians accept as legitimate ( in contrast to the legislature and judiciary , which are perceived as corrupt and ineffective ) . this is not surprising , given the country ’ s history and culture .
in Russia ’ s current political cycle , which will culminate in the presidential election of March 2008 , there will be no difficulty in meeting the main conditions of legitimacy : respecting the constitution ’ s rules about regular free elections to the presidency . given Putin ’ s popularity , these rules present no threat to the ruling group ’ s power .
but looking forward to the next political cycle in 2012 , or the one after that in 2016 , there is no guarantee that today ’ s conditions will still apply . invincible popularity can evaporate .
this is what happened in Ukraine in November 2004 , with revolutionary consequences . it would be rash to assume that the outcome in Russia would be as benign as Ukraine ’ s “ Orange Revolution . ”
integrating the presidency into broader political structures and procedures – especially into party politics – would reduce this risk . a political party infused with a normal instinct for self-preservation would produce a fresh face to run in a proper presidential election , replacing an unpopular incumbent and his cronies .
as it happens , Putin is now entrenching the already dominant United Russia party by his decision to head the party ’ s candidate list in December ’ s parliamentary election . could Russia emulate Japan ’ s post-war model , in which a single dominant party revives and modernizes the country ?
like all historical analogies , this one may prove flawed , but it is not absurd . Japan ’ s
while inferior to the open alternation of power between two or more political parties , the evolution of United Russia into something resembling the LDP would still leave Russia in a much better shape than a personal regime confined to the Kremlin . despite Russia ’ s history after 1917 , one dominant political party is preferable to none at all .
Putin ’ s recent public statements point to such a vision : a dominant center-right ruling party , with a ( non-communist ) social democratic alternative waiting in the wings to maintain stable government should the main party falter . as so often in politics , much will depend on how far Putin matches deeds to words after leaving the presidency .
should he choose to exercise his vast residual influence through United Russia ( with its inevitable majority in the newly elected parliament ) , we will know that he means what he says . if , by contrast , he leaves the presidency , gets himself appointed prime minister , and overhauls the constitution to shift powers from the former to the latter , we will know that he is going for a personal regime after all .
emasculating the elected presidency , which is Russia ’ s sole source of political legitimacy , would pave the way to chaos . the habit of changing the rules to keep power would persist after the strongman eventually leaves the scene , but the superficial stability of his rule would not .
Vladimir Putin ’ s Potemkin Nation
Moscow – “ Image is everything ” might be a viable credo if you are the house of Gucci or a catwalk model , but it is definitely not appropriate as a national strategy . yet “ Putinism , ” the ruling ideology of the Russia that Vladimir Putin has forged during his ten years in power , is all about image – the image of a reconstituted great power restored to the world stage .
the problem is that , unlike the rail thin catwalk model who starves herself half to death to stay slim , the image of Russia that Putin seeks to project is completely imaginary . the Russian economy is a shambles , and Russia ’ s mighty military had to exert itself to its fullest to vanquish tiny Georgia in 2008 .
of course , Russia ’ s rulers have usually preferred myth to reality . after all , it was during the reign of Catherine the Great that the “ Potemkin village ” was invented , whereby the squalor of the lives of Catherine ’ s serfs was hidden behind cheerfully painted housing façades as the Empress toured her country .
in today ’ s Russia , the overriding myth is that Putin has presided over a rapidly modernizing country . here the cheerful façade is composed of Russia ’ s miniature president , Dmitri Medvedev , whose job – like that of the American First Lady – is to keep up appearances .
today , for the first time in our history , we have a chance to prove to ourselves and the world that Russia can develop democratically . our political system will be extremely open , flexible . ”
and , just this October , remembering the victims of Stalin , Medvedev wrote in his blog ( itself a sign meant to convey how up-to-date he is ) , “ We can hear voices saying that those numerous deaths were justified by some supreme goals of the state . I am convinced that no development of a country , no success or ambitions , can be achieved through human grief and losses .
of course , if Medvedev actually meant what he says , he would be leading the opposition to the Russian state that Putin has built . but , since Putin put Medvedev in his job and can remove him anytime he pleases , Russia ’ s president is not opposed to the ways of the Putin regime .
Putin ’ s political genius is that he understands that , for Russians , being perceived as powerful is even more important than actually being powerful . he does not need to modernize Russia so that it can actually compete with the world ’ s mightiest powers ; he just needs to bluster enough that people – particularly his own – believe that Russia is once again among the first rank of nations .
moreover , Putin ’ s project to safeguard “ great Russian statehood ” from the disarray of the post-Soviet era has seen the imprisoning of “ dishonest ” oligarchs ; the prosecution of an “ irresponsible ” press ; and the establishment of his personal dictatorship over the rule of law .
because the world associates these traits with the Soviet era , many people mistake their reappearance as a sign that Russian power is now approaching that of the USSR . nothing could be farther from the truth .
likewise , instead of welcoming the sort of foreign investors who can modernize the economy , the regime continues to wage its judicial war against Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev of Yukos Oil . they were convicted for financial crimes in a 2004 trial , but in August faced a fresh round of charges , including tax evasion and embezzlement .
journalists and human rights activists and lawyers – Anna Politkovskaya , Stanislav Markelov , Anastasia Baburova , Natalia Estemirova , and dozens of others – are murdered , and no one in the Kremlin seems to mind , because they are not really a part of the New Russia that Putin is building . indeed , just this November , Sergei Magnitsky , a lawyer for Hermitage Capital Management , died in prison because of his captors ’ negligence .
perhaps US Vice President Joe Biden summed up Russia ’ s predicament best : “ The reality is , the Russians are where they are , having a shrinking population base , a withering economy , and a banking structure that is unlikely to withstand the next 15 years . the world ’ s changing before them and they ’ re clinging to something in the past that ’ s not sustainable . ”
the Goebbels of the Kremlin
any deviation from officially sanctioned behavior would be treated with suspicion and most likely punished . the Soviet state saw itself as being at war with almost everything – foreign spies , class enemies , people wearing jeans or playing jazz .
indeed , an ethos of perpetual vigilance is central to sustaining President Vladimir Putin ’ s high popular-approval ratings . and no one plays a more important role in creating the necessary public atmosphere than Vladislav Surkov .
he has been credited with the introduction of the concept of “ managed democracy ” in Russia , and he played a leading role in nurturing the secession of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia . more recently , he was a guiding hand behind Russia ’ s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea , inspiring the feverish media campaigns that have delivered near-universal public support for these moves .
thus , the conflict in Ukraine has been framed as a renewed struggle against fascism – and in defense of Russia ’ s true , anti-Western identity . the supposed threat to Russia today was underscored for the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II , with billboards springing up across Moscow to remind Russians of the sacrifices that victory required .
this is why Surkov portrays Putin , who recently divorced his wife of 30 years and is rumored to have fathered several children with a former Olympic gymnast , as an avatar of conservative values , with the Orthodox Patriarch constantly at his side . the Kremlin ’ s campaign against gay rights has secured the support of the church , while reminding ordinary Russians that the state takes a watchful interest in their lives .
Western values may be under assault , but Western goods are welcome . a common sight in Russia is a shiny German-made car with a bumper sticker recalling the glories of World War II : “ On to Berlin ” or “ Thank you , grandfather , for the victory , and grandmother for the tough bullets . ”
last month , the Kremlin warned the country ’ s citizens that the United States was “ hunting ” Russians abroad . a few Russians have indeed been arrested and extradited to the US : the arms dealer Viktor Bout , for example , who is charged with providing aid to terrorists , or the hacker Vladimir Drinkman , who is accused of stealing millions of credit card numbers .
rather than risking mockery with outlandish claims – a staple of Soviet propagandists – that Russia will one day surpass the West economically , Surkov taps a deeper and safer emotion : fear . whatever Russians think of the country ’ s economic malaise – GDP is expected to contract by 3.8 % this year , while inflation could top 15 % – they are assured that they would be much worse off without Putin .
a few years ago , it seemed that every tenth person wore a white ribbon , a symbol of protest against Putin . today , one gets the impression that every third Russian is wearing the Ribbon of Saint George , an orange and black symbol of patriotism and loyalty to the Kremlin .
it is an insidious and effective strategy , one that marginalizes dissenters and generates the impression of near-universal support for the regime . on my last visit to Moscow , I noticed that a friend , a singer in the Bolshoi opera , had tied a small Ribbon of Saint George to her white Mercedes .
it is through small surrenders like hers that men like Surkov ultimately succeed . citizens pretending to be loyal build a culture of conformity .
the Middle East ’ s Three Timelines
Berlin – Three distinct timelines are shaping developments in the Middle East : the short-term timeline of daily struggles and politics ; the medium-term timeline of geopolitical shifts , which is measured in decades ; and the long-term timeline of sociocultural transformation , or what the historian Fernand Braudel called the longue durée . understanding each is essential to craft an effective strategy in the region .
the first timeline certainly receives the most attention . the media report relentlessly on the latest round of fighting between Israel and Hamas ; recent negotiations over Iran ’ s nuclear program ; ongoing opposition activity and political repression in Egypt and Bahrain ; and the slaughter and humanitarian tragedies unfolding in Syria and Iraq .
but political thinking in the Middle East is often linked to the second timeline . indeed , it is impossible to grasp the region ’ s contemporary history and politics without understanding the emergence of the regional state system after World War I and the demise of the Ottoman Empire .
for example , there are the constant reminders that external powers – most notably , the United Kingdom and France – established the existing borders . resistance against the so-called Sykes-Picot order nurtured the founding myths of many states and political movements in the region .
the border between Iraq and Syria is evaporating , as the Sunni militants of the Islamic State capture a widening swath of territory . and the rise of Kurdish military forces against them raises the possibility that a full-fledged Kurdish state will eventually emerge .
meanwhile , the tenuous status quo in Israel and Palestine is crumbling . with a two-state solution less likely than ever , the area is likely to experience the creeping consolidation of a one-state reality .
in the Persian Gulf , ongoing international negotiations over Iran ’ s nuclear program are but the latest chapter in a struggle over strategic hegemony , security , and economic interests . and , though the world ’ s appetite for energy resources from the Gulf will not diminish anytime soon , the structure of influence may be set to change again .
when it comes to external power brokers , the United States plays the largest role , having replaced Great Britain by the 1970s . it now must learn to cope with the growing influence of India and China , as well .
but it is the leading regional powers – Iran and Saudi Arabia – that have the greatest potential to transform the Middle East . the question is whether they will continue their competition for regional dominance , regardless of its destabilizing impact , or become pillars of a new regional security structure .
such a structure has become all the more important as the major external powers ’ appetite for sustained involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts wanes . having learned the hard way that they cannot dictate regional political outcomes , Western powers – as well as Russia , China , and India – will likely limit their involvement to protecting their direct interests and , if necessary , containing regional threats .
wherever the political and socioeconomic conditions of the short- and medium-term timelines fail to provide order and stability , the confessional , ethnic , or tribal identities that emerged over the longue durée gain prominence . the extent to which identities are invented matters little , as long as their invocation helps to appropriate elements of history and harness them to current political goals .
the conflict over the succession of religious leadership following the death of the Prophet Muhammad nearly 1,400 years ago is the origin of the split between Sunni and Shia Islam . the battles between the Fatimids and the Abbasids , the Crusades , the Mongol invasion , the Ottoman conquest , and , of course , Western imperialism all serve as points of reference for today ’ s struggles .
consider the Islamic State ’ s recent declaration of a caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria . most Sunnis are outraged by the brutal behavior of the Islamic State ’ s self-appointed caliph , Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , and consider his claim that he will eventually “ conquer Rome ” ridiculous .
navigating this narrative can be tricky for external actors . they must neither ignore the longue durée nor believe misleading claims that the struggle is really over the legitimacy of opposing interpretations of the faith .
more generally , these actors ’ actions in the region must never be shaped by the delusion that the Sunnis , Shia , or any other ethnic or religious minority is on their side . one lesson common to all of the Middle Eastern timelines is that all local actors are on their own side – and more than willing to draw foreigners into their wars if doing so fortifies them against their enemies .
Syria ’ s No-Solution Solution
as a practical matter , efforts to verify , secure , and eventually destroy Syria ’ s huge supply of chemical weapons cannot be implemented without at least a lasting ceasefire . but synchronizing the two processes is necessary for other reasons , too .
aside from the human suffering caused by Syria ’ s ongoing war , we should be aware of the potentially dire regional consequences . some people now warn of a “ Lebanonization ” of Syria – partition of the country into rival fiefdoms and quasi-independent regions .
unlike Lebanon during its 15-year civil war , no regional power today would be able to contain Syria ’ s war within its borders . as a result , it is much more likely that Syria ’ s disintegration would call the entire post-World War I ( or post-Ottoman ) Middle Eastern state system – also called the “ Sykes-Picot ” system – into question .
Lebanon ’ s established political contours already are beginning to blur under the relentless pressure of the Syrian conflict . a zone of de facto control by Lebanon ’ s Hezbollah and Syrian regime forces has emerged between Baalbek and Homs , straddling the Lebanese-Syrian border .
since the fall of Saddam Hussein , the Kurdistan Regional Government ( KRG ) in northern Iraq has effectively established de facto autonomy vis-à-vis the central government in Baghdad . regional and domestic developments could push the Kurdish authorities in Erbil , their capital , toward declaring formal independence .
indeed , the KRG government has long made clear that it respects Turkish sovereignty and will not interfere with relations between Turkey ’ s government and its own Kurdish population . and , if only for its own security , the KRG is attempting to extend its power , formally or informally , into northern Syria .
from Turkey ’ s perspective , a confederation of Syria ’ s northeastern region with the KRG might be favorable to continuing domestic Kurdish unrest , much less rule by the anti-Turkish Kurdish Workers Party ( PKK ) along its border with Syria . in contrast , any attempt by the KRG to establish a Kurdish corridor to the Mediterranean would certainly meet resistance , not only from Turkey , but also from other warring factions in Syria .
this is not only a question of territory , borders , and oil , but also one that concerns the domestic balance of power . with a Kurdish exit removing the third constituent element – besides Shia and Sunni Arabs – of Iraqi politics , the country ’ s sectarian polarization would most likely deepen .
moreover , Kurdish independence could encourage demands for autonomy in the Sunni-majority provinces bordering Syria , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia – a third region where Syria ’ s civil war is blurring international borders . social , tribal , and economic ties between the provinces of Deir al-Zour in Syria and Anbar in Iraq are strong and have strengthened further as control by the Syrian and Iraqi governments has loosened .
it is astonishing how many regional observers seem to expect , hope , or fear that such developments will somehow lead , almost automatically , to a “ new Sykes-Picot ” – that is , to the establishment of a new regional order in the Middle East created by today ’ s great powers . ( a Google search for “ new Sykes Picot ” in Arabic brings 52,600 hits . )
rather than pondering or devising new borders , regional and external powers need to focus their efforts on holding Syria together . the planned Geneva II conference is a necessary first step .
indeed , no one – not Russia , the US , Iran , Saudi Arabia , or other external patrons of either the regime or the opposition – can guarantee that Geneva II will succeed . but all of them could improve conditions for negotiations by sending the same message to their respective Syrian clients , namely that they henceforth exclude a military victory by one side over the other .
thus , Russia and Iran will have to tell Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that they will not support his effort to seek a military victory . Saudi Arabia , the US , Turkey , and others will have to tell the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces that it will not win on the battlefield ; the Salafists must hear this message from Saudi Arabia , too .
this would be a strong incentive to go to Geneva . warring parties start to negotiate seriously only if and when they know that other alternatives are out of reach .
Europe in a Multipolar World
though the West , along with Japan , may view the crisis as a challenge to the global order , most other states do not feel threatened by Russia ’ s annexation of Crimea or designs it may have elsewhere in Ukraine . instead , many view this crisis as being largely about Europe ’ s inability to resolve its own regional disputes – though a successful outcome could bolster Europe ’ s global influence as a peacemaker .
as the Ukraine crisis unfolded , Russian policymakers and commentators talked about “ the end of the Post-Cold War era , ” while Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dimitri Rogozin even appeared to welcome the start of a New Cold War . such wishful thinking is predicated on the notion that conflict between Russia and the West would once again come to define the entire international system , thereby returning Russia to its former superpower status .
as emerging powers ’ reactions to the Ukraine crisis demonstrate , world politics is no longer defined by what happens in Europe , even when a major conflict is brewing there . the international system has become so multi-polar that non-European states can now choose to follow their own interests rather than feel obliged to side with the East or the West .
few world leaders doubt that Russia ’ s use of force to compromise Ukraine ’ s territorial integrity , change its borders , and annex Crimea violated international law . China ’ s abstention in the subsequent United Nations Security Council vote clearly signaled its leaders ’ displeasure with Kremlin policy .
even Western-friendly governments – including Brazil , India , South Africa , and Israel – were not prepared to take sides . the Indian journalist Indrani Bagchi referred to the abstentions as a new form of non-alignment .
cynicism and schadenfreude may also be playing a role . Raja Mohan , a prominent Indian strategist , notes that Europe “ has never ceased to lecture Asia on the virtues of regionalism , ” but now seems unable to cope with its own regional security challenges .
the implicit message from the new non-aligned is straightforward : why should we care about a territorial conflict in Europe when you Europeans fail to act decisively on Palestine , Kashmir , or territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas ? instead , many of these countries are calling on the West to de-escalate the crisis and , as an official Chinese foreign-ministry statement advocated , to “ exercise restraint and refrain from raising tensions . ”
that is good advice – and no different from what Europeans tell others in similar situations . unlike other regions of the world , however , Europe , including Russia , can be proud of its regional security organizations , such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) ;
the OSCE , for example , would be greatly strengthened if , using its wide range of diplomatic mechanisms ( such as roundtable discussions and support for constitutional reforms ) , it succeeded in defusing the Ukraine crisis and thereby bolstered European security . doing so would also provide a powerful example of institutionalized regionalism that might serve as a conflict-resolution model for other countries .
Alternatively , if Europe is unable to resolve the Ukraine crisis with diplomacy , its global influence , and that of Russia , will surely fade . Russia has reminded the world that it is possible to bully one ’ s neighbors and steal their territory using brute force ; but , in a globalized , multi-polar system , this alone will not be enough to rally other countries to its cause .
the Ukraine crisis is therefore both a challenge and an opportunity . if Europe wants to remain a pole in a multi-polar international system , it must prove that it can pursue a common foreign and security policy , particularly in times of crisis and conflict .
that means that the EU must emerge from the Ukraine crisis with a stronger commitment to common defense and joint contingency planning , and a unified energy policy that can secure independence from Russian oil and gas . but Europe must also show that it can , and will , defend the principles of rules-based international relations .
maintaining and strengthening the pillars of Europe ’ s common defense is not a simple task ; but multilateral security organizations like the OSCE are not made for easy times . they are intended to protect members from manipulation and aggression , and in a way that can garner global support .
a Syrian Farewell to Arms
Berlin – The Geneva II conference on Syria , set to begin in Montreux , Switzerland , on January 22 , is unlikely to achieve its goal of forming a transitional governing authority with full executive powers . but what it can do is launch a much-needed political process and , more important , produce a ceasefire agreement between government and opposition forces .
of course , Al Qaeda-linked jihadist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) , which has become a potent force on the ground , and the Nusra Front will not and should not be represented in Montreux – not least because they will not feel bound by any agreement . but this should not serve as an excuse not to pursue a ceasefire .
a ceasefire is critical , because the fighting serves the interests of the most brutal elements on both sides of the conflict . this includes the core leadership of President Bashar al-Assad ’ s regime , which is now supported by Hezbollah and Iraqi militias , as much as the ISIS , which is composed largely of non-Syrian fighters who are unconcerned about rebuilding the country or safeguarding its people ’ s future .
as in any civil war , such entrepreneurs of violence become increasingly likely to carry the day the longer the conflict endures . they feed on their own atrocities or on those of their opponents to win support through fear rather than conviction – using videos to raise funds and recruit new members .
with skilled fighters and plenty of money and arms , the ISIS and the Nusra Front thrive amid persistent war and anarchy . meanwhile , the Assad regime benefits from the fact that parts of the country that it no longer controls cannot be called “ liberated zones , ” given the prevailing chaos and extremism in these areas .
a ceasefire would initiate a shift in this dynamic , allowing humanitarian supplies to reach the areas where they are needed most urgently , while halting the country ’ s gradual “ Somalization . ” This would help to stem the flow of refugees – and the spillover of violence – to neighboring countries , particularly Lebanon and Iraq .
the problem is that , as long as violence prevents moderate forces from restoring local services and administrative structures , people ’ s capacity for resistance will remain weak . international organizations could treat such structures as de facto authorities , supplying them directly with aid and also giving NGOs or United Nations investigators an opportunity to collect evidence of war crimes for future judicial or truth-commission proceedings .
to be sure , fears that a ceasefire could lead to a stabilization of the conflict ’ s frontlines , turning them into semi-permanent lines of division , are not without merit . after all , a ceasefire is not a peace agreement ; it would , for the time being , leave regime and opposition forces in their respective positions .
moreover , a ceasefire would enable the FSA and its allies to coordinate action with units of the regular army against Al Qaeda bands , which would undoubtedly try to sustain the violence . even such limited cooperation would advance the “ Geneva process ” – especially negotiations aimed at establishing a transitional authority that would command the armed forces .
responsibility for convincing Assad to stop bombing and shelling opposition-held areas would fall primarily on his international allies , Russia and Iran . in doing so , they should bear in mind that it was Assad who led the country into civil war by choosing a military solution when high-level members of his own government and political party argued for a negotiated settlement .
neither Russia nor Iran has an interest in prolonging a war that is destabilizing the Middle East and fostering the spread of Al Qaeda-style extremism . indeed , both have already helped to bring the Syrian regime to Geneva .
waiting for Obama
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) summit in Thailand in late October brought all the key players of Asia together . come mid-November , almost all of them will meet again in Singapore at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit , which will include other Pacific leaders , plus US President Barack Obama .
summits are a circus with many rings and acronyms . at the ASEAN summit , the 10 Southeast Asian leaders met counterparts from China , Japan , and South Korea . these 13 countries then met again with India , Australia , and New Zealand .
some 42 agreements were reportedly penned at the meeting , on issues ranging from outstanding trade and economic matters to the launch of a human rights commission . not bad for a summit that some feared would not happen at all : an earlier meeting planned for April in Bangkok had been disrupted by protesters – “ red shirts ” who support ousted Thai premier Thaksin Shinawatra .
as for Obama , he will first visit Japan , and , while at APEC , will also attend the first US-ASEAN Summit . afterwards , he will go to China and South Korea .
Obama is still fighting back home for his healthcare initiative , and is hamstrung from acting on climate change in time for the Copenhagen summit , which is to agree on a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol . so there is a risk that he will come to Asia for just a star turn and photo opportunities while reserving his strength for other battles .
starting with Japan , Obama needs to ensure a good working relationship with Yukio Hatoyama , the new premier . Japan has voiced support for an East Asian community that includes India , Australia , and New Zealand , while the Chinese and others question widening the circle .
moving onto ASEAN , much attention will be on how Obama interacts with Myanmar ’ s leader , who will also be present . Obama should stand for democracy and help push for a clean vote in the elections that the junta has promised for 2010 .
ASEAN has been the hub for Asian regionalism , but some in Australia have proposed focusing only on the larger countries . Southeast Asians have a renewed openness towards American leadership , and meaningful initiatives can be started that would resonate with regional aspirations .
US Senator Richard Lugar has floated the idea of a free-trade agreement between the US and ASEAN . but , with Myanmar included , this may be too difficult politically , and an ASEAN sub-grouping may be more realistic .
in this time of crisis and unemployment , the American public may question freer trade . but more and more American businesses realize that still-growing Asian markets are vital for their future profits and overall economic recovery .
most economic frameworks are among Asians only , but an American initiative could trump them and ensure that the region remains open and engaged with the US . it could also help lessen the tendency of some governments to gravitate ever closer towards the booming Chinese economy .
on the economic crisis , climate change , and many other global issues , China and the US are potentially the decisive actors . but the US must also engage in a more multilateral way to include Southeast Asia ’ s smaller countries .
but , despite the rivalries and all the chatter , it is clear that Asians are coming closer together . and , while Asian regionalism is messy and rife with tensions and flash points , the US has been the stabilizing power in the region .
Obama has the opportunity to ensure that the region continues to see the US as the essential actor – now more open and helpful than before . if he achieves this , Obama ’ s long trip will be valuable for Americans , and Asians will realize that it was worth waiting for him .
Wall-to-Wall Wal-Mart ?
in a scenario that looks uncannily like the spread of a global pandemic , the economist Thomas Holmes has prepared a dynamic map simulation showing the spread of Wal-Mart stores throughout the United States . starting at the epicenter in Bentonville , Arkansas , where Sam Walton opened his first store in 1962 , giant boxy Wal-Mart stores have now multiplied to the point where the average American lives less than seven kilometers from an outlet .
rather than jumping out to the coasts – 80 % of all Americans live within 80 kilometers of the Pacific or Atlantic oceans – Wal-Marts have spread organically through an ever-expanding supply chain . even though each new store takes away business from Wal-Mart stores established nearby , ever-improving supply efficiencies help maintain the chain ’ s overall growth .
love them or hate them , what is undeniable is that Wal-Mart is the quintessential example of the costs and benefits of modern globalization . consumers pay significantly less than at traditional outlets .
consider the following stunning fact : together with a few sister “ big box ” stores ( Target , Best Buy , and Home Depot ) , Wal-Mart accounts for roughly 50 % of America ’ s much vaunted productivity growth edge over Europe during the last decade . fifty percent !
they are an enormous boon to low-income consumers , partly compensating for the tepid wage growth that many of them have suffered during the past two decades . and I don ’ t agree with friends of mine who turn their noses down at Wal-Mart stores , and claim never to have visited one .
while completely legal , studies suggest that Wal-Mart ’ s labor policies exploit regulatory loopholes that , for example , allow it to sidestep the burden of healthcare costs for many workers ( Wal-Mart provides healthcare coverage to less than half its workers ) . and the entry of big-box stores into a community crushes long-established retailers , often traumatically transforming their character .
big-box stores are not exactly attractive – hence their name . if they continue their explosive growth over the next 20 years , will Americans someday come to regard their proliferation as a spectacular example of the failure to adopt region-wide blueprints for balanced growth ?
the French may have invented the hyper mart – the forerunner of the big-box store – but they never intended to let their growth go unchecked . the big question for Europeans is whether they can find ways to exploit some of the efficiency gains embodied by the Wal-Mart model without being overrun by it .
they are not quite the pandemic that their explosive growth pattern resembles , but nor is their emergence completely benign . those who would aim to emulate US productivity trends must come to grips with how they feel about big-box stores sprouting across their countryside ’ s , driving down wages and plowing under smaller-scale retailers .
shaking Up “ Shaken Baby Syndrome ”
Oxford – The most tragic event that can befall new parents is the sudden , unexpected death of their baby . perhaps the only thing worse is the parents being wrongly accused of causing the death , and indeed prosecuted , owing to the medical community ’ s misinterpretation of the findings .
a small number of babies who collapse and die unexpectedly in their first year are found to have one or more of the following three symptoms in common : bleeding just outside the brain ( subdural hemorrhage ) ; bleeding at the back of the eye ( retinal hemorrhage ) ; and brain swelling .
these same features are also seen in some babies who have suffered trauma , such as falls or motor-vehicle accidents . yet many babies with these symptoms have no history or medical evidence of trauma ( such as fractures , abrasions , or bruises ) , physical abuse , or neglect .
Pediatricians wrestled with this conundrum until the 1970 ’ s , when it was proposed that shaking might induce rotational forces and cause the “ triad ” of symptoms without bruises or fractures . over the years , these findings evolved into “ shaken baby syndrome ” ( SBS ) , a medico-legal hypothesis that remains contentious , and scientifically unproven , to this day .
it was suggested that these outcomes required a force equivalent to a multi-story fall or major motor-vehicle accident , causing immediate symptoms or collapse . because violent shaking cannot be accidental , the hypothesis simultaneously established a criminal act and identified the perpetrator , typically the person with the baby at the time of collapse .
though the SBS hypothesis was incorporated into medical training and judicial decisions worldwide , it remained untested for almost two decades . in 1987 , the first biomechanical experiments found that the force of shaking is much less than that of impact and concluded that shaking alone was unlikely to cause the triad of symptoms .
we learned that the brain damage in these children did not reflect trauma to nerve fibers , but rather a failure of blood supply . we also learned that the typical subdural hemorrhages in these cases are too thin to result from the rupture of the large bridging veins on the brain ’ s surface .
perhaps the most compelling observation in recent years is that subdural hemorrhages are present in nearly half of normal , healthy newborns with no evidence of birth trauma . these findings , combined with the immature anatomy of the infant dura , suggest that dural bleeding in young babies may be a natural protective device – a reservoir to prevent backflow into the brain ’ s blood vessels during the pressure fluctuations of normal labor and delivery .
because these anatomical features persist into early childhood , the dura may remain similarly vulnerable to bleeding beyond the newborn period . indeed , both birth-related bleeds and those attributed to shaking are most often located in the folds of membranes covering the brain that have more and larger blood vessels at this age than later in life .
while scientific evidence over the last three decades has undermined the shaken baby hypothesis , no new evidence has emerged to support it . instead , several researchers have relied upon the data in older studies to calculate the statistical probability of inflicted brain injury when certain features ( such as intracranial hemorrhage , retinal hemorrhage , brain swelling , and seizures ) are present .
however , the reasoning behind the studies on which these researchers rely is circular , and based on assumptions now known to be unreliable . for example , in some studies , the researchers decided arbitrarily that falls of less than one meter could not harm a baby , so that parents who described such a fall must be lying .
given these flaws , reviews of old studies do not provide a reliable evidence base for diagnosing abuse . they simply predict the likelihood that specific findings will be categorized as abusive , and that , consequently , the child ’ s caregiver at the time will be accused or convicted of abuse , regardless of the accuracy of the diagnosis .
the real issue is whether shaking or abuse can be inferred on the basis of a hypothesis that lacks scientific support . in no other area of medicine and law would an unproved hypothesis provide a basis for diagnosis , let alone criminal prosecution .
given the developments of the past decade , we now face the possibility that for the past 30 years we have been wrongly imprisoning parents on the basis of a flawed hypothesis .
China ’ s North Korean Pivot
Beijing – After a spring of heightened tension on the Korean Peninsula , a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks has brought some hope of a meeting of the minds , at least between China , South Korea , and the United States . but the emergence of a viable consensus on how to minimize the security risks emanating from North Korea ’ s mercurial leadership remains to be found .
after a reportedly tough meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Vice Marshall Choe Ryong-hae , one of the four members of North Korea ’ s ruling presidium , the US-China summit in California took place with North Korea as one of the central points of discussion . this was quickly followed by a Beijing summit between Xi and South Korean President Park Geun-hye .
China ’ s interest in a new North Korea policy is not entirely new . after all , China ’ s policy toward the country has been gradually moving in a more constructive direction for the past two decades , reflecting China ’ s growing international prominence , as well as its leaders ’ cautious embrace of the global role that their country ’ s new economic might has provided .
in the immediate post-Cold War period , China cooperated with other concerned parties in the process of resolving the first North Korea nuclear crisis of 1993-1994 ; but it tended to regard the North ’ s nuclear ambitions mainly as a bilateral issue between North Korea and the US . President Bill Clinton seemed to agree , and adopted a bilateral approach to the nuclear crisis , which resulted in the two countries ’ Agreed Framework of 1994 .
but China ’ s leaders balked , circumscribing their role severely . though Chinese leaders became more active by hosting the six-party talks , they still regarded their role as that of mediator between the US and the North , rather than that of a party whose security interests were seriously affected by events on the Korean Peninsula .
immediately after the North ’ s second nuclear test in 2009 , Chinese officials undertook a review of their country ’ s North Korea policy and decided to separate the nuclear issue from the overall bilateral relationship . thus , former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao visited Pyongyang in October 2009 and promised generous economic aid .
but the big problem was that the North ’ s leadership apparently interpreted China ’ s policy as a sign of unwillingness to pressure the North on nuclear matters . indeed , North Korean behavior became much more provocative , including an attack in 2010 that sank the South Korean corvette Cheonan and another in which the South ’ s Yeonpyeong Island was shelled .
following this spring ’ s round of North Korean provocations , Xi appears to have concluded that enough is enough . as a result , China ’ s North Korea policy has entered a new stage .
Chinese leaders may still view North Korea as a strategic buffer state , but China ’ s status as a global power is pushing them to view the North in a new way . former State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan was even reported to have said recently that denuclearization is now a higher priority for China than stabilization of the Korean Peninsula .
if the US and China are to avoid being steered by North Korea onto a collision course , they probably have four or five years to pursue a joint strategy – a timetable established by the point at which North Korea could have the technology to load miniaturized nuclear warheads atop long-range missiles .
as the North approaches this point , the US will have to strengthen its missile defenses in the western Pacific – areas close to China – in order to deter the North Korean threat . the result , invariably , will be heightened Sino-US tension .
those improved ties matter , because the time has come for China to rebalance its traditional geostrategic interests with its role as a global leader . that calls for a Chinese policy of disciplined engagement toward North Korea , without which an internationally coordinated solution to the nuclear problem – and , with it , the promise of more productive relations with the US and South Korea – will be impossible .
wanted : an Arab Jean Monnet
the next war , terrorist attack , or failed peace initiative may lurk just around the corner . compared to the politics of this region , a rollercoaster ride is downright calming .
and yet the Middle East is also a region that , throughout its innumerable conflicts , has hardly changed , languishing in a strange kind of standstill . there must be an intrinsic correlation between the lack of developmental dynamism of most Middle Eastern societies and the fact that the region is so crisis-prone .
the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians stands out as an example of the static nature of this key geopolitical region , because it seems to be completely unaffected by any international upheaval . the Ottomans , the British , decolonization , the Cold War , numerous American Presidents , and even more international mediators have come and gone , but the parameters of this conflict and the inability to find a solution never seem to change .
however , this impression – correct where the past is concerned – might prove deceptive in the future , because two global megatrends will subject the region to more profound change than all the many previous political crises and wars were able to bring about .
the first is globalization , by which ever-larger parts of the Arab world , beginning with the Persian Gulf and its oil countries , will be influenced , albeit slowly , both economically and culturally .
with the shift of wealth and power from the West to the East , the pressures of globalization will increasingly come from the East . in Morocco , for instance , investment from the Arab oil countries has already significantly reduced Europe ’ s importance .
the inherent contradiction between a governance structure incapable of change and economic modernization , between cultural and religious conservatism and social and normative transformation , will therefore increase and bring about new , additional frictions if positive answers to these fundamental changes cannot be found .
apart from those countries that are threatened – partly or completely – by rising sea levels , global warming will primarily affect the desert belts and their already precarious water supplies . and , while the conflicts in the Middle East are primarily about territory , this includes the scarce water resources so essential for survival .
rapid population growth , a dramatic increase in water consumption due to industrial , agricultural , and tourism growth , and rising standards of living will make the water issue even more important to the region ’ s political stability than it is already .
a sustainable answer to questions of such vital importance to the Middle East only makes sense if it is regional in character . and the same applies to the increasing demand for energy : although the region as a whole is rich in energy resources , their uneven geographical distribution suggests that any viable solution must be built on cooperation .
of course , resolving the political crises and conflicts remains the top priority . to make regional peace and stability possible , however , the region ’ s very young and rapidly increasing populations require an economic perspective that makes their participation in globalization possible – in a dignified manner and grounded in their own culture and history .
the Middle East ’ s individual states won ’ t be able to manage this without regional cooperation . the European Union ’ s successful track record could therefore provide an almost perfect model .
in fact , the preconditions for intra-regional cooperation – up to partial integration of the interests of the countries involved – look more auspicious than they did in Western Europe in the early 1950 ’ s . Europe had neither a common language , nor was it as religiously and culturally as homogeneous as the Middle East .
for Europe , the starting point was visionary leaders like Jean Monnet and the creation of new institutions like the Coal and Steel Community . in the Middle East , the process of regional integration could begin with water and energy .
this would , finally , give the Middle East – a region poor in growth and rich in conflicts – a distinct identity , making it a player in global economic terms as well , and thus enabling it to become the architect of its own future .
and Europe can help the Middle East – its neighboring region – achieve this strategic objective . an instrument for it already exists : the new Union for the Mediterranean .
in any case , the time of standstill in the Middle East is coming to an end . whether the consequences of this development will be good or bad depends on whether the region can muster the foresight and strength actively to shape this process .
Washington and the Art of the Possible
Chicago – These days , the United States media are full of ordinary Americans venting their rage at the incompetence and immaturity of their politicians . even though the US government ’ s debt limit was raised in the nick of time , the process was – and remains – fraught with risk .
the absence of broad consensus is no wonder . indeed , the last-minute agreement to raise the debt ceiling is proof that the politicians did what they were sent to Washington to do : represent their constituencies and only compromise in the interests of the country as a whole .
the key question is whether the political gridlock exposed by the debt-ceiling debate will worsen in the run-up to the 2012 presidential and congressional elections – if not beyond . that is possible , but we should not overlook cause for hope in what America ’ s politicians just accomplished .
income inequality has been growing in the US over the last three decades , largely because the labor market has increasingly demanded skills that the education system has been unable to supply . the everyday consequence for the middle class is a stagnant paycheck and growing employment insecurity , as the old economy of well-paying low-skilled jobs with good benefits withers away .
with the collapse of the housing bubble , many people lost their jobs and health insurance , risked losing their homes , and suddenly had little reason for economic optimism . the response from America ’ s Democratic Party , which has traditionally represented this constituency , was to promise affordable universal health care and more education spending , while also protecting government jobs and entitlement programs .
but the rich are not the idle rich of the past ; they are the working rich . to balance the budget only by taxing the rich will require a significant increase in income taxes , to the point that it would lower incentives for work and entrepreneurial activity considerably .
this is not to say that taxes on the rich cannot be increased at all ; but such increases cannot be the primary way of balancing the budget . Republicans , trying to give voice to many working Americans ’ ambient uneasiness with rising government expenditures , as well as to the growing anger of the working rich , find it easier to defend a principle than a particular constituency .
it is understandable that older Americans who have few savings want to protect their Social Security and Medicare benefits . however , even elderly Tea Party Republicans , who are typically against big government , defend these programs because they view them as a form of property right , paid for when they worked .
in truth , rising life expectancy and growing health-care costs mean that today ’ s elderly have contributed only a fraction of what they expect to receive from Social Security and Medicare . the government made a mistake in the past by not raising taxes to finance these programs or reducing the benefits that they promised .
but the elderly are politically active and powerful . not only do many defend their entitlements strongly ; some oppose growth in other types of public spending for fear that it will weaken the government ’ s ability to pay for the benefits that they believe they are owed .
any political deal significantly before the debt-ceiling deadline would have exposed politicians to charges of betrayal from their constituents . and , given that President Barack Obama would ultimately be held responsible for a default , he needed the deal more than the Republicans did .
will the deal deliver what it promises ? a bipartisan committee has to propose $ 1.5 trillion in deficit reduction by the end of this year , and Congress must either accept that proposal , or see immediate , politically painful expenditure cuts , which would include defense spending – an area that America ’ s Republicans care about strongly .
if this structure works as advertised , Congress will be forced to reach a compromise , which can be sold once again by politicians to their polarized constituencies as being necessary to avoid a worse outcome . this time , Obama ’ s Democrats will be on a level playing field , because both parties will be held equally responsible for a failure to reach a deal .
ultimately , the big necessary decisions on curbing entitlement growth and reforming the tax code will probably have to wait until after the next election , giving the divided electorate an opportunity to reflect on its own inconsistency and send a clearer message . in the meantime , US politicians might have done just about enough to convince debt markets that America ’ s credit is still good .
was Killing Bin Laden a Mistake ?
London – “ He lived a hero , he died a martyr ... if they killed one Osama , a thousand others will be born , ” says a comment on a Facebook group called “ We are all Osama bin Laden . ” The group was formed one hour after US President Barack Obama ’ s announcement of the Al Qaeda leader ’ s death .
some view the man considered a mass murderer in the West as an icon , and his death and burial at sea at the hands of American forces will not undermine that perception in the eyes of his sympathizers . indeed , Egypt ’ s former Mufti , Sheikh Nasr Farid Wasil , has already declared Bin Laden a martyr , “ because he was killed by the hands of the enemy . ”
aside from the mixed signals online , in the virtual world , the critical question is whether eliminating Bin Laden marks the beginning of Al Qaeda ’ s demise in reality . some terrorist organizations have , of course , collapsed following the death of their charismatic leader .
by contrast , far from causing the demise of an armed movement , the killing of a charismatic leader at the hands of his enemies can transform such a figure into a martyr . Che Guevera was far more valuable to leftist militancy after his death than he was while alive .
armed Islamism has its particularities , of course , but it also shares important characteristics with some of these groups , including the relationship between the physical elimination of a leader and organizational survival . decentralized organizations with relevant ideologies , operating in contexts full of conditions conducive to armed action , usually survive leadership losses , whereas hierarchical , cult-like organizations often do not .
Abu Musab al-Zaraqawi ’ s Al Qaeda offshoot in Iraq demonstrates this well : the group was called Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia for recruitment and propaganda purposes , but it was quite autonomous organizationally and operationally . when Bin Laden ’ s close collaborator Ayman al-Zawahiri asked al-Zaraqawi to avoid targeting Shiites , al-Zaraqawi instead escalated the violence against them .
Al Qaeda ’ s franchise model applies to Algeria , Yemen , North Mali , and Somalia as well . and , like guerrilla movements of yore , Al Qaeda partakes of “ ideological front ” tactics : small urban cells and / or vulnerable individuals subscribe to the ideology and self-recruit or self-start an affiliated cell .
in all of its decentralized modes of operation , Bin Laden mainly played the role of inspirational guide and iconic figurehead – a role better played when dead by American guns than alive , hiding from them .
of the 98 fellow Muslim Brotherhood prisoners with whom Qutb discussed his new confrontational ideology in 1964 , 35 were strongly supportive , 23 strongly opposed , and 50 hesitant . despite his intellectual status and prestige , Qutb had failed to persuade the majority of like-minded inmates under conditions of repression .
his supporters soon numbered in the thousands , rather than the dozens , and he came to inspire generations , not just individual inmates . moreover , Qutb was executed by an Arab Nationalist Muslim leader , whereas Bin Laden was killed by US Navy Seals .
imprisonment , followed by recantation of violence , has become almost a trend in several jihadist groups , notably the 20,000-strong Egyptian Islamic Group , factions of the al-Jihad Organization in Egypt , and smaller groups like the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group . leading figures in armed Islamist movements have not only abandoned political violence , but have also de-legitimized it as a means for social and political change after spending periods in prison .
eliminating the “ spiritual guide ” ( as opposed to the organizational leaders ) of a militant group might be perceived as a political victory for a government in the short term , but it probably makes a comprehensive de-radicalization process less likely , and it will not necessarily mean the end of the organization in question . for long-term results , capture is almost always more effective than killing .
wasting Food in a Hungry World
Ottawa – One-quarter of all the food in the world is lost each year , owing to inefficient harvesting , inadequate storage , and wastage in the kitchen . halve that waste , and the world could feed an extra billion people – and make hunger yesterday ’ s problem .
the extent of food loss is particularly galling in view of a new global study on food security from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization . according to the FAO , 57 developing countries have failed to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving the proportion of hungry people by this year .
of course , there has also been remarkable progress : over the last 25 years , the world has fed an extra two billion people , and – for all the 57 failures – the developing world as a whole has almost halved its hunger rate . but the challenge is to sustain the progress : by 2050 , demand for food will have nearly doubled .
at the moment , the UN is considering 169 new development targets to succeed the Millennium Development Goals ( hunger is one target area , among many ) . these targets are vitally important , because they will determine how more than $ 2.5 trillion in development money is spent on everything from climate change to malaria .
my think tank , the Copenhagen Consensus Center , therefore asked 60 teams of top economists to assess which proposed targets will do the most good – and which will not . our research on food security shows that there are smart ways to feed many more on the planet – but they have little to do with the campaigns against waste seen in most of the rich world .
in the rich world , the focus is on food wasted by the consumer . this makes sense : more than half of the rich world ’ s losses take place in its kitchens ( basically because we can afford it ) .
in Britain , for example , the greatest waste is in salads , vegetables , and fruits – luxuries when compared with the cheap calories contained in the grains and tubers consumed throughout the developing world . smaller households in rich countries waste more per person , because it is harder to put everything to use , while richer households add waste when they can afford to buy extra “ just to be on the safe side . ”
in Africa , daily food waste averages 500 calories per person – but consumers account for only 5 % of this loss . more than three-quarters of the waste occurs well before the kitchen , in inefficient agriculture , because birds and rats eat crops during harvest , for example , or pests spoil grain stores .
there are many remedies for this kind of waste – from the “ curing ” of roots and tubers to minimize damage , to more expensive refrigeration . so why aren ’ t these technologies – widely used in richer countries – adopted in the developing world ?
if there are no proper roads linking fields to markets , farmers cannot easily sell their surplus produce , which may then spoil before it can be eaten . improving road and rail capacity enables farmers to reach buyers – and fertilizer and other agricultural inputs to reach farmers .
economists from the International Food Policy Research Institute estimate that the overall cost of approximately halving post-harvest losses in the developing world would be $ 239 billion over the next 15 years – and would generate benefits worth more than $ 3 trillion , or $ 13 of social benefits for every dollar spent .
by 2050 , better infrastructure could mean that 57 million people – more than the current population of South Africa – would no longer be at risk of hunger , and that about four million children would no longer suffer from malnutrition . most of these gains would be in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia , the world ’ s most deprived regions .
but there is an even better investment . we can achieve three times the economic benefits , and even larger reductions in the number of people at risk of hunger , if we focus on improving food production rather than just on preventing food losses .
today , only $ 5 billion is spent annually on research to improve the seven major global food crops , and just one-tenth of that is targeted to help small farmers in Africa and Asia . investing an extra $ 88 billion in agricultural research and development over the next 15 years would increase yields by an additional 0.4 % each year .
that might not sound like very much , but the reduction in prices and improvements in food security would help almost everyone . it would be worth nearly $ 3 trillion in social good – yielding an enormous $ 34 of benefits for every dollar spent .
hunger is a complex problem , exacerbated by financial pressures , volatile commodity prices , natural disasters , and civil wars .
water for All
this month , water once again takes center stage at the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City . it is an opportune moment : while much of the world ’ s attention has been fixed on issues of energy supply and security , hundreds of millions of people in the developing world continue to see the supply and security of fresh water as equally , if not more , important .
surveys undertaken by the World Bank in developing countries show that , when poor people are asked to name the three most important concerns they face , “ good health ” is always mentioned . and a key determinant of whether they will have good health or not is access to clean water .
the World Bank estimates that by 2035 , as many as three billion people , almost all of them in developing countries , could live under conditions of severe water stress , especially if they happen to live in Africa , the Middle East , or South Asia . this will cause obvious hardship , but it will also hold back the economic growth needed for millions of people to escape poverty .
in Latin America , about 15 % of the population – roughly 76 million people – do not have access to safe water , and 116 million people do not have access to sanitation services . the figures are worse in Africa and parts of Asia .
generally , these countries ’ citizens enjoy services that provide for all water needs , from drinking to irrigation to sanitation . in addition , other water-related issues , such as the risks posed by flooding , have been reduced to manageable levels .
rich industrial countries have invested early and heavily in water infrastructure , institutions , and management capacities . the result , beyond the health benefits for all , has been a proven record of economic growth ; one only has to look at investment in hydropower to see the positive impact of water management projects on many economies .
granted , rich countries have a certain advantage : they benefit from generally moderate climates , with regular rainfall and relatively low risks of drought and flooding . even so , they are not immune to water-related disasters , as Hurricane Katrina ’ s destruction of New Orleans taught us .
extreme rainfall variations , floods , and droughts can have huge social and economic effects and result in the large-scale loss of life . the Gulf coast of Mexico and Central American countries has repeatedly experienced such tragedies , with poor communities the most vulnerable and the least able to cope .
Ethiopia ’ s development potential is closely tied to seasonal rains , so high rainfall variation , together with lack of infrastructure , has undermined growth and perpetuated poverty . a single drought can cut growth potential by 10 % over an extended period .
to move forward , developing countries need new water infrastructure and better management . any approach must be tailored to the circumstances of each country and the needs of its people , but there is no fundamental constraint to designing water development investments that ensure that local communities and the environment gain tangible and early benefits .
still others might need deeper reservoirs , more modern filtration plants , or improved water transport schemes . these can all potentially be designed to improve and expand water supplies for power generation , irrigation , and household and industrial use , while providing security against droughts and protection from floods .
badly managed infrastructure will do little to improve peoples ’ health or support economic growth , so water development and water management must go hand in hand . water infrastructure can and must be developed in parallel with sound institutions , good governance , great attention to the environment , and an equitable sharing of costs and benefits .
delegates to the World Water Forum will have ample opportunity to forge and / or strengthen these partnerships . if they succeed , the rewards for the world ’ s poor will be immense .
hard Wisdom for Scarce Water
the goal is to combat a severe drought by reducing residential consumption by 20 % . the trouble is that residential water use accounts for less than 15 % of total consumption .
meanwhile , in China , some 30,000 workers are trying to change the weather , attempting to seed clouds from airplanes or using anti-aircraft guns to shoot shells into the air , hoping to coax some rain from the sky . there is no statistical proof that this type of weather manipulation works , but cloud seeders are also busy in the United States , mainly in the west .
measures like those in California are like instructing police officers to blare their sirens wherever they drive to create the impression that crime is being fought . as climate change leads to deeper and more frequent droughts , the resulting water shortages will require new , sometimes difficult , solutions that go beyond futile attempts to placate the public .
in many places , underground water is considered the property of the owner of the land where the water is extracted , even when a well ’ s user is tapping an aquifer that spreads across thousands of square miles . as a result , there is little incentive to conserve .
in some parts of California and Texas , a portion of the water supply is provided to consumers for almost nothing – delivered by a network of dams , reservoirs , and aqueducts that were built decades ago . the Hoover Dam , for example , which created Lake Mead , the largest reservoir in the US , was built in 1936 during the Great Depression as part of the New Deal .
unlike other commodities , the price of water is very often a political decision , subject to the influence of interest groups that lobby for subsidies . for example , most of the water used in agriculture in Texas and California is sold at a price below its cost .
farmers in Texas and California need to stop growing rice , which should be imported from water-rich countries like Vietnam . instead , US farmers should be encouraged to shift to other crops , such as sesame , with the government sharing the cost of replacement machinery needed to cultivate and harvest them .
the water sector should follow the example of the electric-power industry , where changes to federal regulations in the second half of the twentieth century allowed independent power producers to use existing transmission lines . the deep price cuts and improved service ushered in by these regulatory changes prompted other countries to adopt the American model .
water Wars .
what is more vital for the future of humanity – and life in general – than water ? water abounds in nature , and most of humanity will have lived more than ten millenniums without ever wondering about it .
but we could very soon end up not having enough of the fresh water that accounts for just 3 % of all the water available on our planet . when one considers the fights we are capable of having over oil , one shudders to imagine where a lack of water could lead .
over the last 20 or 30 years we have begun to comprehend what is at stake , owing to initiatives like the World Water Forum , which held its fourth annual meeting in March . unfortunately , the Forum is not yet an official body and has no decision-making power .
water management is an inherently difficult challenge , and experience counts for a lot . practice shows that local levels of government provide the most efficient water management , even if regulations must necessarily be national in scope .
nor do most states seem prepared to start a real dialogue over water policy with civil society groups . at one extreme of exclusion , for example , consider that decisions about water management are largely taken by men , though in most of the world it is women who use the water .
the multiplicity of interlocutors inevitably creates a multiplicity of water systems with vastly unequal levels of efficiency . initiatives like the World Water Forums thus inevitably highlight debates about what constitutes good water management , as well as elaborating useful concepts .
water has a cost , and someone , either end-users or taxpayers , has to pay it . it is possible , of course , to envision sharing the costs , but it is no longer possible not to charge for water .
but the acknowledged responsibility of states in implementing the right to water cannot turn them into the sole paying authority . the state must be charged with ensuring an effective water system that meets the basic needs of all , but the balance of this system remains to be defined .
despite the political and administrative centralization of most of the countries represented at the Forum , there was widespread agreement that the most efficient water systems are managed as close as possible to the resource and its users . agreement on this provided a real breakthrough for the future of water policy .
inevitably , the cruel lack of means was pointed out time and again . and , unsurprisingly , the lack of solidarity among water haves and have-nots was openly on display at the Forum .
as we grapple with our joint water future , we will face a time of trial and error in finding workable solutions . but humanity already seems to be making more progress on matters related to drinking water than other global threats , such as climate change .
breakthrough Vaccines
new YORK – Vaccines are one of the great success stories in the history of individual and public health . they have helped rid the planet of the scourge of smallpox , are poised to eliminate polio , and each year prevent millions of deaths , reducing the suffering and costs caused by infectious diseases .
but there are still many diseases for which vaccines do not yet exist . moreover , strategies that have previously led to the successful development of vaccines are unlikely to work against more complex bacteria or viruses , such as HIV , which have evolved multiple mechanisms to evade the immune system .
the history of vaccinology is one in which biomedical and technological advances usher in the “ next generation ” of vaccines . in the 1950 ’ s , a breakthrough that enabled viruses to grow in tissue cultures led to the development of both live attenuated vaccines and inactivated vaccines for measles , polio , and other diseases .
around the turn of the century , the first sequencing of the human genome led to “ reverse vaccinology . ” This approach , whereby computational analysis of a pathogen ’ s genome enables identification and screening of a great many more potential vaccine targets than was previously possible , was used in the successful development of a vaccine against meningitis B .
the past decade has already yielded major advances in structure-assisted vaccine discovery , synthetic biology , systems biology , and immune monitoring . however , successfully translating these advances into the development of next-generation vaccines continues to be impeded by gaps in our understanding of the human immune response that protects against specific bacteria , viruses , or parasites .
that is why I , along with eight fellow scientists , have proposed the establishment of a new human-immunology-based clinical-research initiative , the Human Vaccines Project . in February 2014 , leading scientists and public-health specialists will gather in La Jolla , California , to craft a scientific plan to identify , prioritize , and , most important , solve the major problems currently hindering development of vaccines against diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis , and malaria .
such a project would represent a paradigm shift in vaccine development . the current process is long ( often spanning decades from concept to licensure ) , has a low probability of success ( because of the limitations of animal models in predicting immune response and efficacy in humans ) , and is costly ( often requiring hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a single vaccine ) .
consider this : in just the past few years , many candidate vaccines against HIV , dengue , herpes , tuberculosis , and staphylococcus aureus have failed , at a cost of more than $ 1 billion . investing that amount over the next decade in a coordinated effort to address the major questions facing vaccine development would rapidly accelerate our search for effective solutions , implying a transformative impact on individual and public health .
using recent advances , however , scientists have now identified highly conserved regions of this variable virus , determined their molecular structure , and begun designing next-generation vaccine candidates to elicit antibodies that target these regions to prevent HIV infection . but HIV vaccine development , like that for several other diseases , is still impeded by the limitations of what animal models can tell us about how to elicit the necessary immune responses in humans .
in systems biology , high-throughput technologies have increased the number of genetic and immunologic parameters assessed in trials . this approach has helped predict the efficacy of potential new-generation vaccines against yellow fever and influenza within days of immunization , compared with the usual timeframe of months or years .
vaccines already prevent the deaths of 2-3 million people every year , preempt human suffering , lighten the burden placed on health-care systems , and enable more rapid economic and social development . models show that adding even a partly effective AIDS vaccine to the current range of prevention and treatment procedures could dramatically lower the rate of HIV infection .
as the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu , one of the world ’ s great campaigners against HIV / AIDS , wrote recently : “ We must make the most of scientific advances over the last half-century , which have made vaccines for other preventable diseases the most powerful and cost-effective health-care investment that currently exists . ”
today , technological advances in vaccine discovery and immune monitoring allow us realistically to explore this potentially game-changing approach to disease prevention . February ’ s gathering in California may take us a giant step closer to a world without deadly and debilitating infectious diseases .
the G-20 to the Rescue ?
Brisbane – The G-20 ’ s upcoming meeting in Brisbane , Australia , comes at a time when a precarious global economy requires big decisions to be made . but it is far from clear who will provide the decisive voice needed to set a bold agenda – and then shepherd its implementation .
wealth and income have become increasingly concentrated , while middle-class incomes in the developed world have stagnated . tax avoidance by multinational companies is draining developing-country incomes , limiting their ability to invest in education and infrastructure .
many leading economists and policymakers are forecasting continued economic gloom . Stephen Roach has suggested that in the post-crisis global economy “ relapse is the rule ” ; economist Brad DeLong , speaking of the “ consequences of our lesser depression , ” argues that the pretense of a eurozone recovery has collapsed ; and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has acknowledged the need not only for structural reform , but also fiscal expansion to boost aggregate demand .
at the heart of their concerns is the lack of sustained demand needed to drive growth . while structural reforms – particularly on the supply side – are required in developed and developing countries , they are not sufficient to address what former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has called “ secular stagnation ” – that is , the difficulty of sustaining sufficient demand to permit normal levels of output .
the G-20 ’ s central task , therefore , must be to establish a framework for strong and sustainable growth . member states need to introduce reforms aimed at achieving a 2 % annual growth target , as agreed earlier this year by finance ministers .
unfortunately , no G-20 leader has seriously articulated this need , let alone lobbied for a solution . apart from a World Bank presentation for a possible pilot infrastructure program , there is little to suggest how the 2 % target could be met over the medium term .
G-20 governments , especially those with strong balance sheets , should be calling for large-scale public and private infrastructure investment to expand the productive capacity of member economies . in the area of tax avoidance , discussion needs to broaden beyond developed economies ; as the International Monetary Fund recently pointed out , developing economies ’ budgets are disproportionately affected by multinational companies ’ savvy accounting strategies .
unfortunately , judging by the initiatives already on the Brisbane agenda , the summit looks set to take a business-as-usual approach . if the G-20 fails to put policy meat on its rhetorical bones , it will risk looking weak and irrelevant .
one reason why some want a tighter group is that the G-20 struggles to achieve consensus . but this misses the &amp; nbsp ; point : it is harder to reach agreement precisely because all of the key leaders ( representing around two-thirds of the world ’ s population and 80 % of global GDP ) , whose support is needed for any truly global decision , are in the room .
the Brisbane Summit therefore needs to rediscover the activism that it displayed in 2008 and 2009 , during the height of the financial crisis . it must be led by the United States and other advanced economies , and backed up by major emerging economies .
Australia , as host , also has a role to play . the country is respected by developed and developing countries alike , often bridging the interests of both , and is widely viewed as an honest broker .
the modest initiatives on the table reflect the government ’ s anti-public-sector rhetoric . worse , as developed and developing countries are starting to take climate change seriously , Australia is moving in the opposite direction .
the Brisbane summit will be a crucial test for Australia , the G-20 , and the possibility of truly global policy coordination .
weak America = Weakened Europe
America ’ s power has been so overwhelming for so long that many think it has survived George W. Bush ’ s presidency unscathed . that this is untrue is demonstrated by those , from Russia ’ s Vladimir Putin and Venezuela ’ s Hugo Chávez to Iran ’ s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Zimbabwe ’ s Robert Mugabe , who are exploiting America ’ s loss of standing and influence .
President Putin tolerated a US presence in Central Asia to assist in the campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan and raised no serious objections when the US trashed the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty prohibiting strategic missile defenses . America , eager to bring both Ukraine and Georgia into NATO , felt scant need to consider Russian concerns , convinced that the Kremlin would have no choice but to bow to the inevitable .
in Ukraine , political forces resisting closer strategic links to the West have gained ground . and the Kremlin is aggressively portraying the planned establishment of a modest US missile defense installation in Poland and the Czech Republic as a threat to Russia ’ s vital security interests .
only a few years ago , Iran ’ s government seemed sufficiently in awe of the US to inch toward an agreement on its nuclear program that would have interrupted , and perhaps even halted , its enrichment activities . there was talk of possible bilateral contacts with the US , which , if successful , would have ended almost three decades of hostile relations .
these examples reflect the same message : America is losing clout around the world . the Bush administration is internationally exposed in both the arrogance of its concepts and the limits of its power .
never since the US became the world ’ s predominant power during World War II has there been a similar decline in its international influence . even during the Vietnam War and following its humiliating withdrawal from Southeast Asia , there was never any serious doubt about America ’ s authority and ability to deal with what was then the central strategic challenge , the Cold War .
in today ’ s interdependent world , however , it is no longer the number of nuclear warheads that bestows influence , but a country ’ s ability to get others to go along with policies that it regards as serving its major interests . Bush ’ s America has forfeited that influence – in the Middle East , in Asia and Africa , and in much of Europe .
many in the US like to think that this is a temporary state of affairs that will vanish with the election of a new president and Congress in 2008 . but they are neither sufficiently aware of the damage done nor realistic enough about the chances of Bush ’ s potential successors – many of whom initially supported his adventurism – to revive the trust and respect their country once enjoyed .
to achieve that will take more than a new face in the White House . it will require years of hard work to reconcile America ’ s resources and requirements , and to ensure that its initiatives can once again be seen as designed not to serve narrow US ideologies , but to advance a fair international order .
in the heyday of American dominance , European governments profited doubly : they were part of a powerful West and courted as a potential counterweight to US dominance by third countries . if they dissented from US positions , this did not seriously impair the West ’ s strategic efficacy because American power was more than sufficient to compensate .
at the same time , they will undermine their own international influence , allow others to play off Europe against America , destroying as well what chance remains for rebuilding the West with a reformed America . European leaders , even when they are unhappy over US positions , therefore need to combine forceful support for the transatlantic community of interests with discrete , if firm lobbying in Washington not to strain it to the breaking point .
fortunately , Angela Merkel , Nicolas Sarkozy , and Gordon Brown understand the challenge , and at least some parts of the Bush government seem aware of the problem . in the long period of American weakness , European leaders will have to demonstrate statesmanship for the West as a whole .
Europe ’ s German Ball and Chain
Brussels – A storm-tossed ship near dangerous cliffs needs a strong anchor to avoid finishing on the rocks . in 2012 , when a financial storm engulfed the eurozone , it was Germany that kept the European ship off the shoals of financial disaster .
she also backed the formation of a banking union , which remains incomplete but still represents a key step toward a financial system supervised by the European Central Bank . thanks to these measures , and ECB President Mario Draghi ’ s vow , which Germany tacitly approved , to do “ whatever it takes ” to save the euro , the financial storm abated .
but now the eurozone seems incapable of escaping near-deflation , with little economic growth and prices barely moving upwards .
when the crisis struck , the economies of the eurozone periphery were buffeted by the twin shocks of spiking risk premiums and a collapsing housing market . at the same time , the German economy benefited from the return of capital fleeing the periphery .
instead , the German economy has barely grown ; indeed , weaker world trade threatens to put it in recession . the current-account surplus , which was supposed to decline sharply , has actually increased , as savings have remained higher – and investment lower – than expected .
another problem , at least from the point of view of the rest of the eurozone , is that inflation in Germany remains too low . with German prices rising at less than 1 % annually , the eurozone periphery needs falling prices in order to regain the competitiveness lost during the pre-2008 boom years .
with no growth in Germany , the rest of the eurozone might not be able to reduce debt via external surpluses . and there might be no solution short of a magic button to increase German domestic demand .
but fiscal policy has been roughly neutral in recent years , and thus cannot be blamed for the German economy ’ s lack of dynamism . this year , the public-sector budget might move from a small deficit to what German officials call a “ black zero ” – a very small surplus .
the root cause of Germany ’ s sluggish economic performance in recent years is the continuing unwillingness of its households and enterprises to consume and invest . and it is difficult to see what the government can do about this .
indeed , investment has fallen despite financing conditions for enterprises that have never been easier , both in terms of ultra-low interest rates and banks ’ willingness to lend . yet Germany ’ s corporate sector remains reluctant to borrow and invest in the country , because it sees little reason to expect long-term economic growth , given that the population is set to decline and productivity gains remain anemic .
with investment unlikely to become a motor for the German economy , consumption holds the key to stronger demand growth in Germany . its weakness is somewhat surprising : real incomes are up , and the coalition government that came to power last year has introduced a series of generous welfare measures , including a large increase in the minimum wage , a reduction of the retirement age , and a special top-up pension for women with children .
but even these measures , which foreign observers have largely overlooked , have failed to boost consumer demand . so what more could the German government do to wean the Germans off their abstemious habits ?
but the growth fillip from public-sector infrastructure spending can only be modest . increasing infrastructure spending by a quarter , which would represent a huge administrative effort , would lift GDP growth by just 0.4 percentage points .
that , in turn , fuels the perception that responsibility lies with the German government , which is seen as unwilling to take the steps needed to strengthen domestic demand – even as it prohibits the periphery governments from spending more themselves . as unemployment remains stubbornly high and incomes stagnate in much of the eurozone , the temptation to blame “ the Germans ” is becoming ever stronger .
the German government , no surprise , does not even acknowledge that there is a problem . with unemployment remaining near record lows , the lack of demand growth is simply dismissed , and the absence of inflation is taken as a sign of success .
this is a mistake . Europe ’ s German anchor has become stuck , and the rising tide of anxiety among Germany ’ s partners should not leave its government indifferent .
weak Labor , Strong Securities Markets
what makes a company &apos;s owners willingly hand over control to professional managers ? that question is increasingly urgent as wealthy countries-as well as many transition and developing economies-attempt to create the robust securities markets needed to boost investment , productivity , and growth .
the formalistic civil-law systems that prevail in continental Europe supposedly provide inadequate protection , so ownership remains concentrated . by contrast , Anglo Saxon common-law systems empower judges to interpret open-ended fiduciary rules on a case-by-case basis , thereby establishing legal precedents that are binding on managers .
before World War I , Europe &apos;s civil-law countries were developing securities markets as fast as the US and the UK . indeed , regulatory agencies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) arose because common-law fiduciary duties failed to protect distant owners .
insider trading , for example , was generally legal under the rules governing fiduciary duties in America &apos;s states , which back then played a dominant role . by contrast , the SEC is a rule-generating institution of the type that civil-law countries like France or Germany would have little difficulty creating if they wished to .
they do not control the main costs that shareholders face when they do not manage the company themselves , such as unprofitable expansion , shirking , retention of free cash flow , and empire building . unless there is a conflict of interest between a company &apos;s management and its board , owners in common-law countries have no legal recourse when managers &apos; operational or strategic decisions are bad , stupid , or otherwise harmful to shareholders .
throughout the rich world , institutions that raise the costs to shareholders of turning over control to professional managers play a powerful role in determining outcomes . but these institutions reflect the political power of social forces , not the differences between civil-law and common-law systems .
in particular , ownership separation in the wealthy continental European nations and the US can be linked with the role of labor inside the firm and within society . in some nations , labor greatly influences the firm through politics-i.e. , opposing mass lay-offs and resisting restructuring plans that change the nature of the workplace .
faced with a no-fire rule , shareholders have reason to be very cautious : if expansion is not profitable , they cannot reduce labor costs . France , for example , is notorious for forcing foreign firms like Britain &apos;s Marks and Spencer to keep redundant workers on the payroll .
but in a labor-strong society , dominant shareholders-those with the most to lose if expansion goes awry-have reason to keep managers on a short leash . Italy &apos;s Fiat illustrates the problem : even a conservative government seeks to impede downsizing .
bargaining over the economic surplus is often open-ended , especially if competition is weak . where employees have high bargaining power , the profits pie is constantly up for re-division , both within the firm and at the national level .
if managers are only loosely tied to shareholders , they could more willingly give up a bigger share of the pie to labor . similarly , where shareholder interests do not come first , say , in a corporatist system , dominant owners have greater reason to keep financial information private , lest labor use it to press for more favorable terms .
managers in such &quot; left &quot; societies are no less technically capable , but their organizational constraints , incentives , and goals are less pro-shareholder . when forced to cut employment , they are more likely to think that they are destroying lives rather than raising economic efficiency and increasing wealth .
employees enjoy the least protection in the US , and a high degree of protection in Italy , France , and Germany . the correlation with ownership separation is striking : a sample of the 20 largest firms in each country shows that , whereas 90 % of the US companies have no shareholder with more than a 20 % stake , none of the Italian , French , or German firms have such highly dispersed ownership .
true , with only 16 countries rich enough to be included in the survey , the correlation isn &apos;t perfect . the United Kingdom is in seventh place in terms of labor-market flexibility , but a higher proportion of its largest companies have widely dispersed ownership than sixth-place Switzerland-and double the share of fifth-place Denmark and fourth-place Australia .
but whatever measures of &quot; political &quot; qualities and ownership separation we use , the index of employment protection appears to be the best predictor of ownership separation in the wealthy West . more fundamentally , creating the regulatory institutions conducive to ownership separation may be impossible unless a society &apos;s political orientation towards labor and capital is more favorable to capital .
the Failed State of Egypt ?
Cairo – The aggrieved supporters of ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi and the jubilant protesters who pushed the military to remove him have divided Egypt into two irreconcilable camps , both reflecting and reinforcing the country ’ s deeper problems . indeed , Egypt is now largely an ungovernable country that subsists on generous foreign handouts .
he was bent on purging the judiciary and the public prosecutor ’ s office , claiming that they were aligned with the protesters opposing his government and their military backers , who had been overthrown in 2011 . Morsi brooked little opposition in pushing through a controversial draft constitution .
just as damaging as Morsi ’ s governing style was the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s go-it-alone mentality . decades of persecution have instilled in its leaders the belief that the world is aligned against them .
the Brotherhood ’ s leaders believed that the United States and Egypt ’ s elite were bent on ensuring their failure . for this reason , they refused to reach out to their secular opponents to offer them a piece of the political pie .
the debate in the US , long Egypt ’ s primary ally and donor , did not center on strengthening Egypt ’ s embattled institutions , but focused instead on how to ease the military out of power by withholding aid . multilateral lenders like the International Monetary Fund were fixated on fiscal reforms such as reducing costly subsidies rather than shoring up a beleaguered economy .
today , a democratic transition that the West sought to portray as a model that other Arab nations could emulate lies in tatters . Egypt ’ s economy , bruised by the outflow of foreign investment and a dearth of tourists , is on life support .
their “ technical ” experts turned the country ’ s second city , Alexandria , into a Russian country club . after Egypt pivoted to the West in the wake of the 1973 war against Israel , America became its main patron .
but America ’ s ritual annual gift of roughly $ 1.5 billion could only dull the pain of Egypt ’ s problems , not resolve them . the country can no longer provide enough government stipends in the form of bureaucratic posts for college graduates .
by making aid conditional on economic reform and democratic transition , however , the international community risks political triage . it should instead focus on financial assistance that blunts Egyptians ’ frustrations and that contributes to building the institutions that will facilitate the transition toward democracy .
but , of the $ 1.56 billion that the US State Department requested for Egypt in 2013 , only $ 250 million is earmarked for non-military programs . the US should increase funding for projects that focus on governance , civil society , and strengthening the rule of law .
to bolster the economy , the US needs to shift its aid policies away from funding projects toward providing immediate budgetary relief . though financing water-efficiency schemes certainly helps society , its effects are felt years after the aid is initially dispensed .
the US , and other Western donors , should instead help Egypt to husband its resources , which are often misspent in an effort to placate its people . Egypt is the largest wheat importer in the world , and food subsidies account for approximately 2 % of GDP .
beyond such questions lies the fate of democracy in one of civilization ’ s most ancient lands . whoever triumphs in future elections will lack the legitimacy that only a majority can provide .
but , in a country that faces so many problems , the paradox of Morsi ’ s removal from power and the dilemmas of democracy that occasioned it are not among them .
preparing for the Unknown Unknowns
just as we seem to get our bearings , something happens to make us feel as if our legs have been knocked out from under us . actions and events often are intertwined , and what happens on one level – affecting individuals , states , economic sectors , and companies of all sizes – may have repercussions on others .
the recent terrorist attacks in Paris are a case in point , affecting not only the families and friends of the victims , or even only the people of France . the reverberations are being felt around the world , and they will continue to have an impact – far beyond Europe – on public policy , electoral politics , media freedom , and more .
the attacks came at a time when the world traditionally tries to make sense of the year ahead – to forecast the risks that lie in wait , the opportunities that will arise , and the challenges that will have to be overcome . but what about longer-term risks ?
for example , “ the biggest threat to the stability of the world in the next ten years comes from the risk of international conflict . ” And the menace of war is followed by a raft of social , environmental , geopolitical , technological , and economic risks and trends .
and yet we also know that the pace of change is faster than ever before , and that governments , businesses , and households are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up . beneath all of our identifying , quantifying , and mitigating of risk lies the undeniable and timeless truth that the only constant is change .
Machiavelli referred to it as fortuna : the events that shape us and determine our wellbeing are often beyond our reason and control . though we can attempt to plan for change , we cannot always predict the precise nature and time at which it will occur .
that is why , alongside all of the identifying , quantifying , and mitigating , we must also embrace the idea that not all change can be clearly foreseen and planned for . the implication is that we must instill in our families , organizations , and states the resilience and tools needed to act effectively in times of crisis – and thus to minimize the potentially damaging impact of unexpected change .
this ethos will also help us maximize the potential benefits of such flux . after all , without unforeseen change , much of human endeavor would be fruitless , and innovation would be unnecessary .
shocking things like the massacre at Charlie Hebdo in Paris happen , and they seem to be happening more frequently than ever . they turn our world upside down and make us question our sense of who we are .
more important is how much stronger , more capable , and more resilient we help our colleagues , partners , children , and fellow citizens become . perhaps the main risk this year – and in the decade ahead – is that we lose sight of this fundamental truth .
Weimar Russia Revisited
the phrase “ Weimar Russia ” first appeared about 13 years ago , at the height of the confrontation between then President Boris Yeltsin and the Supreme Soviet that ended when Yeltsin ’ s tanks shelled the parliament . the meaning was clear to all : Weimar Russia , like Weimar Germany , signified a weak republic attacked from within by nationalists yearning to restore authoritarian ways .
in the late 1990 ’ s and the early years of this decade , the problems that incited fears of a dysfunctional state seemed to fade . but over the past 18 months , the specter of Weimar has once again begun to haunt Russia .
if taken to extremes , Russian society ’ s response to its wrenching modernization could degenerate into a nationalist revolution led by xenophobes . a different and healthy conservative response is possible if the tattered remnants of old threads , torn apart in the course of postcommunist modernization , can reconnect and grow together in a new way .
the problem is that everyone writes history in their own manner , and that there are no scales that can fix the precise point at which the remedy of unifying patriotism turns into the lethal poison of rabid nationalism . Weimar Germany blindly poisoned itself .
in the period from 1991 to 1993 , nationalism was on the rise because Yeltsin ’ s infant democracy seemed weak , with the country in the throes of a deep economic crisis , as well as an acute confrontation between different branches of government . but what explains today ’ s resurgence of nationalism , when the regime and economy are strong , and all branches of government appear to operate in total unity ?
indeed , there are no practical reasons for Russia ’ s current system of governance to fall into crisis ( although such reasons may emerge in the event of an economic downturn ) . but there is another reason , no less important , that concerns morals and ideology .
challenges to established political authority have been chilled , fairly effectively , by means of state-sponsored patriotism . but the virus of nationalism has survived and multiplied .
moreover , nationalism has spread from the streets into the elite . nationalist statements that would have been confined to the extremist newspaper Den in the early 1990 ’ s are now considered normal , “ centrist , ” even commonplace .
today ’ s hardcore Russian nationalists consider Putin ’ s regime too soft , too pragmatic , too reasonable – in their language , “ weak and indecisive . ” They loathe it for its “ surrender ” in Ukraine to the “ Orange Revolution , ” and they condemn the decision to give land along Siberia ’ s Amur River to China .
the “ Putin Center ” can be displaced . recall that Russia ’ s pro-Western liberals , ascendant a decade ago , have been relegated to the ideological fringe , with the very word “ democrat ” ( let alone “ pro-West ” ) now a term of abuse .
fortunately , there is no sign yet ( not even on the horizon ) of a charismatic leader capable of forging the scattered energies of national-socialist grievances into a critical mass of hatred and “ national revival . ” Stalin ’ s ghost is no substitute for a real live leader ; he will never leap out of his portraits , no matter how often they are waved .
for example , no one even mentions the idea of introducing a dictatorship , abolishing elections , and so on . no matter how harshly Russia ’ s “ democrats ” are abused , the word “ democracy ” remains a sacred cow .
instead , a populist-nationalist revolution might resemble the attempt to overthrow Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991 , or a Russian version of Ukraine ’ s Orange Revolution . it might be some sort of “ democratic nationalist revolution ” – spontaneous , and not made by any one political party but by a popular mass movement .
it is likely that the regime will attempt to counter this eruption of nationalism while maintaining its strong statist rhetoric . but , in order to defeat the far right , Putin ’ s regime will be forced to take its stand on more or less liberal ideological grounds .
what liberals should do in these circumstances is obvious : support Putin ’ s regime insofar as it maintains the foundation and institutions of a liberal order . the populist nationalists , because they reject these fundamentals , are the unremitting political antagonists of all liberals .
yet an alliance with the nationalists against Putin currently tempts many Russian liberals . indeed , the most popular tactic among liberals nowadays is to unite with all opponents of the regime .
that scheme is both absurd and dangerous . after all , the word “ Weimar ” draws its infamy from the pact with the devil that German conservatives and royalists made by backing Hitler .
welcome to the Era of Incompetence
two diametrically opposed scenarios exist for what will happen to global real interest rates over the next generation .
according to this view , the principal problem faced by central banks will not be restraining demand as it shoots above potential , but boosting demand as it lags behind potential . they point to the fact that the world &apos;s major central banks - the Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank , and the Bank of Japan - have so firmly established their anti-inflation credibility that the inflation risk premium has been wrung out of interest rates .
believers in low interest rates also emphasize shifts in income distribution in the United States away from labor and toward capital , which have greatly boosted firms &apos; resources to finance investment internally and reduced their dependence on capital markets . they point to rapid technological progress , which has boosted output from new and old capital investments .
by contrast , those who predict generally high real interest rates over the next generation point to low savings rates in the US , high spending driven by demographic burdens in Europe , and feckless governments running chronic deficits and unsustainable fiscal policies . imagine a bunch of irresponsible Bush-like administrations making fiscal policy , forever .
sooner or later , the Chinese and Indian central banks &apos; desire to hold down exchange rates to boost exports and their rich citizens &apos; desire to keep their money in accounts at Bank of America will be offset by the sheer magnitude of investment opportunities . in this scenario , bond prices in post-industrial countries are heading for a serious fall - as are real estate prices in California , New York , and London .
what , then , is an economist to do ?
one could emulate J.P. Morgan , whose standard response to questions about stock prices , bond prices , and interest rates was to say simply , &quot; The market will fluctuate . &quot;
another alternative is to recall the late Rudi Dornbusch , who taught that any economist who forecasts interest rates based on fundamentals is a fool , because fundamentals are complex and unstable , shifting suddenly and substantially . even if an economist correctly understands fundamentals , Dornbusch warned , that doesn &apos;t mean that markets do .
so let me place my bet - which I think is only 60 % likely - and say that my best guess is that world real interest rates will be high over the next generation , and that current bond prices ( and real estate prices ) are not sustainable . four features of modern politics in the world &apos;s post-industrial core lead me to this conclusion :
· In the US , the collapse of &quot; grownup &quot; Republicans in Congress - the extraordinary failure of fiscal conservatives to mount any effective opposition to the Bush administration &apos;s renewed destabilization of American government finances . the deficit orgy of the Reagan era is looking less like a freak political accident and more like a structural feature of Republican Party governance - what the modern Republican governing coalition tends to do whenever it gains power ;
· The parallel collapse of a grownup Republican presence in the executive branch . as Ron Suskind reports in his recent biography of Bush &apos;s first Treasury Secretary , Paul O &apos;Neill , former Bush Budget Director Mitch Daniels once whispered to himself at the end of a disastrous meeting , &quot; Not a typical Republican package .
· The failure of Western European governments to even begin to think about how to address the coming fiscal crisis of the social-insurance state as a result of their aging populations ;
· The inability of Western European governments to enact sufficiently bold liberalizing reforms to create the possibility of full employment , together with the failure of western European monetary policy to be sufficiently stimulative to create the reality of full employment .
the arguments for low interest rates seem to me to require a degree of government competence that is unlikely , given political parties &apos; current positions and the existing structure of the institutions that make fiscal policy . I hope to be surprised .
power to the Poorest
BREMEN – An estimated 1.2 billion people worldwide , including 550 million in Africa and 400 million in India , have no access to electricity . most live in rural areas where the population is sparse and incomes are low , making it uneconomical to connect homes and businesses to a grid .
in fact , the consequences for people living without electricity can be dire : they may be deprived of adequate health care , or be unable to store fresh food . but one solution , based on the local use of renewable energy , requires minimal initial investment and can be expanded over time .
this “ boot-strap ” approach is based on the use of photovoltaics – a simple , universal , and scalable technology that is easy to maintain . typically , in the first stage of this process , consumers would use a renewable energy source such as LED lighting , selling any surplus until they save enough money to buy lamp oil ( on which Africans spend around $ 20 billion annually ) .
the additional revenue might initially come from selling small electricity surpluses to local farmers to recharge their mobile phones ( thereby allowing them to work out the optimal prices for their crops ) , or to help them irrigate farmland using small electric pumps .
but advances in the industry and over-production have reduced their price by as much as 75 % . the cheapest system , generating two watts of power , can cost as little as $ 10-20 and be expanded to almost any level , depending on the size and number of photovoltaic ( PV ) modules and the size of the battery storage unit .
a residential solar-power system consists of just three components : the PV modules , a battery storage unit , and a charge controller . such a system can supply low-voltage DC electric power at five volts for mobile phones , and 12V for LED lighting , pumps for outdoor use , and electrical appliances such as computers and televisions .
this makes sense only for systems that are larger than a kilowatt of peak power and that have sufficient battery capacity . local systems in one building could be connected to local low-voltage DC or 230V AC grids to improve the security of supply .
many residential systems break down after 3-5 years when the battery dies , undermining confidence in the system among owners who assumed that they had a lifetime supply of energy . but it is not a complicated process to demonstrate how to extend a battery ’ s life to as much as ten years .
in addition , our own research team is currently exploring ways to rejuvenate old solar or car batteries – without requiring any chemical treatment or disassembly – for re-use in a residential solar-power system .
we believe that existing distribution , sales , and maintenance networks for other goods and services could be adapted to supply and provide customer support for solar-power systems as well . for example , bicycle mechanics , who are plentiful in Africa and rural India , or small shop and kiosk owners could be trained to install and maintain these systems .
the combination of low-investment electricity generation for households and the ability to sell surpluses , scale up output , and access pre-existing distribution and maintenance networks bridges a crucial gap in the energy market .
what the West Owes Ukraine
Washington , DC – Ukraine may not be grabbing as many headlines now as it did a year ago , but the crisis there is far from over . the latest ceasefire agreement , concluded in Minsk in February , has contained , but not stopped , Russian military aggression .
instead , the old Soviet elites held onto power – and most of the country ’ s wealth – through corrupt practices that became entrenched in the country ’ s economy and political system . reforming both will be a major challenge – one that Ukraine ’ s leaders have lately committed themselves to meeting .
since February of last year , when the parliament voted then-President Viktor Yanukovych out of power by more than a two-thirds majority , Ukraine has held fresh elections for both institutions . hundreds of top officials have been replaced by young , Western-educated professionals , and the government is now working feverishly to implement deep and comprehensive reforms , including a new law on public procurement and a package of anti-corruption legislation .
on April 1 , household gas prices were quadrupled , taking them to half the market price , with offsetting compensation provided to the poor . and the parliament has enacted a law that harmonizes energy standards with those of the European Union , thereby delineating clearly the state ’ s role and opening the gas market to investors .
the good news is that the public largely understands and supports the government ’ s reform efforts . the bad news is that Ukraine still faces considerable destabilizing threats – beginning with a renewed Russian military offensive .
a Russian attack on , say , Mariupol , eastern Ukraine ’ s second-largest port ( accounting for roughly one-third of the country ’ s exports ) , would devastate an economy that is already tanking . though several factors – including Western sanctions , a lack of public support for war in Ukraine , and the Russian economy ’ s rapid decline – should discourage the Kremlin from taking such a step , they may not be enough .
nonetheless , the international financing that Ukraine has received , though invaluable , remains insufficient to support genuine recovery and reform . the latest bailout program foresees about $ 40 billion in funding , nearly half of which will come from the IMF , over the next four years .
indeed , given Ukraine ’ s large bond debts , many of which will mature in the next two years , there is a $ 15.3 billion funding gap in the bailout package , which the IMF and Ukraine ’ s government hope to plug with a debt restructuring . but , even if they succeed , Ukraine would need more funding than it is getting .
Europe ’ s leaders claim that they want to avoid giving Russia reason to escalate its war on Ukraine . but that is already happening , and Ukraine ’ s fight against Russia is , after all , a defense of core European values – and , indeed , of Europe itself .
Europe ’ s leaders argue that the central focus of their policy toward Ukraine must be to support its economic recovery . but here , too , Europe is doing too little , offering paltry credits of € 1.8 billion ( $ 1.9 billion ) this year , when € 10 billion would be more appropriate .
at a time when the country ’ s leaders and public are more committed than ever to combating corruption , building a welfare-creating economy , and becoming a normal liberal democracy , Europe should be eager to support it . it is time for Western politicians to remember their ideals – and stand up for them .
westernize the Black Sea Region
the bloody end to the schoolhouse hostage crisis in North Ossetia , and recent clashes in Georgia between government troops and separatist forces , have put the troubled Black Sea region on the front pages of newspapers once again . this rising violence is also a wake-up call for the West , highlighting the need for a new Euro-Atlantic strategy in a vitally important region that lies at the crossroads of Europe , Eurasia , and the Middle East .
with Afghanistan , Iraq , and Iran topping the list of strategic challenges facing the West , anchoring democracy and security in these new borderlands of the Euro-Atlantic community has become imperative for both the United States and the EU . moreover , success here can provide lessons in how to facilitate the daunting process of reform and modernization in the wider Middle East .
for the first time , a country in the region is matching its aspirations with the concrete steps needed to become a viable candidate for eventual membership in Euro-Atlantic institutions . a visitor to Georgia &apos;s capital , Tbilisi , now sees the same level of determination to join the West that existed a decade ago in the Baltic states .
America and Europe share an interest in the success of these efforts , particularly as they seek to diversify energy supplies away from Saudi Arabian and Persian Gulf oil . the Black Sea is poised to become a key conduit for non-OPEC , non-Gulf oil and natural gas flowing into European markets and beyond .
whether the end result is better relations or full integration of these countries into the EU and NATO is an open question . but both organizations need to reach out to these countries , a process that should be seen as the next phase in completing the wider Europe .
but the good news is that the EU and NATO are much better positioned to develop an ambitious strategy than they were vis-à-vis Central and Eastern Europe a decade ago . if the EU and NATO decide to launch a bold outreach strategy for the region , they will be able to draw on existing tools , conceptual talent , and practical experience .
as for the EU , the candidacies of Romania and Bulgaria need to be concluded successfully , together with the issue of Turkey &apos;s membership aspirations . an EU that includes Sofia and Bucharest , and that is on track with Ankara , will be well positioned to engage the wider region .
as opposed to a 100- or 200-meter sprint , both organizations need to think more in terms of a much longer race , perhaps a marathon . if countries in the region embrace the idea , a network of current EU and NATO members could step forward with projects and assistance aimed at promoting a Black Sea identity and community .
recent events in Georgia remind us that resolving the region &apos;s &quot; frozen conflicts &quot; - i.e. , those in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , of Transdneistria in Moldova , and Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan - must be a priority . in reality , these conflicts are not frozen ; they are festering wounds that breed corruption and organized crime .
so far , neither America nor Europe has made these conflicts a top priority . resolving these semi-dormant wars requires stepped-up political involvement , economic engagement , and a willingness to provide Western peacekeeping forces and monitors if and when they are needed .
but the long-term peace and stability needed to advance economic and political reform in the region will also require either a change in Russian behavior or a reduction in Russian influence . the experience of the last decade suggests that a policy of engaging the Kremlin intensely while protecting fundamental Western interests may be the best way to proceed .
developing a new Euro-Atlantic strategy for the Black Sea region must start with the democracies of North America and Europe recognizing their moral and political stake in the outcome . projecting stability and security in these countries is the next logical step in building a Europe &quot; whole and free &quot; and securing the Euro-Atlantic community &apos;s eastern frontier with the Middle East .
the Despotic Temptation
Madrid – US President Franklin D. Roosevelt , when asked about American support for the notorious Nicaraguan despot Anastasio Somoza , purportedly replied , “ He may be a son of a bitch , but he ’ s our son of a bitch . ” Whether or not the quip is apocryphal , it sums up a longstanding Western approach to much of the world – and one that underpinned US foreign policy throughout the Cold War .
but lately an even more troubling sentiment seems to have emerged , with Western leaders willing to settle not for “ our son of a bitch , ” but for just about any son of a bitch who can impose stability , whatever the cost . it is an alluring but dangerous mindset .
after all , as time passed , the ostensibly pragmatic clientelism of the Cold War proved far from ideal . indeed , in many cases – the Shah of Iran , Cambodia ’ s Lon Nol , Chile ’ s Augusto Pinochet , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ’ s Mobutu Sese Seko , to name a few – it led to long-term insecurity and disorder .
unable to contain the violence , suffering , and chaos engulfing the Middle East and North Africa – the consequences of which are increasingly being felt in Europe – Western leaders are falling back into the Cold War trap . all they want is for someone – and now virtually anyone – to enforce order .
this desperation is perhaps most apparent in Syria . after years of insisting that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was the problem , a growing number of Western policymakers and strategists are now suggesting that he may actually be part of the solution – or at least the transition .
likewise , both US Secretary of State John Kerry and British Prime Minister David Cameron now concede a role for Assad in a hypothetical transition . Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy went so far as to say that the world had to “ count on ” Assad in the fight against the Islamic State .
whether driven by realism or resignation , this shift reflects a distinct desire for stability – a desire that is reinforced , especially in Europe , by the presence of another governance black hole in Libya . the same desire has already driven the West to support Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ’ s regime in Egypt – despite its dubious origins and continuing repression – with only the slightest of pressure for reform .
when confronted with anarchy , this eagerness to secure stability by whatever means necessary is understandable . but it is a slippery slope .
as the Bulgarian political analyst Ivan Krastev recently noted , Putin – a long-time ally of Assad – is doing his best to promote the idea that Western efforts to promote good governance lead only to volatility . “ Rather than bringing about reforms , ” Putin declared in a recent address to the UN General Assembly , “ aggressive foreign interference has resulted in … violence , poverty , and social disaster . ”
however compelling this idea might be , and however weary the West feels , the reality , demonstrated starkly during the Cold War and its bloody aftermath , is that tyranny is never genuinely stable – certainly not in the long run . the desire for human dignity and respect – the cornerstones of good governance – cannot be quelled , especially at a time when people have unprecedented access to information through the Internet and mobile technologies .
so good governance is the key to long-term stability . but , like stability , good governance cannot be imposed from the outside ; rather , it must develop organically , supported by sturdy roots within a society .
this does not mean that there is nothing Western governments can do . on the contrary , by helping to cultivate a strong civil society at the local and national levels , external forces can play an important role in creating a strong foundation for good governance in crisis-stricken countries .
unfortunately , Western leaders have repeatedly shown that they lack the patience and dedication needed to engage consistently and humbly with communities in crisis-stricken countries or to provide the reliable , incremental , and prolonged governance assistance needed to prevent state collapse . with their short attention spans and heightened sense of their own importance , they prefer the option of simply installing a despot to deal with it .
the Politics of Islamophobia
when people panic , they can become hysterical , and hysteria often leads to mass violence . when politicians convince people that they are in a life-or-death battle – that survival is a matter of “ us or them ” – anything becomes possible .
Adolf Hitler combined all the elements of political catastrophe : hubris , charisma , greed , and the idea that “ Aryans ” and Jews were locked in a struggle for survival . of course , none of the demagogues in the West today – from Donald Trump in the United States to Marine Le Pen or Geert Wilders in Europe – are comparable to Hitler .
on the one hand , he promises to fix all the world ’ s problems , and to show China , Russia , the Islamic State , or anyone else who is boss . on the other hand , he claims that his vast and powerful country cannot take in desperate refugees from Syria , because , he warns , Muslim asylum-seekers might stage “ one of the great military coups of all time . ”
Trump ’ s Republican colleagues in the race for the US presidency , such as Ted Cruz , Ben Carson , and Marco Rubio , stoke similar fears about refugees . Cruz , as well as the supposedly more moderate Jeb Bush , even suggested that only Christians should be allowed into the US .
more than 10,000 people are killed every year by gun violence in the US – all but a handful for reasons having nothing to do with Islam . and yet all of the Republican candidates are proud of opposing gun-control measures ; indeed , they have no problem allowing people to enter a school or a bar bearing concealed weapons .
this is not to say that terrible acts of Islamist terror could not happen in the US , or elsewhere . they have , and there probably will be more of them , so long as the Middle East remains in turmoil and revolutionary Islam appeals to disaffected Western youth .
an American friend of mine speculated that , “ We might be one terrorist act away from a Trump presidency . ” A spectacular murder spree by Islamists could spook Americans enough to vote for the greatest fear-monger .
the greater danger is , however , that the demagogues will drive even mainstream politicians into their camp . since the November 13 terror attacks in Paris , François Hollande , the unpopular but altogether sensible French president , has been so afraid of being labeled a weakling by politicians of the right and far right that he has declared a national state of emergency – and war on the Islamic State ( ISIS ) .
as long as France ’ s state of emergency lasts , police may arrest people without warrants , break down the doors of private residences in the middle of the night , take over restaurants and other public places with armed force , and generally behave like agents in a police state . most French citizens are now so frightened of Islamist attacks that such measures are widely supported .
ISIS , despite its claims , is not a state , and Hollande should not treat it as one . besides , even if bombing ISIS strongholds in Iraq or Syria makes military sense , it won ’ t break the spell of Islamist revolution for frustrated , bored , and marginalized young people in French slums .
most Muslims are not violent revolutionaries who condone , let alone admire , mass violence . ISIS seeks to broaden its support , especially among young Muslims , by convincing them that true Muslims are in an existential war with the West – that the infidels are their mortal enemies .
so the more a Western government allows its policemen to humiliate and bully Muslims in the name of security , the more ISIS is likely to win European recruits . the only way to combat revolutionary Islamist violence is to gain the trust of law-abiding Muslims in the West .
likewise , when it comes to civil wars in the Middle East , Western restraint is usually a better strategy than hasty military intervention driven by domestic fear . Republican candidates in the US are already using the recent murder spree in Paris to blame President Barack Obama , and by extension any future Democratic candidate , for being weak .
this bellicosity has had the effect of pushing Hillary Clinton , the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination , into distancing herself from Obama . like Hollande , she has to assuage public fear by talking tough and promising more military action .
his policies have sometimes been inconsistent and irresolute . but in his refusal to give in to panic and act rashly , he has been far braver than all the big talkers who accuse him of being a wimp .
what About the World ?
as America ’ s primaries move beyond Iowa and New Hampshire , it is simply impossible to predict who will be the Democratic and Republican nominees , much less who will become the 44th president of the United States . but it is not too soon to address the question of what effect US foreign policy is having on the campaign and what it reveals about how Americans see the world .
this is unexpected , because only six months ago the war in Iraq dominated the political landscape . although Iraq still matters a lot to Americans , its importance for determining how they vote has receded , partly because US casualties there are markedly down as the security situation appears to be gradually improving .
a third reason for the modest impact of international issues on voters ’ choice of the next president is another surprising development : more agreement between and among the leading candidates than meets the eye . there is something of a consensus , for example , emerging around the notion that the US should remain in Iraq for some time to come , albeit with a reduced level of military forces .
there is also widespread acknowledgement that the US must do more both at home and diplomatically to address global climate change ; that the US must work with its European allies to prevent Afghanistan from slipping back into anarchy ; and that the US must take the strongest possible stand against terrorism and those who would support it in any way . no major candidate is advocating anything remotely resembling isolationism .
finally , and perhaps most importantly , the deterioration of America ’ s economy is now overshadowing foreign policy . the greatest crisis facing many Americans is their increasing inability to meet their monthly mortgage payments .
along with the economy , a dominant issue on the political agenda – and one that has affected Republican politics in particular – is immigration . there is growing opposition to illegal entry , but no consensus about what to do about those who have been in the country illegally for years or those who want to come to the US in the future .
it is also possible to see in the politics of both parties mounting concern about globalization . with tougher economic times inevitably come tougher positions toward foreign competition and outsourcing .
there may also be latent concern about foreign policy in the attention being given to the quantity and quality of candidates ’ relevant experience . a desire for “ change ” is a common refrain of the American debate , but it is far from the only one .
we saw this a few weeks ago , when former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated . democratic and Republican candidates alike were called upon to explain what they would be prepared to do if there were an opportunity to capture Osama Bin Laden or a need to secure Pakistan ’ s nuclear weapons .
America ’ s next president will face a host of pressing and difficult foreign policy challenges – and how he or she responds will affect not only the US , but the entire world . in the meantime , though , foreign policy will have only an indirect influence on Americans ’ choice .
what Are Homebuyers Thinking ?
as I argued last year , in the second edition of my book Irrational Exuberance , the boom is rooted in speculative investment by ordinary homebuyers , fueled substantially by the worldwide perception that capitalism has triumphed , and that all people must look out for themselves by acquiring property . convinced that private ownership has become essential to smart living , buyers bid up home prices .
moreover , the fear that one must get in on the boom before it is too late often drives people to bid up home prices faster now . this certainly seems to be the market psychology in China and India , where rapidly rising incomes and newly successful people are widely expected to put pressure on markets for land , real estate , and construction materials .
but the boom generated by such beliefs cannot go on forever , because prices can ’ t go up forever , and there are already signs of a hard landing . in the United States , newspapers and magazines are trumpeting reports in the last few months that the decade-long boom in home prices may be at an end , and that the bubble may be bursting .
the new futures market for single-family homes at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( which I helped establish last May with our firm MacroMarkets LLC ) is predicting that by next August prices will fall between 6 % and 8 % in all ten US cities traded .
if home prices crash in the US , the bastion of capitalism , could it destroy confidence and end the boom in other countries ? if so , could a worldwide recession follow ?
this scenario is a distinct possibility , although there are reasons to be skeptical . most importantly , the ultimate sources of the housing boom – the beliefs about capitalism and future economic growth – seem solidly entrenched .
the downward price trend in the US market , for example , does not seem to reflect underlying changes in long-run economic confidence . the survey that Karl Case and I conducted in May and June of this year , under the auspices of the Yale School of Management , shows sharp declines in short-term expectations for home prices in the US , but relatively little change in long-term expectations .
maybe real estate prices are unlikely to fall to pre-boom levels because the fundamental change in perceptions concerning capitalism ’ s triumph will be longstanding . changes in people ’ s fundamental ways of thinking are not easily reversed .
a search of old newspapers finds surprisingly few articles about the outlook for home prices . those that did appear generally seem to be based on the assumption that minor fluctuations in construction costs , not massive market swings , drove the modest home price movements that they noted .
indeed , hardly anything interesting about home prices was ever reported at all , aside from an occasional comment in an article about something else . for example , an article in The Times of London in 1970 argued that rising home prices reflected the switch to a new British Standard Time ( imposed as a three-year experiment in 1968 to facilitate commerce with Western Europe by putting Britain in the same time zone ) .
to understand the nature of the subsequent shift , consider that it is hard to find anyone today who worries that automobile prices will soar because rising demand in China and India for steel and other materials will push automobile prices out of reach in the future . though a small group of collectors invests speculatively in antique or specialty cars , the idea of speculating in automobiles just is not in the public consciousness .
high and rapidly rising home prices tend to stimulate new housing supply , which in turn tends to undermine prices . over a period of years , as people see how much new supply there is , they may begin to revise their view that homes are such a terrific investment , causing a gradual , but eventually significant , drop in home prices .
indeed , while changes in fundamental perceptions may not occur easily or fast , they should never be ruled out . urban land prices in major Japanese cities have steadily dropped over much of the period since 1991 , as the enormous faith in the miraculous powers of Japanese capitalism gradually faded .
the same kind of erosion in home prices could occur in many cities around the world . all that is required is that growth in housing supply eventually outstrips investors ’ faith in capitalism to sustain faster growth in demand .
what Can Save the Euro ?
even some of the ostensibly “ responsible ” members of the eurozone are facing higher interest rates . economists on both sides of the Atlantic are now discussing not just whether the euro will survive , but how to ensure that its demise causes the least turmoil possible .
it is increasingly evident that Europe ’ s political leaders , for all their commitment to the euro ’ s survival , do not have a good grasp of what is required to make the single currency work . the prevailing view when the euro was established was that all that was required was fiscal discipline – no country ’ s fiscal deficit or public debt , relative to GDP , should be too large .
so , how will the European Union distinguish between “ good ” current-account deficits – a government creates a favorable business climate , generating inflows of foreign direct investment – &amp; # 160 ; and “ bad ” current-account deficits ? preventing bad current-account deficits would require far greater intervention in the private sector than the neoliberal and single-market doctrines that were fashionable at the euro ’ s founding would imply .
should such irrational exuberance force the government , willy-nilly , to curtail public investment ? does this mean that government must decide which capital flows – say into real-estate investment , for example – are bad , and so must be taxed or otherwise curbed ?
after each crisis , an explanation emerges , which the next crisis shows to be wrong , or at least inadequate . the 1980 ’ s Latin American crisis was caused by excessive borrowing ; but that could not explain Mexico ’ s 1994 crisis , so it was attributed to under-saving .
then came East Asia , which had high savings rates , so the new explanation was “ governance . ” &amp; # 160 ; But this , too , made little sense , given that the Scandinavian countries – which have the most transparent governance in the world – had suffered a crisis a few years earlier .
there is , interestingly , a common thread running through all of these cases , as well as the 2008 crisis : financial sectors behaved badly and failed to assess creditworthiness and manage risk as they were supposed to do .
moreover , free labor mobility means that individuals can choose whether to pay their parents ’ debts : young Irish can simply escape repaying the foolish bank-bailout obligations assumed by their government by leaving the country . of course , migration is supposed to be good , as it reallocates labor to where its return is highest .
migration is , of course , part of the adjustment mechanism that makes America work as a single market with a single currency . even more important is the federal government ’ s role in helping states that face , say , high unemployment , by allocating additional tax revenue to them – the so-called “ transfer union ” so loathed by many Germans .
but are European countries with lagging productivity willing to accept depopulation ? Alternatively , are they willing to face the pain of “ internal ” devaluation , a process that failed under the gold standard and is failing under the euro ?
even if those from Europe ’ s northern countries are right in claiming that the euro would work if effective discipline could be imposed on others ( I think they are wrong ) , they are deluding themselves with a morality play . it is fine to blame their southern compatriots for fiscal profligacy , or , in the case of Spain and Ireland , for letting free markets have free reign , without seeing where that would lead .
they know that growth is needed . but , rather than deal with today ’ s problems and find a formula for growth , they prefer to deliver homilies about what some previous government should have done.This may be satisfying for the sermonizer , but it won ’ t solve Europe ’ s problems – and it won ’ t save the euro . &amp; # 160 ;
what China Wants in 2012
indeed , when China ’ s Premier Wen Jiabao visited Prague in May 2009 for the 11th China-European Union summit , he explained that China is opposed to the G-2 concept . it is China ’ s firm intention never to seek hegemony , nor to support global domination by a small minority of countries .
consider Europe – a splendid and time-honored civilization , and now a major player on the world stage . the progressive deepening of EU integration has brought dynamic vigor to the European continent ; despite Europe ’ s current difficulties , it still boasts extraordinary overall strength and international influence .
in the wake of the global financial crisis and the eurozone ’ s sovereign-debt crisis , China has bought government bonds , made direct investments , and sent business delegations to Europe . during Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Zapatero ’ s visit to Beijing in April 2011 , Wen reaffirmed China ’ s willingness to continue purchasing Spanish government bonds as a further demonstration of our support for Europe ’ s efforts to emerge from its crisis .
China-EU cooperation will be essential to maintaining global peace and stability . we share a commitment to resolving international issues through political means , and both sides have already played a constructive role in addressing global challenges such as climate change , terrorism , and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
the parallel launch of China ’ s 12th Five-Year Plan and Europe ’ s 2020 Strategy has also helped to deepen our cooperation . China and Europe worked together after 2008 to prevent a global financial meltdown , oppose protectionism , and promote reform of the international financial system , thus facilitating worldwide economic recovery .
that relationship has gone through some rough patches since diplomatic ties were established in 1979 , but , overall , it has continued to grow and benefit both sides . today , China and the US share more interests than ever , and there are encouraging prospects for still broader cooperation .
when President Hu Jintao visited Washington , DC in January 2011 , he and President Barack Obama agreed to build what Hu referred to as “ a China-US cooperative partnership based on respect and mutual benefit . ”
as the three major global powers , China , the EU , and the US must strengthen their cooperation , and must work with the rest of the world to face the complex international issues that challenge us all . together , we must shoulder the great task of upholding world peace and promoting common development .
Hu once said that the twenty-first century should be a century of peace , development , and cooperation . China is willing to join with the EU , the US , and the rest of the world to realize the potential of a truly harmonious world .
over the Cliff We Go
Berkeley – Unless something unexpected happens , the United States ’ many legislated reductions in taxes over the past 12 years – all of which have been explicitly temporary – will expire simultaneously at the start of 2013 . American tax rates will revert overnight to their Clinton-era levels .
some of these reductions were implemented to fight what was seen four years ago as a temporary downturn . although their supporters wanted to make them permanent , claiming that they were temporary allowed for the circumvention of procedural requirements in the legislative process that Democrats had created in a vain effort to guarantee fiscal sanity .
the immediate increase in tax rates is only part of the story . at the same time , automatic reductions in the defense budget and “ discretionary ” domestic spending – agreed to by both Democrats and Republicans in the summer of 2011 – &amp; # 160 ; will take effect .
yes , there will be big spending cuts – which will hit defense contractors , doctors with Medicare patients , and all who benefit from or rely on government discretionary spending – and substantial tax increases . but , to balance the budget in the long run , either taxes have to go up or spending has to go down relative to some baseline , or both .
but , they fear that calling for spending cuts will be unpopular , unlike , they hope , demands to balance the budget . for them , the problem with the fiscal cliff is that it does not cut spending enough and raises taxes too much .
second , and more important for those who worry about the US economy ’ s health , the process is not well-described by the term “ fiscal cliff . ” It is , rather , an austerity bomb that hits an economy in which unemployment remains high , the employment-to-population ratio remains horrifyingly low , and there are only feeble signs that the large gap between current and potential output is closing .
spending cuts and tax increases that in the long run restore fiscal sanity and balance are good . having them all hit a weak , still-depressed economy simultaneously is not good .
first , Republicans and Democrats must negotiate a bipartisan agreement to stretch out the spending cuts and tax increases that take effect on January 1 , 2013 . that way , they will affect the economy gradually over five years , rather than all at once .
consumers will be spending less in 2013 , owing to higher taxes , as will government , which means that someone has to be spending more . housing construction and exports are the obvious candidates , and both can be boosted somewhat by more aggressive balance-sheet operations by the Fed , together with promises of continued low nominal interest rates and higher inflation in the medium term .
third , the large government-sponsored mortgage enterprises , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , should be used as macroeconomic-policy tools to restore housing construction to its long-term trend level . this should have been done five years ago , but better late than never .
finally , and also five years too late , the US Treasury secretary should announce that while the strong-dollar doctrine was appropriate ( and in America ’ s interest ) during the dot-com boom , the country needs a weak dollar in the aftermath of the austerity bomb ’ s detonation .
reaching the wrong agreement to defuse the austerity bomb , or cushion the economy from its impact , would merely recreate America ’ s long-run structural budget deficit – &amp; # 160 ; a very bad outcome . failure to take all four steps outlined above all but guarantees renewed recession in America , even if a good agreement is reached on stretching out the tax hikes and spending cuts .
what Communism Still Teaches Us
Prague - The fifteenth anniversary of the Velvet Revolution on November 17 , 1989 , which brought an end to 41 years of communist dictatorship in Czechoslovakia , is an opportunity to ponder the meaning of moral behavior and free action . today we live in a democratic society , but many people - not only in the Czech Republic - still believe that they are not true masters of their destiny .
during the communist era , most people believed that individual efforts to effect change did not make sense . Communist leaders insisted that the system was the result of history &apos;s objective laws , which could not be challenged , and those who refused this logic were punished - just in case .
unfortunately , the way of thinking that supported Communist dictatorships has not disappeared entirely . some politicians and pundits maintain that Communism merely collapsed under its own weight - again , owing to &quot; objective laws &quot; of history .
the very same people often believe in other manifestations of inevitability , such as various supposed laws of the market and other &quot; invisible hands &quot; that direct our lives . as there is not much space in such thinking for individual moral action , social critics are often ridiculed as naive moralists or elitists .
democracy is increasingly seen as a mere ritual . in general , Western societies , it seems , are experiencing a certain crisis of the democratic ethos and active citizenship .
but perhaps the problem is deeper : global corporations , media cartels , and powerful bureaucracies are transforming political parties into organizations whose main task is no longer public service , but the protection of specific clienteles and interests . politics is becoming a battleground for lobbyists ; media trivialize serious problems ; democracy often looks like a virtual game for consumers , rather than a serious business for serious citizens .
however , we were not mistaken when we argued that Communism was not a mere dead end of Western rationalism . bureaucratization , anonymous manipulation , and emphasis on mass conformism were brought to &quot; perfection &quot; in the Communist system ; however , some of the very same threats are with us today .
we were already certain then that if democracy is emptied of values and reduced to a competition of political parties that have &quot; guaranteed &quot; solutions to everything , it can be quite undemocratic . this is why we put so much emphasis on the moral dimension of politics and a vibrant civil society as counterweights to political parties and state institutions .
the end of the bipolar world represented a great opportunity to make the international order more humane . instead , we witness a process of economic globalization that has escaped political control and , as such , is causing economic havoc as well as ecological devastation in many parts of the world .
the fall of Communism was an opportunity to create more effective global political institutions based on democratic principles - institutions that could stop what appears to be , in its current form , the self-destructive tendency of our industrial world . if we do not want to be overrun by anonymous forces , the principles of freedom , equality and solidarity - the foundation of stability and prosperity in Western democracies - must start working globally .
but , above all , it is necessary - just as it was during the Communist era - that we not lose faith in the meaning of alternative centers of thought and civic action . let &apos;s not allow ourselves to be manipulated into believing that attempts to change the &quot; established &quot; order and &quot; objective &quot; laws do not make sense .
we could start , for example , with the United Nations , which , in its current form , is a relic of the situation shortly after the end of World War II . it does not reflect the influence of some new regional powers , while immorally equating countries whose representatives are democratically elected and those whose representatives speak only for themselves or their juntas , at best .
all of its miracles , as well as its terrifying contradictions , can be explained as consequences of an ethos that is initially European . therefore , unifying Europe should set an example for the rest of the world regarding how to face the various dangers and horrors that are engulfing us today .
indeed , such a task - which is closely tied to the success of European integration - would be an authentic fulfillment of the European sense of global responsibility . and it would be a much better strategy than cheaply blaming America for the contemporary world &apos;s various problems .
what Corporate Tax for Europe ?
the European Commission is considering a common model of corporate taxation for the European Union that cannot possibly work . instead , it should consider a simpler , and more viable , alternative that already exists .
corporate income in the EU is currently taxed under widely divergent national rules , based on separate accounting ( SA ) of income earned in each country . cross-border intra-company transactions are accounted for according to market prices for similar transactions – the so-called “ arm ’ s-length principle ” ( ALP ) .
the system is complex , expensive to administer , and can result in double taxation because members usually do not allow full write-offs for losses and tax liabilities incurred abroad . it is also prone to tax evasion , owing to different definitions of corporate income in the member states and the vast opportunities for cheating offered by ALP ( since reference market prices often do not exist ) , not to mention profit-shifting to low-tax jurisdictions .
earned income would be calculated on a consolidated basis for the group and then “ apportioned ” among the member states according to a formula reflecting each business unit ’ s contribution to overall group income . the formula could include such factors as sales , payroll , and tangible assets , as in Canada and the United States , or value-added , adjusted to exclude imports in order to measure the value-added “ produced ” in each country .
under this approach , taxable income would be determined from the consolidated accounts based on international accounting standards ( IAS ) , which since 2005 have become legally binding for EU-listed companies ’ financial reports . this offers full tax write-offs for losses within company groups , and transfer prices would no longer matter .
even so , the Commission ’ s proposal has fatal shortcomings . for one thing , the factors included in the apportionment formula would in practice be taxed at the national rates , creating fresh incentives for factor- and profit-shifting .
the accrual principle typical of financial accounting is incompatible with tax systems ’ realization principle . moreover , the IAS leaves the allocation of profit and losses to different fiscal years largely undetermined , with each member state choosing different solutions .
the attribution of companies to a common group would need to be based on legal control , that is , ownership of some defined threshold of equity – 51 % or higher . but a much lower share of equity often is sufficient to secure de facto control , thus encouraging groups to adapt their capital structure – moving firms in and out of the group ’ s boundaries – to minimize tax liabilities .
the idea of a common tax base must be preserved in order to simplify the system and narrow the scope for profit-shifting . however , a radical change in approach is required : the notion of income as a basis for corporate taxation should be scrapped altogether .
referring to corporate income made sense when company taxation was seen as a “ back stop ” within a system of progressive taxation of personal incomes . but most countries have now adopted “ dual ” income taxation that treat the fruits of capital more leniently than other personal income .
this disincentive disappears if the corporate tax base is decoupled from current profits and linked to some broad measure of activity . indeed , this would create an incentive for each company to outperform the average , since above-average profits would go untaxed .
while taxing the return on capital at the national level could discourage investment , taxing companies in exchange for location advantages might not . countries that offer world-class infrastructure , high-skill staff , and simple business rules may be well entitled to ask companies to pay a commensurate tax in return .
in sum , the EU “ federal ” corporate tax should be thought of as a benefit tax , based on a broad measure of activity , applied at a moderate rate , and unrelated to current returns ; nor should it be deductible from other taxes . among the various options under consideration , the value-added tax base – perhaps averaged over a number of years – looks best , since the accounting and tax-assessment infrastructures already exist .
of course , value-added includes profits , and to this extent the incentive for companies to manipulate transfer prices may reappear . but the incentive would be much weakened , because gross returns typically represent a fairly small share of total value-added .
this model leaves the assessment and administration of corporate taxes entirely in the hands of member states , and would not require harmonization of legal and accounting rules . it would be transparent , simple , and easy to administer .
indeed , the only losers would be Europe ’ s outsized army of tax lawyers and accountants .
what do Arabs Want ?
Cairo – The self-immolation a year ago of Tunisian street vendor Mohammed Bouazizi triggered a wave of popular protests that spread across the Arab world , forcing out dictators in Egypt , Libya , and Yemen . now , Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , too , seems near the end of his rule .
but what values are driving these movements , and what kind of change do their adherents want ? a series of surveys in the Arab world last summer highlights some significant shifts in public opinion .
in surveys , 84 % of Egyptians and 66 % of Lebanese regarded democracy and economic prosperity as the Arab Spring ’ s goal . in both countries , only about 9 % believed that these movements aimed to establish an Islamic government .
for Egypt , Iraq , and Saudi Arabia , where trend data are available , the Arab Spring reflected a significant shift in people ’ s values concerning national identity . in 2001 , only 8 % of Egyptians defined themselves as Egyptians above all , while 81 % defined themselves as Muslims .
in the wake of the Arab Spring , however , these numbers changed dramatically : those defining themselves as Egyptians rose to 50 % , 2 % more than those who defined themselves as Muslims . &amp; # 160 ; Among Iraqis , primary self-identification in national terms jumped from 23 % of respondents in 2004 to 57 % in 2011 .
among Iraqis , the percentage of those who agreed that Iraq would be a better place if religion and politics were separated increased from 50 % in 2004 to almost 70 % in 2011 . similar data are not available for Egypt and Saudi Arabia , but both countries show a decline in support for sharia .
they did not mind having Americans , British , or French as neighbors . religiosity did not predict participation , while religious intolerance reduced participation .
how , then , to explain the inconsistency between the survey data and Egypt ’ s election results ? first , the fundamentalists benefited from years of political organizing and activism , and thus were better able to mobilize their supporters , whereas the liberals , who led the uprising against the former regime , lacked nationwide organization and had little time to translate their newly acquired political capital into votes .
second , the liberals ’ priorities were misplaced . instead of pushing their agenda forward among Egyptians , they focused on the wrong enemy , spending invaluable time organizing rallies against the army .
liberalism has been under continuous attack for decades from religious extremists and religious institutions , and liberal organizations were stifled by oppressive rules . if the Mubarak regime had fallen under the banner of political Islam , Muslim fundamentalists would have been in a much better position to advance more exclusivist claims over the revolution and the country .
as a result , support for sharia declined and national identity soared . insofar as political discourse is focused on national rebuilding and freedom , Islamic fundamentalists , in Egypt and elsewhere , will face an uphill battle .
what do Egypt ’ s Generals Want ?
Cairo – “ Whatever the majority in the People ’ s Assembly , they are very welcome , because they won ’ t have the ability to impose anything that the people don ’ t want . ” Thus declared General Mukhtar al-Mulla , a member of Egypt ’ s ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces ( SCAF ) .
al-Mulla ’ s message was that the Islamists ’ victory in Egypt ’ s recent election gives them neither executive power nor control of the framing of a new constitution . but General Sami Anan , Chief of Staff and the SCAF ’ s deputy head , quickly countered that al-Mulla ’ s statement does not necessarily represent the official views of the Council .
so , one year after the revolution that overthrew Hosni Mubarak , who , exactly , will set Egypt ’ s political direction ?
the electoral victory of the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s political wing and the Salafi parties , which together won more than 70 % of the parliamentary seats , will give them strong influence over the transitional period and in drafting the constitution . but they are not alone .
indeed , while the army , the most powerful of the three actors , still officially controls the country , there is little confidence in the generals ’ commitment to democracy . “ The SCAF are either anti-democratic … .or some of their advisers told them that democracy is not in their best interest , ” says Hazem Abd al-Azim , a nominee in the first post-Mubarak government .
ideally , they would like to combine the Algerian army ’ s current power and the Turkish army ’ s legitimacy . this implies a parliament with limited powers , a weak presidency subordinate to the army , and constitutional prerogatives that legitimate the army ’ s intervention in politics .
the minimum that they insist on is reflected in statements by Generals al-Mulla , Mamdouh Shahim , Ismail Etman , and others . that would mean a veto in high politics , independence for the army ’ s budget and vast economic empire , legal immunity from prosecution on charges stemming from corruption or repression , and constitutional prerogatives to guarantee these arrangements .
the new parliament and constitutional assembly will have to lead the negotiations with the SCAF . but , given that any successful democratic transition must include meaningful civilian control over the armed forces and the security apparatus , the SCAF ’ s minimum demands could render the process meaningless .
the veto in high politics would include any issues that touch on national security or sensitive foreign policy , most importantly the relationship with Israel . with an Islamist majority in the parliament promising to “ revise ” the peace agreement with Israel , tensions over foreign policy are likely to rise .
the independent military-commercial empire , which benefits from preferential customs and exchange rates , no taxation , land-confiscation rights , and an army of almost-free laborers ( conscripted soldiers ) , is another thorny issue . with the Egyptian economy suffering , elected politicians might seek to improve conditions by moving against the military ’ s civilian assets – namely , by revising the preferential rates and imposing a form of taxation .
“ The Field-Marshal should be in jail now , ” screamed the elected leftist MP , Abu Ezz al-Hariri , on the second day of the new parliamentary session . when Mahmoud Ghozlan , the Muslim Brotherhood spokesperson , proposed immunity ( known in Egypt as the “ safe-exit ” option ) , he faced a wave of harsh criticism .
pressure from the United States has also influenced the SCAF ’ s decision-making . “ The military establishment receives $ 1.3 billion from the US … .They are very sensitive to US requests , ” according to Saad Eddin Ibrahim , who lobbied the Obama administration to support the revolution in January 2011 .
but most of the SCAF ’ s pro-democracy decisions have come as a result of massive pressure from Tahrir Square . this includes the removal of Mubarak , his trial ( and that of other regime figures ) , and bringing forward the presidential election from 2013 to June 2012 .
two other factors are equally , if not more , influential : the status quo inherited from the Mubarak era and the army ’ s internal cohesion . with few exceptions , the SCAF ’ s members benefited significantly from Mubarak ’ s regime .
“ The sight of officers in uniform protesting in Tahrir Square and speaking on Al Jazeera really worries the Field Marshal , ” a former officer told me . and one way to maintain internal cohesion is to create “ demons ” – a lesson learned from the “ dirty wars ” in Algeria in the 1990 ’ s and Argentina in the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s .
last October , amid an unnecessary escalation of sectarian violence , state-owned television featured a hospitalized Egyptian soldier screaming , “ The Copts killed my colleague ! ” The systematic demonization of the Tahririst groups , and the violent escalation that followed in November and December , served the same purpose .
a year ago , Saad al-Ketatni , the Muslim Brotherhood leader , would never have dreamed of being Speaker of Parliament . the same applies to the leftists and liberals who now hold around 20 % of the parliament ’ s seats .
Egypt may become stuck in democratization ’ s slow lane , but there will be no U-turn . the hundreds of thousands who marched to Tahrir Square on the revolution ’ s anniversary will guarantee that .
what Do Muslim Women Want ?
new YORK – When caricature takes the place of dialogue , everyone suffers – especially when it comes to understanding issues affecting women , who struggle worldwide against being silenced . some right-wing American bloggers recently twisted an article that I wrote in a way that did just that .
I wrote that many women activists in Muslim countries tend to emphasize issues such as honor killings , legal inequality , and lack of access to education , and that they express frustration that the obsession among Westerners with Muslim women ’ s clothing can come at the expense of these concerns . I also pointed out that many Muslim feminists defend their dress in terms of nationalism , anti-imperialism , or as a matter of faith .
this provoked a small firestorm of distortion in the West : “ Wolf Wants to Institutionalize the Burka , ” etc . it was depressing to see a simple appeal for Westerners to listen to Muslim women deliberately distorted into a representation of all Muslim women as meek , will-less beings in need of rescue .
the women leaders I met in Amman were not saying , “ Please tell the West to save us . ” They were too busy making egalitarian , modernist new worlds of their own , with an Arab , and often Islamic , imprimatur .
though she can no longer practice journalism directly , Princess Rym is also co-founding new Jordanian journalism school . her aim is to replace journalists ’ acceptance of the “ party line ” – even if the party is her own extended family – with a more critical perspective .
but it would be a mistake to underestimate her seriousness . I call her “ Martha Stewart meets Che Guevara , ” because , when not renovating the elegant public spaces of her hotel , she is suing Israeli generals for war crimes that she claims were committed against civilians in Gaza .
finally there is Rana Husseini herself – a role model for investigative reporters everywhere who began documenting and investigating honor killings in her newspaper , The Jordan Times . honor killings claim an estimated 5,000 women every year , and are increasingly common in immigrant communities abroad .
after she began her series of reports , Husseini received death threats at her office almost daily – as well as hundreds of letters of support from readers . as a result of her brave investigations , which included interviews in prisons , many Muslim countries are revising their criminal codes , and the issue has taken center stage internationally .
these women are exactly the kind of leaders that everyone should be cultivating and supporting , rather than overlooking because of a belief that they cannot exist in the Middle East . we would do better to find out more about them than to waste our time on superficial debates about how they – and many others who are just as accomplished – should dress .
what Euro Crisis ?
is it sustained economic decline , high and long-term unemployment , poverty , rampant inflation , a precipitous fall in the exchange rate , fiscal deficits , high borrowing costs , and political dysfunction ? most would agree that a crisis exists if just some of these “ misery indices ” are present .
so , why is there a eurozone crisis , and what defines it ? time and again , it is argued that the single currency does not fit the different needs of its member countries , and that unsustainable economic divergence will ultimately require that the euro be abandoned .
the fatal divergences that are most frequently cited include differences in growth rates , job-creation , and unemployment rates , as well as dramatic disparities in current-account balances , all of which may be traceable to wide deviations in unit labor costs . perceptions of such divergences force considerable risk premiums on problem countries , inevitably resulting in accelerating capital flight to safe havens .
all of these developments are now visible in the eurozone , particularly in its peripheral countries . risk premiums started rising above benign levels in 2009 , and then more strongly in 2011-2012 , while capital flight became rampant in 2011 .
but , if one considers what might underlie capital movements of this sort , suspicion must also fall on unsustainable policies that extend to countries well outside the eurozone . in the wider European Union , countries like the United Kingdom or Hungary are as much afflicted by structural deficiencies as some peripheral eurozone countries are .
moreover , there are countries with government-debt burdens that are as large , if not larger , than those on Europe ’ s periphery – the United States and Japan being prime examples . other countries , like Norway and Switzerland , are running current-account surpluses that exceed 10 % of their GDP , but are resisting currency revaluation .
Germany was uncompetitive when it entered the eurozone , owing to excessive wage and price increases following the country ’ s reunification – a problem that has since been overcome by structural reforms that the country undertook within the single currency . the same is true for the most recent eurozone member , Estonia , whose rigorous wage restraint ensured competitiveness in the single market in a short period of time .
why , then , is there such strong doubt that the euro can survive ? some say that the current efforts to enforce sound policies in the peripheral countries are bound to fail , and that sacrificing democracy in these countries to keep the monetary union intact is too high a price to pay .
who would have believed at this time last year that the fiscal pact adopted in March would have been possible ? and , despite fluctuations , has there not been a considerable reduction in risk premiums for problem countries , without adding to the financing costs of donor countries ?
will debtor countries be able to stick to tough reform programs , or will their citizens reject austerity ? and will donor countries avoid the sort of populist backlash at home that might push them in a protectionist direction ?
for example , transnational migration flows should certainly be made easier and more attractive . high levels of unemployment , particularly among young skilled workers , could be avoided if donor countries that need migrants to invigorate their own workforces were able to attract them .
more immigration would strengthen skills and raise income levels , while reducing distressed countries ’ expenditure on unemployment benefits . greater labor mobility within the EU would also help to create a more open European mindset , and thus weaken old nationalist prejudices .
so , will Europe commit to moving toward political union , and thereby address what has remained missing , despite the single market , the euro , and the Schengen Agreement ’ s elimination of internal borders ?
the model for a future United States of Europe is Switzerland , a country with four languages and ethnicities , fiscally strong sub-national units ( cantons ) , a single first-rate currency , and a federal government and a parliament that exercises genuine , if limited , fiscal authority .
if the EU made the most of the competencies that it already has , and governed more effectively , the Union as a whole could achieve faster economic growth for at least the next decade , with a 2.5 % annual rate not out of reach . more generous support for countries in trouble is essential , because the euro must be preserved ( albeit not necessarily on the base of a larger eurozone ) .
financial markets would be more easily convinced if such support were complemented by the recipient countries ’ acceptance of the fiscal pact , together with technical help to strengthen their governance . in Greece , anti-corruption officers from the US , Italian tax-efficiency specialists , German privatization experts , and Spanish tourism professionals should be made available to accelerate the pace of modernization .
but it recognizes that what Europe ’ s troubled countries need most is not money , but the planning and administrative capacity to spend it effectively . over the last decade , Greece could absorb only a fifth of the EU modernization funds available to it .
whatever Happened to Wage Insurance ?
a lot of public attention and worry nowadays surrounds the new risks that globalization and information technology create for our wages and livelihoods . but there has been far less constructive discussion of new ideas about how to confront these risks .
to be sure , we still sympathize with people who , upon reaching middle age or later , find themselves replaced by lower-paid workers in another part of the world , if not by a computer or a robot . but are we really going to do anything about these risks ?
as then floated , the idea was simple : the government would protect people from the risk of losing their job and being unable to find a new one at the same wage . a government insurance program would pay these people a fraction , say , half , the difference between their old pay and their pay in a new job for a specified period , such as two years .
in 2002 , the Hartz Commission recommended a version of it in Germany . wage insurance programs have been actively talked about or actually implemented in some form in Britain , France , Switzerland , and Ireland .
despite all the intellectual applause , however , wage insurance programs are still not a significant force in the world economy . they should be .
far better , proponents of wage insurance argue , for the training to be carried out by an employer who wants a job done and knows what the employee needs to learn . it seems plausible that two years is long enough for retraining , after which the employee might command a higher wage without a government subsidy .
but governments , fearing the expense of wage insurance if a lot of people exploit it , have not been willing to implement it on a large scale . for example , the US wage insurance program is confined to manufacturing workers over age 50 who are in competitively vulnerable industries and are deemed by the Secretary of Labor to have nontransferable skills .
the weakness of the current wage insurance proposal is that it pays benefits only for a limited period and relies for its long-term effect on the retraining incentives that it creates . in reality , however , losing a high-paying job may be a lifetime event , and the supposed retraining that wage insurance would encourage for a laid-off 50-year-old worker often may be ineffective .
in my 2003 book , New Financial Order : risk in the 21st Century , I proposed a different idea , which I called “ livelihood insurance . ” As the name implies , livelihood insurance is designed to provide more than just a brief respite or a subsidy for retraining .
with livelihood insurance , a private insurer would pay a stream of income to a policyholder if an index of average income in the insured person ’ s occupation and region declines substantially . moreover , this income stream would continue for as long as the index stays down , not just for a couple of years ( or any other arbitrary period ) .
since the premium would be determined by the market , it would be higher in occupations that the market believes to be in danger from outsourcing or technical change . this , in turn , would give workers a tangible warning and an incentive to anticipate job losses before they occur .
both wage and livelihood insurance appear to have important risk management functions . indeed , for the future , it is imperative to think about many new ways , involving both government and the market , to ensure that we manage better the greatest personal risks now faced by workers around the world .
France ’ s German Mirror
Berlin – Berlin ’ s Tegel Airport , which still greets most of the passengers arriving in the capital of Europe ’ s leading economic power , is outdated and provincial . the opening of Schönefeld Airport , transformed into an international hub , has been delayed for more than a year for technical reasons ( a somewhat reassuring challenge to Germany ’ s reputation for efficiency ) .
young Berliners cannot ignore where they come from . yet , perhaps because the past still rings like a warning – and is still physically visible in the topography and architecture of the city today – Berlin is striking in its simplicity , its radiant modernity ( symbolized by the glass dome of the Reichstag , a conception of the British architect Norman Foster ) , and , above all , its intensity .
that positive energy contrasts starkly with the decadent beauty of Paris , a city that is on a path of “ museification . ” Of course , if you can afford to live there , Paris remains a great place to be .
thanks to its moderate housing costs , Berlin has not become , like Paris , a ghetto for the rich . unlike the French , who are handicapped by the high cost of housing , Germans ’ purchasing power is more harmoniously distributed , creating more room for household consumption to contribute to economic growth .
Germany ’ s positive energy is , of course , the result of success translated into confidence , which Chancellor Angela Merkel incarnates with strength and simplicity .
has there been a French president since François Mitterrand who was truly a match for a German chancellor ? if France has replaced Germany as “ the sick man of Europe , ” it is for political reasons , above all : vision , courage , and strength on the northern side of the Rhine , and vacillation , inertia , and weakness on the southern .
German demography cannot be described as the solution to French youth unemployment , as though one could rest on a slogan such as : “ They lack young people , our young people lack jobs – what a perfect match ! ” This widespread sentiment irresponsibly assumes that time is working in favor of France , regardless of whether it implements structural reforms .
France ’ s current direction is a source of deep concern in Germany , whose evolution should be seen in France as a source of inspiration – an example to be emulated , even if the country must not fall into self-flagellation . yet today ’ s debate in France over the German model reminds one eerily of the discussions that followed France ’ s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War .
the major difference now is that the European unification process rules out war – even economic war – between the two countries . on the contrary , in the mirror of Germany , the French must ask themselves fundamental questions .
the places of power in France do not encourage modesty . in his latest book , Days of Power , the former agriculture minister , Bruno Le Maire , writes condescendingly of the building that houses his Danish counterpart in Copenhagen , which he compares to low-income housing .
what Greece Needs to Prosper
new YORK – Some economists overlook the modern idea that a country ’ s prosperity depends on innovation and entrepreneurship . they take the mechanistic view that prosperity is a matter of employment , and that employment is determined by “ demand ” – government spending , household consumption , and investment demand .
looking at Greece , these economists argue that a shift in fiscal policy to “ austerity ” – a smaller public sector – has brought an acute deficiency of demand and thus a depression . but this claim misreads history and exaggerates the power of government spending .
much of the decline in employment in Greece occurred prior to the sharp cuts in spending between 2012 and 2014 – owing , no doubt , to sinking confidence in the government . Greek government spending per quarter climbed to a plateau of around € 13.5 billion ( $ 14.8 billion ) in 2009-2012 , before falling to roughly € 9.6 billion in 2014-2015 .
these findings weigh heavily against the hypothesis that “ austerity ” has brought Greece to its present plight . they indicate that Greece ’ s turn away from the high spending of 2008-2013 is not to blame for today ’ s mass unemployment .
Greece has not departed from past fiscal norms ; it has returned to them . rather than describing current government spending as “ austere , ” it would be more correct to view it as an end to years of fiscal profligacy , culminating in 2013 , when the government ’ s budget deficit reached 12.3 % of GDP and public debt climbed to 175 % of GDP .
the “ demand school ” might respond that , regardless of whether there is fiscal austerity now , increased government spending ( financed , of course , by debt ) would impart a permanent boost to employment . but Greece ’ s recent experience suggests otherwise .
assuming a limit to foreign investors ’ willingness to buy these bonds , Greeks would have to buy them . in an economy unequipped for growth , household wealth relative to wages would soar , and the labor supply would shrink , causing employment to contract .
then the economy ’ s stultifying corporatism – clientelism and cronyism in the public sector and vested interests and entrenched elites in the private sector – would gain a new lease on life . the European left may advocate that , but it would hardly be in Europe ’ s interest .
whether or not the reforms sought by the eurozone members raise the chances that their loans will be repaid , these creditors have a political and economic interest in the monetary union ’ s survival and development . they should also be ready to help Greece with the costs of making the necessary changes .
Greece must dismantle corporatist arrangements and practices that obstruct whatever innovation and entrepreneurship might emerge . nurturing an abundance of imaginative innovators and vibrant entrepreneurs requires embracing a vision of venturesome lives of creativity and discovery .
what Happened to India ?
Chicago – Emerging markets around the world – Brazil , China , India , and Russia , to name the largest – are slowing . one reason is that they continue to be dependent , directly or indirectly , on exports to advanced industrial countries .
in Brazil , low savings and various institutional impediments keep interest rates high and investment low , while the educational system does not serve significant parts of the population well . and Russia , despite a very well educated population , continues to be reliant on commodity industries for economic growth .
hardest to understand , though , is why India is underperforming so much relative to its potential . indeed , annual GDP growth has fallen by five percentage points since 2010 .
it is largely a matter of providing public goods : basic infrastructure like roads , bridges , ports , and power , as well as access to education and basic health care . and , unlike many equally poor countries , India already has a very strong entrepreneurial class , a reasonably large and well-educated middle class , and a number of world-class corporations that can be enlisted in the effort to provide these public goods .
satisfying the demand for such goods is itself a source of growth . but , also , a reliable road creates tremendous additional activity , as trade increases between connected areas , and myriad businesses , restaurants , and hotels spring up along the way .
but the BJP-led coalition lost that election . whether the debacle reflected the BJP ’ s unfortunate choice of coalition partners or its emphasis on growth when too many Indians had not benefited from it , the lesson for politicians was that growth did not provide electoral rewards .
the first , which is harder and takes time , is to increase income-generating capabilities in rural areas , and among the poor , by improving access to education , health care , finance , water , and power . the second is to increase voters ’ spending power through populist subsidies and transfers , which typically tend to be directed toward the politically influential rather than the truly needy .
in the years after the BJP ’ s loss , with a few notable exceptions , India ’ s political class decided that traditional populism was a surer route to re-election . this perception also accorded well with the median ( typically poor ) voter ’ s low expectation of government in India – seeing it as a source of sporadic handouts rather than of reliable public services .
politicians saw little need to vote for further reforms , especially those that would upset powerful vested interests . the lurch toward populism was strengthened when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance concluded that a rural employment-guarantee scheme and a populist farm-loan waiver aided its victory in the 2009 election .
but , while politicians spent the growth dividend on poorly targeted giveaways such as subsidized petrol and cooking gas , the need for further reform only increased . for example , industrialization requires a transparent system for acquiring land from farmers and tribal people , which in turn presupposes much better land-ownership records than India has .
as demand for land and land prices increased , corruption became rampant , with some politicians , industrialists , and bureaucrats using the lack of transparency in land ownership and zoning to misappropriate assets . India ’ s corrupt elites had moved from controlling licenses to cornering newly valuable resources like land .
an eclectic mix of idealistic and opportunistic politicians and NGOs mobilized people against land acquisitions . with investigative journalists getting into the act , land acquisition became a political land mine .
moreover , key institutions , such as the Comptroller and Auditor General and the judiciary , staffed by an increasingly angry middle class , also launched investigations . as evidence emerged of widespread corruption in contracts and resource allocation , ministers , bureaucrats , and high-level corporate officers were arrested , and some have spent long periods in jail .
the collateral effect , however , is that even honest officials are now too frightened to help corporations to navigate India ’ s maze of bureaucracy . as a result , industrial , mining , and infrastructure projects have ground to a halt .
populist government spending and the inability of the supply side of the economy to keep pace has , in turn , led to elevated inflation , while Indian households , worried that no asset looks safe , have taken to investing in gold . because India does not produce much gold itself , these purchases have contributed to an abnormally wide current-account deficit .
if its politicians can take a few steps to show that they can overcome narrow partisan interests to establish the more transparent and efficient government that a middle-income country needs , they could quickly re-energize India ’ s enormous engines of potential growth . otherwise , India ’ s youth , their hopes and ambitions frustrated , could decide to take matters into their own hands .
what Happened to Mohamed al-Hanashi ?
new YORK – Mohammed al-Hanashi was a 31-year-old Yemeni citizen who was held at Guantánamo Bay without charge for seven years . on June 3 , while I was visiting Guantánamo with other journalists , the press office there issued a terse announcement that al-Hanashi had had been found dead in his cell – an “ apparent suicide . ”
because my commercial flight was canceled , I got a ride back to the United States on a military transport . I happened to be seated next to a military physician who had been flown in to do the autopsy on al-Hanashi .
their interiors resemble the inside of a smooth plastic jar ; there are no hard edges ; hooks fold down ; there is no bedding that one can use to strangle oneself . can you bang your head against the wall until you die , theoretically , I asked the doctor ?
( the Geneva Conventions call for this process but the US did not give it any formal recognition ) . as their designated representative , al-Hanashi knew which prisoners had claimed to have been tortured or abused , and by whom .
on January 17 , al-Hanashi , according to his fellow prisoner Binyam Mohamed ( who has since been released ) , was summoned to a meeting with the Admiral of Guantánamo and the head of the Guard Force there . he never returned to his cell .
can you kill yourself in the psych ward ? according to Cortney Busch of Reprieve , a British organization that represents Guantánamo detainees , there is video running on prisoners in the psychiatric ward at all times , and there is a guard posted there continually , too .
the day after al-Hanashi died , the nurse and psychologist had shown a group of journalists of which I was a part an oddly defensive display of how hunger-striking prisoners are bound in restraint chairs when being “ enterally fed ” ( that is , force-fed ) . Al Hanashi , the press office at Guantánamo noted , had formerly been a hunger striker .
it is worth considering how easy it would be to do away with a troublesome prisoner being force-fed by merely adjusting the calorie level . if it is too low , the prisoner will starve , but too high a level can also kill , since deliberate liquid overfeeding by tube , to which Guantánamo prisoners have reported being subjected , causes vomiting , diarrhea , and deadly dehydration that can stop one ’ s heart .
I have been putting questions to Lt. Commander Brook DeWalt , the head spokesman for the Guantánamo press office , about how al-Hanashi died , for eight weeks now . according to the Yemeni embassy in Washington , al-Hanashi ’ s body was repatriated in mid-August .
Al Jazeera has reported that the Yemeni government announced only what the US had – that al-Hanashi had died from “ asphyxiation . ” When I noted to DeWalt that self-strangulation was impossible , he said he would get back to me when the inquiry – now including a Naval criminal investigation – was completed .
an investigation by the military of the death of its own prisoners violates the Geneva Conventions , which demand that illness , transfer , and death of prisoners be registered independently with a neutral authority ( such as the ICRC ) , and that deaths be investigated independently . if governments let no outside entity investigate the circumstances of such deaths , what will keep them from “ disappearing ” whomever they take into custody , for whatever reason ?
I sent DeWalt a copy of the relevant section of the Geneva Conventions and asked how the US military ’ s handling of al-Hanashi ’ s death conforms to it . actually , I sent it twice .
Binyam Mohamed told the Associated Press that al-Hanashi was a positive person ( and , one can assume , a natural leader ) who would never consider suicide . he had been in custody for seven years without a lawyer , and killed himself just two weeks after having finally been assigned one ?
what happened to Mohamed al-Hanashi , and why ? the fact that no one can answer this question yet means that even in Barack Obama ’ s America , as in Stalin ’ s Russia or Ahmadinejad ’ s Iran , people can simply be disappeared without trial .
the world ’ s law-abiding governments and ordinary citizens should call and email DeWalt , the Pentagon , and the White House press office to demand answers . a young man with a great deal of potentially compromising information died under suspicious circumstances in US custody .

Ireland and the Austerity Debate
Dublin – Both sides of the austerity debate that is now gripping economists and policymakers cite Ireland ’ s experience as evidence for their case . and , however much they try to position the country as a poster-child , neither side is able to convince the other .
irresponsible risk-taking and excessive greed outpaced prudential regulation and supervision . the banking system ended up fueling massive speculation , including a huge run-up in real-estate prices , only to be brought to its knees when the bubbles popped .
unlike the many Irish households that lost jobs and part of their wealth , the banks were deemed to be “ too big to fail , ” so Ireland ’ s political elites intervened with state funding . but , by under-estimating both the domestic and international aspects of the problem , the authorities transformed a banking problem into a national tragedy .
growth collapsed ; unemployment spiked . lacking opportunities , emigration increased – a vivid reminder of how economic crises have wreaked havoc on the country ’ s demographics throughout its history .
investors withdrew in droves from what was once deemed the “ Celtic Tiger . ” The government had no choice but to request a bailout from the “ troika ” – the International Monetary Fund , the European Central Bank , and the European Commission – thereby transferring an important component of national economic governance to an ad hoc , fragile , and sometimes feuding group of institutions .
first , two democratically-elected governments have steadfastly implemented the agreed austerity programs with little need for waivers and modifications – and thus without the associated political drama . second , despite enduring considerable pain , Irish society has stuck with the program , staging few of the street protests that have been common in other austerity-hit countries .
all of this puts Ireland in the middle of three important issues raised in the austerity debates : whether orthodox policy , with its heavy emphasis on immediate budget cuts , can restore conditions for growth , employment gains , and financial stability ; whether the benefits of eurozone membership still outweigh the costs for countries that must restructure their economies ; and how a small , open economy should strategically position itself in today ’ s world .
all of this , they argue , provides the basis for sustainable growth and declining unemployment . Ireland , they conclude , was right to stay in the eurozone , especially because small , open economies that are unanchored can be easily buffeted by a fluid global economy .
unemployment remains far too high , with alarming levels of long-term and youth joblessness . public debt remains too high as well , and , making matters worse , much more of it is now owed to official rather than private creditors ( which would complicate debt restructuring should it become necessary ) .
the critics reject the argument that small , open economies are necessarily better off in a monetary union , pointing to how well Switzerland is coping . and they lament that eurozone membership means that Ireland ’ s “ internal devaluations , ” which involve significant cuts in real wages , have not yet run their course .
yet there is some good analytical news . Ireland provides insights that are helpful in understanding how sociopolitical systems , including economically devastated countries like Cyprus and Greece , have coped so far with shocks that were essentially unthinkable just a few years ago .
on my current visit , most of the Irish citizens with whom I have spoken say that the country had no alternative but to follow the path of austerity . while they appreciate the urgent need for growth and jobs , they believe that this can be achieved only after Ireland ’ s finances are put back on a sound footing .
Ireland ’ s accumulation of wealth during its Celtic Tiger period , when the country surged toward the top of Europe ’ s economic league table , has also been an effective shock absorber . this , together with fears about being left out in the geopolitical cold ( despite the country ’ s historical links with Britain and America ) , dampens Irish enthusiasm for economic experiments outside the eurozone .
efforts to regain national control of the country ’ s destiny , the Irish seem to believe , must take time . in some of Europe ’ s other struggling countries , however , citizens may well prove less patient .
what is Full Employment ?
the relatively tight labor market is causing wages to rise at an accelerating rate , because employers must pay more to attract and retain employees . this has important implications for policymakers – and not just at the Federal Reserve .
consider this : average hourly earnings in May were 2.3 % higher than in May 2014 ; but , since the beginning of this year , hourly earnings are up 3.3 % , and in May alone rose at a 3.8 % rate – a clear sign of full employment . the acceleration began in 2013 as labor markets started to tighten .
the link between wages and prices is currently being offset by the sharp decline in the price of oil and gasoline relative to a year ago , and by the strengthening of the dollar relative to other currencies . but , as these factors ’ impact on the overall price level diminishes , the inflation rate will rise more rapidly .
accelerating wage growth implies that the economy is now at a point at which increases in demand created by easier monetary policy or expansionary fiscal policy would not achieve a sustained rise in output and employment . instead , this demand would be channeled into higher wages and prices .
some would say that the United States is not at full employment , because 8.7 million people – about 6 % of those who are employed – are looking for work . there are millions more who would like to work but are not actively looking , because they believe that there are no available jobs for people like themselves .
but , for the Fed , it is , in the sense that excessively easy monetary policy can no longer achieve a sustained increase in employment . at the same time , other types of policies that change incentives or remove barriers can lead to increased employment and higher real incomes , without raising wage and price inflation .
among those in this age range who have less than a high school education , 35 % are not employed . programs to provide market-relevant education and training should be able to raise employment among this group .
but experience shows that the decision to retire or to work fewer hours is influenced by the compensation that members of this group receive . and this amount partly reflects the fact that employed people who collect Social Security and Medicare are subject to the payroll tax that finances them .
the payroll tax paid by employees is 6.65 % ( employers pay the same rate ) , and is in addition to the personal income tax . moreover , because of the complex rules that govern the level of Social Security benefits , the older worker who pays this payroll tax is likely to receive no extra benefits .
for many older workers , the choice is not whether to work , but how much . we now have less than full employment in the sense that the payroll tax encourages older workers to work fewer hours than they otherwise would .
first , for some individuals , working fewer hours reduces incomes enough to entitle them to a larger government subsidy for health insurance . second , some employers are being incented to reduce the number of working hours for individual employees , because , above a specified number , Obamacare imposes a larger burden on them .
as the minimum wage is increased , employers ’ incentive to substitute equipment or more skilled employees strengthens . this reduction in the demand for low-skilled workers could be offset by taking into account the hourly equivalent of transfer payments when calculating the minimum wage .
for example , someone who receives $ 8,000 a year in transfer payments ( such as food stamps , housing assistance , and the Earned Income Tax Credit ) might be deemed to have received the equivalent of $ 4 an hour toward meeting the minimum wage . that individual ’ s combined income would be achieved with a lower cost to the employer , increasing the individual ’ s ability to find employment .
the basic point is that employment can be increased , and unemployment decreased , by removing barriers to job creation and reducing marginal tax rates . by contrast , increasing demand by prolonging easy monetary policy or expanding fiscal spending is likely to result in rising inflation rather than rising employment .
what is the Deficit Endgame ?
Reykjavik – No one yet has any real idea about when the global financial crisis will end , but one thing is certain : government budget deficits are headed into the stratosphere . investors in the coming years will need to be persuaded to hold mountains of new debt .
interest rates will rise to compensate investors both for having to accept a larger share of government bonds in their portfolio and for an increasing risk that governments will be tempted to inflate away the value of their debts , or even default .
in research that Carmen Reinhart and I have done on the history of financial crises , we find that public debt typically doubles , even adjusting for inflation , in the three years following a crisis . many nations , large and small , are now well on the way to meeting this projection .
President Barack Obama ’ s new budget calls for a stunning $ 1.75 trillion deficit in the United States , a multiple of the previous record . even those countries that are not actively engaged in a fiscal orgy are seeing their surpluses collapse and their deficits soar , mainly in the face of falling tax revenues .
indeed , few governments have submitted remotely realistic budget projections , typically relying on overly rosy economic scenarios . unfortunately , in 2009 , the global economy will not be a bed of roses .
exports have collapsed throughout Asia , including Korea , Japan , and Singapore . arguably India , and to a lesser extent Brazil , have been holding out a bit better . but few emerging markets have reached a stage at which they can withstand a sustained collapse in the developed economies , much less serve as substitute engines of global growth .
with the credit crisis still making it difficult for many small and medium-size businesses to obtain even the minimal level of financing necessary to maintain inventories and conduct trade , global GDP is on a precipice in 2009 . there is a real possibility that global growth will register its first contraction since World War II .
but , with debts in many countries rising to 80 % or 90 % of GDP , and with today ’ s low interest rates clearly a temporary phenomenon , trouble is brewing . many of the countries that are piling on massive quantities of debt to bail out their banks have only tepid medium term growth prospects , raising real questions of solvency and sustainability
but as debts mount , and global interest rates rise , investors will become rightly nervous about the risk of debt restructuring . other countries , such as Ireland , Britain , and the US , started with a much stronger fiscal position , but may not be much better off when the smoke clears .
exchange rates are another wild card . Asian central banks are still nervously clinging to the dollar . but with the US printing debt and money like it is going out of style , it would appear the euro is set to appreciate against the dollar two or three years down the road , if the euro is still around , that is .
as debt mounts and the recession lingers , we are surely going to see a number of governments trying to lighten their load through financial repression , higher inflation , partial default , or a combinations of all three . unfortunately , the endgame to the great recession of the 2000 ’ s will not be a pretty picture .
what is the West ?
the “ clash of civilizations , ” basically the West against the rest , is supposed to describe the world as it is . in reality , the West is vague enough to include a vast array of areas without describing their unifying characteristics .
what does Westernization mean ? why is Japan considered Western and China not ?
it probably first established itself as a mindset when the Greeks , 25 centuries ago , perceived themselves as Western versus the Oriental Persians . since the West has lost any clear territorial basis since then , the phrase “ the West ” has become a universal not a local notion .
to be Western or Westernized , above all , is a mindset which does not coincide with any continent , nor with any specific nation or religion . Huntington ’ s mistake , it seems , was to contain the West inside national borders : there is no map of the West .
no map can work when some Asian nations are Western ( Japan , Taiwan ) , when non-Western groups ( Muslims in Europe ) live in supposedly Western countries , when some Eastern countries are partially Westernized and some Western countries ( Russia ) are not fully Westernized . eventually it looks easier to define the mental borders of the West than its territorial borders .
I believe that the West is a mindset defined by three fundamental traits that cannot easily be found in the so-called Eastern civilizations : a passion for innovation , a capacity for self-criticism , and gender equality .
the non-Westerner , however , would rather place tradition above innovation . but innovation as a fundamental value explains the scientific breakthroughs of the West versus the East . it explains unavoidable conflicts with conservative non-Western societies and it also explains what we should call ‘ the Westernization of the West . ’
the West keeps destroying its own traditions , including its religions . the economist Joseph Schumpeter defined this process as one of “ creative destruction . ” The term could be applied to all walks of life in the West .
in most if not all non-Western civilizations , pride and self love exclude self-criticism or at least the criticism of one ’ s civilization as such . a true Muslim or Chinese scholar cannot be defined as a true Chinese or a true Muslim by being critical of his own world .
the Western scholar remains perfectly legitimate when putting to death Western values : there is no Chinese or Muslim Nietzsche claiming that his own God is dead . is there a Chinese or a Muslim Montaigne ready to write that the “ Indian savages ” may be wiser than us , as Montaigne did in 16th century France ?
of course there must be some Chinese or Muslim Montaigne or Nietzsche , but they would not be considered beacons of their civilizations . self-criticism , not self-love , and cultural relativism are the nuts and bolts of the Western mindset .
this has not always been so . in the ancient Greek , Jewish , and Christian religions , women were perceived as inferior to men . but this notion has been contentious in the West for centuries . nowadays , gender equality has become the norm .
if we accept the above definition of the West as a mindset , this leaves open three major questions : can the East be modernized without being Westernized ? where do we draw the line between West and East ?
so far , there is no case in history of non-Western modernization ; the discourse on Asian values , initially started in Singapore , is basically a political discourse . it is after retooling their mindset towards innovation and self-criticism that Asian countries have become modern .
contemporary Koreans or Japanese remain fully Korean or Japanese but are closer to a Westerner than they would be to their own ancestors . similarly , a modern Egyptian or a modern Saudi will be more on par with a French or an American than they would be with an ancient Arab .
such a debate does take place within all Eastern societies , which leads us to the real clash of civilizations : all societies today are fragmented between Westernizers and non-Westernizers . this clash within civilizations on what modernization means is more significant than Huntington ’ s alleged conflict between geographical entities .
vast groups who live in the West , Western and non-Western fundamentalists , fight the unending Westernization process in the name of tradition . many would like to stop the engine by using various guises like ecology or identity , but a Western society where you could not start your day by asking ‘ What &apos;s new ? ’ would not be Western any more .
what Lies Ahead in 2011 ?
on the other side , Europe and the United States face stagnation – indeed , a Japanese-style malaise – and stubbornly high unemployment . the problem in the advanced countries is not a jobless recovery , but an anemic recovery – or worse , the possibility of a double-dip recession .
this two-track world poses some unusual risks . while Asia ’ s economic output is too small to pull up growth in the rest of the world , it may be enough to push up commodity prices .
given the high levels of excess capacity and unemployment in Europe and America , quantitative easing is unlikely to trigger a bout of inflation . it could , however , increase anxieties about future inflation , leading to higher long-term interest rates – precisely the opposite of the Fed ’ s goal .
this is not the only , or even the most important , downside risk facing the global economy . the gravest threat comes from the wave of austerity sweeping the world , as governments , particularly in Europe , confront the large deficits brought on by the Great Recession , and as anxieties about some countries ’ ability to meet their debt payments contributes to financial-market instability .
the outcome of premature fiscal consolidation is all but foretold : growth will slow , tax revenues will diminish , and the reduction in deficits will be disappointing . and , in our globally integrated world , the slowdown in Europe will exacerbate the slowdown in the US , and vice versa .
a large-scale public-investment program would stimulate employment in the short term , and growth in the long term , leading in the end to a lower national debt . but financial markets demonstrated their shortsightedness in the years preceding the crisis , and are doing so once again , by applying pressure for spending cuts , even if that implies reducing badly needed public investments .
moreover , political gridlock will ensure that little is done about the other festering problems confronting the American economy : mortgage foreclosures are likely to continue unabated ( legal complications aside ) ; small and medium-sized enterprises are likely to continue to be starved of funds ; and the small and medium-sized banks that traditionally provide them with credit are likely to continue to struggle to survive .
Europe has finally managed to come to the rescue of Greece and Ireland . in the run up to the crisis , both were governed by right-wing governments marked by crony capitalism or worse , demonstrating once again that free-market economics didn ’ t work in Europe any better than it did in the US .
in Greece , as in the US , a new government was left to clean up the mess . the Irish government that encouraged reckless bank lending and the creation of a property bubble was , perhaps not surprisingly , no more adept in managing the economy after the crisis that it was before .
politics aside , property bubbles leave in their wake a legacy of debt and excess capacity in real estate that is not easily rectified – especially when politically connected banks resist restructuring mortgages .
to me , attempting to discern the economic prospects for 2011 is not a particularly interesting question : the answer is bleak , with little upside potential and a lot of downside risk . more importantly , how long will it take Europe and America to recover , and can Asia ’ s seemingly export-dependent economies continue to grow if their historical markets languish ?
my best bet is that these countries will maintain rapid growth as they shift their economic focus to their vast and untapped domestic markets . this will require considerable restructuring of their economies , but China and India are both dynamic , and proved their resilience in their response to the Great Recession .
in both cases , the underlying problem is insufficient aggregate demand . the ultimate irony is that there are simultaneously excess capacity and vast unmet needs – and policies that could restore growth by using the former to address the latter .
the problem is politics : in the US , the Republican Party would rather see President Barack Obama fail than the economy succeed . in Europe , 27 countries with different interests and perspectives are pulling in different directions , without enough solidarity to compensate .
in both Europe and America , the free-market ideology that allowed asset bubbles to grow unfettered – markets always know best , so government must not intervene – now ties policymakers ’ hands in designing effective responses to the crisis . one might have thought that the crisis itself would undermine confidence in that ideology .
if politics is the problem in Europe and America , only political changes are likely to restore them to growth . or else they can wait until the overhang of excess capacity diminishes , capital goods become obsolete , and the economy ’ s internal restorative forces work their gradual magic .
India ’ s Outrage
new DELHI – Last year ended for India on a note of public outrage that has burdened the country with anger , frustration , and pessimism . the cause , as all the world knows , was the fatally brutal rape of a young woman on a moving bus , after which she and her male companion – himself beaten nearly to death – were thrown , naked , into the street on a freezing night .
the savagery and wanton cruelty of the attack shocked the country to its core . but there is more behind the spontaneous protests that have choked the great central vistas of Delhi ( to such an extent that the government was forced to change the venue for meetings with visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin ) .
the anger that has poured onto the streets of Delhi and many other Indian cities was fueled by a great accumulated discontent – at the bestial rape and murder of that still-unnamed woman , yes , but also at pervasive public and private corruption , the absence of governance and accountability , and much more . years of pent-up rage are now flowing out .
the government failed to prevent the crime , then failed again when its unresponsive , inefficient , and crooked police force was unable to respond appropriately . a wholly moribund and sclerotic administration simply did not know where its duty lay .
when protests erupted , the government , in a fit of blind idiocy , set the police upon peaceful protesters , men and women , with long batons , water cannon , and tear gas . this heavy-handedness of course resolved nothing .
not one government official had the courage , skill , or decency to rise to the occasion . the opposition , too , floundered , doing no more than simply faulting the ruling establishment . &amp; # 160 ;
after an unconscionably long delay of seven days , Prime Minister Manmohan Singh finally broke his incomprehensible silence about the rape . but his public statement offered no answers and no balm – indeed , nothing but platitudes .
Prime Minister , it is not all right . ” Clearly , Machiavelli was correct : for a political leader , the people ’ s contempt is worse than their hatred .
it was there that she died – some say that she arrived already brain-dead . her body was then hurriedly flown back to India , where it was quietly , almost surreptitiously , cremated .
a blunt question is now being asked frequently and openly : “ Is this India ’ s Tahrir Square ? ” Even if it is not , how can an internally roiled India respond adequately to its many external tests , the severity of which was underscored recently by Pakistani troops ’ killing of two Indian soldiers along the Line of Control in Kashmir .
meanwhile , as India flounders , Northeast Asia has been astir choosing new leaders , who have now been installed in China , Japan , and North and South Korea . with an assertive China , ongoing regime change in Myanmar , a troubled Bangladesh , a constitutionally stymied Nepal , and continuing ethnic tensions in Sri Lanka , India ’ s eastern challenges are many and mighty .
but they are even more severe to India ’ s west , with Pakistan heading into elections ( one hopes ) in the spring of 2013 , and NATO troops withdrawing from Afghanistan . Indian diplomacy faces a time of trial in both countries .
where does India , which remains dependent on Middle Eastern energy , stand on that region ’ s many crises ? how will it address the nuclear issue in Iran – a country with which it has close historical , cultural , and economic ties – or the civil war in Syria , the rise of Salafism in Egypt , and the Israel-Palestine standoff ?
India is running high current-account and fiscal deficits ; food-price inflation is in the double digits ; and the rupee has weakened . as for trade with China , The Economist points out that “ for every dollar ’ s worth of exports to China &#91; principally raw materials &#93; , India imports three . ”
clearly , the current government is unable to bring about any of the necessary changes . a possible answer lies in an early election : a new mandate for an India that is in desperate need of renewal .
what McCain and Obama Ignore
Princeton – Barack Obama worked for three years as a community organizer on Chicago ’ s blighted South Side , so he knows all about the real poverty that exists in America . he knows that in one of the world ’ s richest nations , 37 million people live in poverty , a far higher proportion than in Europe ’ s wealthy nations .
perhaps not enough of the poor vote , or they will vote Democratic anyway . moreover , his researchers presumably have told him that independent middle-class voters are more likely to be won over by appeals to their wallets than to concern for America ’ s poor .
again , Obama has both the background – with his family ties to Kenya – and a promising policy , to increase America ’ s foreign assistance to $ 50 billion by 2012 , using the money to stabilize failing states and bring sustainable growth to Africa . ( currently , of all the OECD donor nations , only Greece gives a lower percentage of its gross national income than the United States does . )
but when Obama ’ s running mate , Joe Biden , was asked , in his debate with his Republican counterpart , Sarah Palin , what proposals an Obama-Biden administration might have to scale back as a result of the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout , the only specific proposal he mentioned was the increase in foreign assistance . McCain has never gotten down to specifics about how much foreign aid he would like the US to give .
both candidates refer to deaths of American military personnel in Iraq , but there has been less attention to the war ’ s civilian causalities . in her debate with Biden , Palin actually attacked Obama for saying that , in her words , “ All we ’ re doing in Afghanistan is air-raiding villages and killing civilians . ”
here , the candidates ’ goals are virtually identical : they both support a cap-and-trade system to make deep cuts in US greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 . Obama wants the goal to be an 80 % reduction and McCain says 66 % , but , since the next president will leave office no later than 2016 , that difference is irrelevant .
interestingly , one ethical issue on which neither candidate has campaigned has been shown to have the potential to move voters . a group called Defenders of Wildlife has been running an ad graphically highlighting Palin ’ s support for shooting wolves from aircraft .
what Money Can Buy
Chicago – In an interesting recent book , What Money Can ’ t Buy : the Moral Limits of the Market , the Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel points to the range of things that money can buy in modern societies and gently tries to stoke our outrage at the market ’ s growing dominance . is he right that we should be alarmed ?
while Sandel worries about the corrupting nature of some monetized transactions ( do kids really develop a love of reading if they are bribed to read books ? ) , he is also concerned about unequal access to money , which makes trades using money inherently unequal . more generally , he fears that the expansion of anonymous monetary exchange erodes social cohesion , and argues for reducing money ’ s role in society .
in the United States , some companies pay the unemployed to stand in line for free public tickets to congressional hearings . they then sell the tickets to lobbyists and corporate lawyers who have a business interest in the hearing but are too busy to stand in line .
clearly , public hearings are an important element of participatory democracy . all citizens should have equal access .
but is a single mother with a high-pressure job and three young children as equally endowed with spare time as a student on summer vacation ? and is society better off if she , the chief legal counsel for a large corporation , spends much of her time standing in line ?
if we want to increase society ’ s productive efficiency , people ’ s willingness to pay with money is a reasonable indicator of how much they will gain if they have access to the hearing . auctioning seats for money makes sense – the lawyer contributes more to society by preparing briefs than by standing in line .
I think part of our discomfort has to do with the circumstances in which the transaction takes place . what kind of society do we live in if people have to sell their organs to survive ?
possibly , if it makes society work harder to ensure that people are never driven to the circumstances that would make them contemplate selling a vital organ . but possibly not , if it allows society to ignore the underlying problem , either moving the trade underground , or forcing people in such circumstances to resort to worse remedies .
the buyer is giving up only money – perhaps earned on a lucky stock trade or at an overpaid job . if that money had been earned by selling a portion of a lung , or represented savings painfully accumulated during years of backbreaking work , we might consider the exchange more equal .
I need know nothing about the dollar bill I receive to be able to use it . but , because money ’ s anonymity obscures its provenance , it may be socially less acceptable as a medium of payment for some objects .
but money has many virtues in facilitating transactions – hence its ubiquitous use . so , perhaps the more important message is that society ’ s tolerance for monetization is proportional to the legitimacy accorded to the distribution of money .
the more people believe that it is the hardworking and the deserving who have money , the more they are willing to tolerate transactions for money ( though some transactions remain beyond the pale ) . but if people believe that the moneyed are primarily those who are well connected or crooked , their tolerance for monetary transactions falls .
rather than focusing on prohibiting monetary transactions , perhaps a more important lesson imparted by Sandel ’ s examples is that we should work continuously to improve the perceived legitimacy of money ’ s distribution .
the Moral Limits of Markets
Tokyo – Today , there are very few things that money can ’ t buy .
if you are sentenced to a jail term in Santa Barbara , California , and don ’ t like the standard accommodations , you can buy a prison-cell upgrade for about $ 90 per night .
if you want to help to prevent the tragic fact that , each year , thousands of babies are born to drug-addicted mothers , you can contribute to a charity that uses a market mechanism to ameliorate the problem : a $ 300 cash grant to any drug-addicted woman willing to be sterilized .
the company hires homeless people and others in need of work to wait in line – overnight if necessary . just before the hearing begins , the paying customer can take his or her line-stander ’ s place in the queue , and claim a front-row seat in the hearing room .
some would say no ; people should be free to spend their money to buy whatever someone else is willing to sell . others believe that there are some things that money should not be able to buy .
to answer questions such as these , we need to pose a bigger question : what role should money and markets play in a good society ?
asking this question , and debating it politically , is more important than ever . the last three decades have witnessed a quiet revolution , as markets and market-oriented thinking have reached into spheres of life previously governed by non-market values : family life and personal relations ; health and education ; environmental protection and criminal justice ; national security and civic life .
almost without realizing it , we have drifted from having market economies to becoming market societies . the difference is this : a market economy is a tool – a valuable and effective tool – for organizing productive activity .
if the main advantages of affluence were the ability to afford yachts and fancy vacations , inequality would matter less than it does today . but , as money comes to govern access to education , health care , political influence , and safe neighborhoods , life becomes harder for those of modest means .
some object to it on the grounds that it typically exploits the poor , for whom the choice to sell their bodies may not be truly voluntary . but others object on the grounds that reducing sex to a commodity is inherently degrading and objectifying .
we don ’ t allow a free market in votes , even though such a market would arguably be “ efficient , ” in the economist ’ s sense of the term . many people don ’ t use their votes , so why let them go to waste ?
the best argument against a market in votes is that the vote is not a piece of private property ; rather , it is a public responsibility . to treat a vote as an instrument of profit would be to degrade it , to corrupt its meaning as an expression of civic duty .
but , if a market in votes is objectionable because it corrupts democracy , what about systems of campaign finance ( including the one currently in place in the United States ) that give wealthy donors a disproportionate voice in elections ? the reason to reject a market in votes – &amp; # 160 ; preserving the integrity of democracy – may be a reason to limit financial contributions to political candidates as well .
to decide whether selling prison-cell upgrades corrupts the meaning of criminal justice , we have to decide what purpose criminal punishment should serve . to decide whether we should allow the buying and selling of human organs for transplantation , or hire mercenaries to fight our wars , we have to think through hard questions about human dignity and civic responsibility .
but that is a mistake . our reluctance to engage morally contested questions in politics has left us ill-equipped to deliberate about one of the most important issues of our time : where do markets serve the public good , and where do they not belong ?
what Next after Failed Sanctions on Iran ?
the approval of fresh sanctions on Iran marks the third time that the United Nations Security Council has been galvanized to stem the Islamic Republic ’ s feared uranium enrichment efforts . unfortunately , the new sanctions are unlikely to be any more effective than the first two rounds .
the December 2006 resolution curbed international assistance to Iran in mastering the nuclear fuel cycle . the March 2007 resolution called for “ vigilance and restraint ” in the sale of heavy weapons to Iran and avoidance of new grants , financial assistance , or concessional loans .
between 2003 and 2007 the US Treasury Department brought litigation against 94 companies for violating the ban against trade and investment in Iran . the State Department imposed sanctions 111 times against foreign entities that engaged in proliferation or terrorism-related activities with Iran . and both departments have used their power to freeze financial assets or access to the US financial system .
in 1994 , Iran exported $ 37 billion in goods ; by 2007 , the figure had nearly doubled , to $ 70 billion . in roughly the same period , Iran ’ s imports also soared , from $ 22 billion in 1994 to $ 45 billion in 2006 .
evaluating two decades of US sanctions to curb Iran ’ s nuclear appetite , the US Congress ’ s Government Accountability Office recently concluded that the results are “ unclear , ” adding with candid obliqueness that “ some evidence , such as foreign firms signing contracts to invest in Iran ’ s energy and Iran ’ s continued proliferation efforts , raise questions about the extent of the sanctions ’ impact . ”
not only have sanctions failed to halt Iran ’ s fuel cycle programs , but so have other avenues . the European Union ’ s multiple offers of political and economic inducements went nowhere , as did cajoling by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
to be sure Iran offered , in 2005 and subsequently , to tether its program to international co-management , which arguably could have placed resident international monitors on site . but both the international community and Iran failed to follow through , and now that opportunity has increasingly become moot as Iranian engineers gain confidence in their handiwork .
some hope that the next US administration can stem Iran ’ s nuclear ambitions through bilateral diplomacy . but Europe ’ s negotiating experience raises doubts about that prospect , as Iran remains unequivocal about never abandoning its nuclear fuel cycle program .
but the US military would have to be able to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz , through which much of the world ’ s oil supply passes . a halt in Iran ’ s oil exports alone would dramatically upset international oil markets , and the Iranian leadership would likely dig in its heels to continue , if not accelerate , nuclear development .
second , while a military strike would slow Iran ’ s nuclear program , facilities could be rebuilt in the absence of inspectors to find and destroy remnants , regime change , and / or military occupation . moreover , the attack shock could trigger Iranian vengeance regionally and elsewhere , with a global economic impact far exceeding that implied by a blockade .
in that event , there remains the hope that mutual nuclear deterrence will promote mutual common sense . absent a dramatic improvement in the Middle East ’ s grim political landscape , the failure of deterrence would bring the sum of all the fears of our nuclear age upon us .
what Next After the Gaza Withdrawal ?
the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the evacuation of Jewish settlers from Gaza , after 38 years of occupation , is the most recent proof of the limits of military power , even when that power is overwhelming . now is the time to take stock of the lessons learned from the years of occupation and resistance in order to understand what Israelis and Palestinians should do next .
to begin with , it is imperative to understand how much credit Palestinians can credibly claim for the Israeli withdrawal . true , Palestinian resistance and sacrifices were a contributing factor in Ariel Sharon ’ s decision to reverse a policy he had espoused for decades .
but unilateralism is not a rational long-term and effective policy , for it will not lead to a genuine and lasting peace in the Middle East . just as President Bush has discovered in Iraq , Sharon will also be forced to acknowledge the limits of his strategy .
unilateralism seems very expedient to shortsighted politicians , for it obviates the need for what they perceive as the mess of actual negotiations – that is , meeting their counterparts face to face and discovering the human results of their policies . going it alone also seems politically advantageous domestically , because leaders can decide how much and how far they want to carry out a particular policy .
to be fair , unilateralism is convenient not only for a reluctant Israeli prime minister who does not wish to make substantial compromises during negotiations ; it is also attractive to hard-line Palestinians who regard multilateralism as a means of pressing them to make unpopular concessions .
there is no doubt that the evacuation of Jewish settlers in areas that Israelis consider part of their God-given territory represents a huge ideological reversal . but after years of preaching and practicing one of Zionism ’ s main tenets , will the removal of settlements continue in the West Bank , or will this be a one-time exception ?
Palestinians , for their part , will be expected to answer questions – in deeds , not just in words – about their ability to build a modern pluralistic state . how will the Palestinian body politic deal with the growing power of the Islamic movements that undoubtedly will expect a significant share of power in post-withdrawal Gaza ?
according to the Palestinian Economic Council for Reconstruction and Development ( PECDAR ) , annual per capita income in Gaza continues to average roughly $ 700 , while Israelis enjoy incomes averaging a $ 16,000 per capita . in the absence of relatively well-paying jobs , what will happen to the lines of unemployed Gazans ?
while the economic situation in Gaza is a critical issue , the future of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will be determined mainly by the next steps in the peace process . permanent-status issues concerning borders , the West Bank , Jerusalem , and refugees must be dealt with bilaterally .
they cannot continue to sit on the sidelines . Washington ’ s quixotic decision to call Israel ’ s unilateral move part of the road map has failed to convince many Palestinians . the prevailing opinion among Palestinians is that the road map will be put into deep freeze once the Israelis complete their Gaza withdrawal .
but the Palestinian and Israeli peoples , their leaders , and the international community must all respond to the challenges that will follow . most importantly , the future of the conflict and the chances for genuine peace in the region will depend on understanding the limits of offensive military power , defensive resistance , and unilateralism .
what Next After the Likud Referendum ?
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon &apos;s proposal for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and part of the West Bank has been overwhelmingly defeated by a referendum within his own party , Likud , in what seems to be a humiliating defeat . yet this is likely to have little or no effect on Sharon &apos;s intention to carry through with the plan .
at first , this seems surprising , since he said before the referendum that he would abide by its outcome . but Sharon is 75 years old and probably within two years of retirement .
moreover , Sharon made sure that his main political rivals - notably former Prime Minister Benjamin ( Bibi ) Netanyahu - supported his plan . they are now in no position to challenge him as the champions of the opposition within Likud .
so while some members may walk out , Sharon can easily hold on to control of the party . in addition , many Sharon supporters , torn by what they saw as the plan &apos;s combination of costs and benefits , stayed home or even voted against it , but still want Sharon as their leader .
small right-wing parties in his coalition have already announced that his determination to do so will make them walk out of the government . Sharon will then turn to the leader of the opposition , 80-year-old former prime minister Shimon Peres , to form a national unity government .
having the army uproot Jewish settlements - with inevitable scenes of settlers resisting and being dragged off - will be a traumatic event for the country . the plan also entails considerable strategic risks , which , probably more than the prospect of uprooted settlements , account for the large &quot; no &quot; by Likud members .
today , most Israelis believe that this step , though justified on strategic grounds in the face of constant attacks by the Lebanese group Hizbollah , convinced Palestinians that violence worked . in the same manner , a withdrawal from Gaza , many people worry , will bring increased anarchy there and a rise in overall terrorist attacks .
but convinced - as are most Israelis - that there is no Palestinian partner ready to negotiate seriously and implement its promises , the prime minister wants to prepare for an extended interim period . assuming that terrorist attacks against Israel are going to continue under any circumstances , he seeks to improve the country &apos;s strategic position to handle this war .
combined with the long-completed security fence around the Gaza Strip and one being built near Israel &apos;s border with the West Bank , pulling out of the most exposed positions is intended to reduce casualties and the number of clashes with the Palestinians . a secondary intention is to show the world that Israel is ready to withdraw from most of the remaining territories it captured in 1967 in exchange for real peace .
while demanding an Israeli withdrawal for years , the Palestinian leadership opposes Sharon &apos;s plan , arguing it is intended to create permanent borders . nevertheless , if implemented , Sharon &apos;s proposal would leave them in control of about 99 percent of the Gaza Strip and roughly 50 percent of the West Bank .
if it appears that the withdrawal will proceed and Sharon can assemble a government to implement it , the Palestinian side will then face a major challenge . will it be able to put together an effective governmental authority to rule the Gaza Strip , or will that area dissolve into bloody battles among Palestinian factions and a staging area for attacks into Israel that will bring reprisal raids ?
local Fatah officials want support from their leader , Yassir Arafat , to take firm control of the territory . but Arafat has shown a willingness to let groups act as they please , apparently believing that continuing unrest will bring international sympathy and intervention on his behalf .
he has been the only leader his movement has ever known , having led Fatah for 40 years and the Palestinians as a whole for 35 years . with no apparent successor , his departure from the scene will bring a massive and unpredictable shake-up in Palestinian politics .
the Israeli government &apos;s projection has been that both the withdrawal and the security fence will be completed by the end of 2005 . Sharon &apos;s retirement is likely to come within another twelve months , with a new opposition leader having to be chosen as well .
thus , while the Likud referendum seems to have left the Israeli-Palestinian dispute at yet another impasse , both sides are on the verge of enormous changes .
what Next for Europe ?
it began well , when Spanish voters approved the draft European Union constitution , but it turned sour when French and Dutch voters spurned it soon after . those votes partly reflected displeasure with domestic policies , and partly disappointment with the way governments conduct European affairs .
within days of the votes , they failed to agree on the EU budget for 2007-13 . French and British leaders engaged in a heated quarrel that derailed the subsequent summit , before Britain assumed the rotating six-month EU presidency in July .
besides burying the draft constitution , it has largely sidestepped the budget issue . chances that it gets the budget approved this year are slim , and , unless the dispute is resolved soon , the Union will not have an operational budget by 2007 .
even if a budget is adopted , there is no lack of depressing business for the Austrian presidency , which starts on January 1 . the deepest problem is Europe ’ s inability to grow at more than a snail ’ s pace and to provide jobs to its citizens .
the collective response , adopted in 2000 , has been the “ Lisbon Strategy , ” which aims at making the EU “ the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world ” by 2010 . more realistically , it is designed to provide governments with the incentive to undertake the reforms that stimulate economic growth and productivity .
that means facing down the myriad interest groups – from industry lobbies to trade unions and entrenched bureaucracies – that have ( so far ) successfully protected their turfs . the strategy rests on peer pressure , naming and shaming governments that fail to make progress .
the best that they could do now would be to dump the pretense of a strategy and carry on with the other business . unfortunately , the host of the 2000 summit was José Manuel Barroso , then Prime Minister of Portugal and current President of the European Commission , who has staked his presidency on the Lisbon Strategy .
intra-European competition in services is restricted by innumerable national regulations that , for instance , strictly determine the requirements for becoming a hairdresser or a plumber . one of the defining features of the past decades is the sharp increase in services productivity in the US ; none of that happened in Europe .
not surprisingly , the proposal was quickly shelved . now , with countless private interest groups trying to water it down into irrelevance , the battle will be firmly on the EU ’ s agenda in 2006 .
at the same time , Europe is again blocking progress in the Doha round of world trade talks , with the farmers ’ lobby fighting to preserve its subsidies . many governments are so fearful of their farmers that they see no other option than to hold their ground , no matter what .
and what next for the ECB , which has just nudged up interest rates by 0.25 % , after 30 months on hold . experts can disagree about whether the move was premature , but no one agrees with the many political leaders who have argued that the tiny hike will derail the timid resumption of economic growth .
while such a move is out of the question – it would require a change in the European Treaty – the noise is unhealthy . it distracts the ECB , adds to the impression that Europe is bad , and , more importantly , will be used by ineffective governments as a scapegoat for their failings .
the current team of leaders has been an enormous disappointment . but as they fade away , there could be some light at the end of the tunnel .
in France , President Jacques Chirac , the epitome of a leader captured by his lobbies , is staggering impotently toward the end of his term in 2007 . the two frontrunners to succeed him , Dominique de Villepin and Nicolas Sarkozy , both in government , compete on a reformist agenda , but pre-election years do not encourage bold moves .
meanwhile , Italy must decide whether it replaces Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , who displayed no interest in reform and European affairs , with the cautious Romano Prodi , the former European Commission President . Tony Blair , once an ardent pro-European ( at least by Britain ’ s undemanding standards ) , might finally have to cede power to Gordon Brown , who is famously cold to European integration .
what Next in Afghanistan ?
the Taliban are gaining military and political strength , and President Hamid Karzai is losing support at home and internationally due to his administration ’ s rampant corruption and the obvious fraud committed in his re-election . weariness with the war is spreading in the United States , where President Barack Obama finds it difficult to decide about an increase in troops , as demanded by his own generals .
the West seems to have lost its orientation in the Hindu Kush – that “ graveyard of empires , ” as it was called after the British disaster in January 1842 , when only one man survived an expedition 16,000 . what , many people are asking , is NATO really fighting for in Afghanistan ?
in the US , the debate about the purposes being served in Afghanistan is at least still taking place . follow it , and you will conclude that , ultimately , the war is all about the American superpower ’ s military victory over the Taliban , so that it can finally withdraw its troops – for a second time .
the source or meaning of the conflict in Afghanistan is impossible to find in the country itself . Afghanistan is the battlefield , but the causes of the wars that have devastated it since the mid-1970 ’ s were and are still to be found beyond its borders .
three dates are central to understanding today ’ s Afghan quagmire : 1989 , 2001 , and 2003 .
in 1989 , when the Cold War ended , the Red Army had already withdrawn from the country , thereby admitting its defeat . following the Soviet Union , the US withdrew from the conflict , too , and at that moment , the second Afghan war started – a proxy war between regional neighbors over power in the Hindu Kush , disguised as a civil war .
Iran defended its own interests and those of the Shia minority in the west of the country . and in the north , the Tajik Northern Alliance and Abdul Rashid Dostum ’ s Uzbek militia were supported and equipped by Afghanistan ’ s northern neighbors and Russia .
in the shadow of this second Afghan war , Osama bin Laden established his terrorist organization in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan : Al Qaeda , which , on September 11 , 2001 , carried out its terrible terrorist attack on the US . a month later , the current war in Afghanistan started .
in March 2003 , George W. Bush launched his invasion of Iraq , not only squandering America ’ s military strength , but also connecting all the individual crises between the eastern Mediterranean and the Indus Valley . as a result of America ’ s foreign-policy folly , Iran became the central geo-political player in the entire region , linking the western and eastern part of this long belt of instability .
so , those who are grappling with the Afghan riddle today should consider , first and foremost , the regional realities : can the West afford to withdraw ? if so , we should pull out of Afghanistan immediately .
it is extremely doubtful that such a step would bring more security . on the other hand , the West ’ s strategy in Afghanistan up to now has also yielded little progress , only strengthening the Taliban day by day .
first , we need to define a clear political goal : a stable status quo in Afghanistan that will prevent the country from again becoming a battlefield of regional interests and an organizational base for Al Qaeda . without a sufficient military presence , as well as improved and reinforced reconstruction efforts , this goal is not attainable .
this requires that Pakistan ’ s and Iran ’ s interests be included in this consensus , as well as India ’ s , Saudi Arabia ’ s and probably also China ’ s . ( the Kashmir conflict must , indirectly , play a role in this settlement , but the difficulties of including it should not be underestimated . )
third , a parallel effort at crisis containment – and perhaps even at finding solutions – is needed for the wider Middle East , Iraq , the Persian Gulf , and Iran . it ’ s an equation with very many known unknowns , but if we do not try at least to mitigate these issues , the known unknowns will continue challenging all partial solutions .
but the big question remains whether the US and its European allies still have the strength , perseverance and far-sightedness for such an undertaking . there are good reasons to doubt this .
what Now In the Middle East ?
the political and security situation in the vast region between the Indus Valley and the shores of the Eastern Mediterranean is a cause for grave concern . when the US intervened militarily in Iraq in 1991 , the intention was to effect fundamental change in the entire region .
the existing power relations in the Middle East have indeed been permanently shaken and , indeed , revolutionized . the effect however , has not been a domino-like democratization ; instead we are threatened with a domino effect of descent into chaos .
the decision to go to war against Iraq to liberate Kuwait , back in 1991 , marked the beginning of America ’ s role as the sole hegemonic military power in the region . the decision to go to war against Iraq for a second time , and then to occupy the country in March 2003 , transformed this hegemony into direct US responsibility for the future of the Middle East .
were the US to succeed in using its military strength , it would create a new , democratic Middle East . but were it , despite its military might , to fail , it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region .
the very character of the war in Iraq has been transformed from a democratizing mission into a stabilizing mission high in casualties and in cost . instead of the intended radical realignment of power relations in the region , the aim is now to simply maintain the status quo .
the recent elections in America were a referendum on the war in Iraq . their result in fact set a timetable for the “ Iraqisation ” and US withdrawal – before the next presidential election .
behind the all-too-foreseeable end of the American stabilizing mission lurks a civil war in Iraq , which threatens to turn into an Arab-Iranian proxy war for dominance in Iraq , the Gulf , Lebanon , the Palestinian territories , and beyond . moreover , there is an acute risk that the power vacuum created in Iraq will fuse the Israeli-Arab conflict , Iraq , and Afghanistan into one regional mega-crisis .
in light of America ’ s impending withdrawal , the regional powers are reassessing their interests and objectives . Iran , Syria , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Jordan , Pakistan , Turkey , and Israel will be the main players .
so at stake is no longer just Iraq , but rather the future of the entire region . we can count ourselves lucky if the emerging chaos can be contained in Iraq .
Washington ’ s realization that Iraq can no longer be won or even stabilized unless the regional framework changes , has come late – perhaps too late . the US will have to find agreement with its allies and enter into direct talks with all the other players to try and achieve a new regional consensus .
if this policy shift had taken place a year ago or even early last summer , the prospects would have been better . and with every passing day , America ’ s position in the region is weakening further and the chances of a successful new political strategy become more remote .
the greatest danger stems from Iran , the clear beneficiary of the Iraqi power vacuum . Iran harbors hegemonic ambitions which it seeks to realize by means of its military potential , oil and gas reserves , its nuclear program , its influence over Shiites throughout the region , and its efforts to upset the status quo within the Arab Muslim world .
its only allies in the region are Syria and Hezbollah . what ’ s more , it is threatened by a de-facto anti-Iranian coalition of all other regional powers , united by their fear of Iranian ascendancy .
in their stead must come , on the one hand , direct talks , security guarantees , and support in political and economic integration . to be successful , this strategy also requires a realistic threat of isolation of those who continue to undermine regional stability , as well as substantial progress in the Arab-Israeli conflict .
a new Middle East policy will thus have to concentrate primarily on four aspects : 1 ) a comprehensive offer to Syria to detach the country from Iran and settle open conflicts ; 2 ) an offer to Iran for direct talks about the perspective of a full normalization of relations ; 3 ) a decisive and realistic initiative to resolve the Israeli-Arab conflict 4 ) a regional security architecture that centers on stabilizing Iraq and Afghanistan .
what Now ? more Europe !
the naysayers ’ victories show that sovereignty-based arguments that oppose any kind of European political union are on the march . Euroskeptics , it seems , are gaining ground everywhere , and a kind of xenophobia is on the rise .
but xenophobia and sovereignty were not the primary impulses that propelled the “ no ” votes . above all , the “ no ” votes in France and Holland – and rising discontent in other member states , such as Germany – are the result of the inability of national governments and the Union to respond effectively to the problems that most concern citizens .
many Europeans are , in fact , calling on the EU to act to reduce unemployment and to intervene decisively in the international arena . many interpreted Europe ’ s internal division over the war in Iraq , with ordinary citizens overwhelmingly opposed to military intervention , as a sign of the Union ’ s weakness .
but the answer to such doubt and dismay is more Europe , not less . the European Council ’ s summit on June 16-17 should give a clear sign that it recognizes this .
they are right . it would be imprudent to assume that the French and Dutch “ no ” votes were not about discontent with Union policies ; but that anger was directed against the French and Dutch governments , not Europe itself .
the fact is that citizens in every EU member country are increasingly aware that national policies are determined by decision making at the European level , over which they have little influence . the European Constitution has little to do with this , but referenda are never confined to the actual questions put to voters .
the 2004 elections for the European Parliament had already shown that the level of discontent with the Union was high . voters heavily punished almost all national governments .
above all , the French and Dutch referendums confirmed that politics in the Union is now conducted “ on the street , ” and that it is no longer possible to “ construct ” Europe at a distance and by stealth . this means that EU governments must respond to popular anxieties and make the Union more transparent and democratic .
this would be a lot easier with the Constitution in place , but there are measures that can and should be adopted now to make that possible . first , the community budget should be structured so that it has a significant impact on growth and employment ( a return to the voluntarism of the Delors Packages , now applied to the Lisbon Strategy ) .
second , European governments must show a real commitment to act together . a key opportunity presents itself with the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Declaration to define a common position to support democratic change in the Mediterranean by ceasing to back the political status quo there .
finally , Council meetings should be open when legislative matters are at stake , so that citizens can know who voted for what and according to which criteria .
all of this can be decided at the next European Council , even before the constitutional problem is resolved . this kind of action is more likely to win back a skeptical citizenry than any information campaign , however well designed .
at the same time , it is necessary to solve the Constitutional deadlock . as already proposed by the Convention , this would mean separating constitutional matters per se from Union policy .
it is essential to reaffirm the normative essence of the Constitutional Treaty to protect the greatest achievement of the Constitutional Convention . diversity and inclusiveness , through the integration of European democracies with a common project , remains Europe ’ s great gift to the world .
such a Europe is better placed to contribute to a fairer international order than the narrow , bitter Europe the xenophobes have in mind . for Europe to remain a promise for the world , it must thrive as a public good for all its citizens .
what Nuclear Energy Renaissance ?
Zurich – Repeatedly in recent years there have been calls for a revival of civilian nuclear power . yet that renaissance never seems to come .
indeed , of the more than 200 countries in the world , only 30 use nuclear power . in July 2010 , a total of 439 nuclear power plants with a net installed capacity of 373.038 GW ( e ) were connected to various national electricity grids , about 1.2 GW ( e ) more than at the beginning of 2006 .
nuclear fission ’ s contribution to total electric energy has decreased from about 18 % more than ten years ago to about 14 % in 2008 . on a worldwide scale , nuclear energy is thus only a small component of the global energy mix , and its share , contrary to widespread belief , is not on the rise .
but this assumes that all of them are constructed according to schedule , and the nuclear industry has rarely met its promised construction deadlines . according to the World Nuclear Association ( WNA ) , 17 new reactors should have become operational between 2007 and 2009 .
moreover , four reactors were de-commissioned during 2009 , and a larger number of reactors in Japan and Germany are not in use , owing to various technical stoppages . at least one hundred older and smaller reactors will most likely be closed over the next 10-15 years .
furthermore , during the past 10 years , only about two-thirds of worldwide demand for nuclear fuel – about 68,000 tons of natural uranium equivalent are needed for 2010 – was met from resources obtained from mining . the remaining 20,000 tons came from so-called secondary uranium sources – mainly inventories held by utilities and governments , re-processed nuclear fuel , and stockpiles of depleted uranium .
current projections indicate that uranium shortages in the coming years can be avoided only if existing and new uranium mines operate according to plan . indeed , extrapolations of global supply that foresee an increase in uranium mining are based on claims about the ability to expand output in Kazakhstan .
but it remains to be seen if the uranium mining in this country can indeed increase further to 18,000 tons in 2010 and to 30,000 tons by 2018 . according to the WNA ’ s latest estimates , from July 2010 , the expected uranium extraction figure for 2010 has actually been decreased to 15,000 tons .
these numbers indicate that the EU , currently producing about 1 / 3 of the world ’ s nuclear electric energy , is heading for a reduction in nuclear-energy production of up to 20 % over the coming 10 years . one can also expect that the current worldwide economic crisis will not help to accelerate the construction of nuclear power plants and new uranium mines .
in summary , the hard facts about nuclear energy are inconsistent with the possibility of a worldwide renaissance of nuclear energy . indeed , they point toward a continuing slow phase-out of civilian nuclear energy in most of the large OECD countries .
it thus seems unavoidable that energy consumers , especially in many rich countries , will have to learn to exchange their current worries about the distant future consequences of global warming for the reality of energy shortages during periods of peak demand . such shortages could result either in chaotic supplies and power outages or in a coordinated policy of energy rationing .
in the absence of nuclear-energy revival , most of us will be forced to reduce our direct energy consumption . let us hope that we can learn to adapt to simpler – though perhaps still satisfying – lifestyles .
what Reset Button ?
Moscow – The emergence of a Kremlin leader , President Dmitri Medvedev , without a KGB background , combined with the economic crisis , has inspired talk that when Barack Obama visits Moscow , America ’ s president will be seeing a country on the verge of a new political thaw , a revived perestroika . but pushing the “ re-set button ” on US-Russia relations may be harder than Obama and his team imagined .
Russian ( or Soviet ) leaders opt for perestroika or a thaw only when forced to do so by dire conditions that threaten the regime ’ s survival . an atmosphere of mortal fear , mutual suspicion , and hatred among the Communist elite was the catalyst for Nikita Khrushchev ’ s post-Stalin thaw .
for both men , the goal of clinging to power was a top priority . changing the system and easing their grip on power was a risky move that could undermine their authority .
as he revived centralized Kremlin control over Russian politics and public affairs , Vladimir Putin has been concerned primarily with minimizing challenges to state power , which he concentrated in his own hands . to this end , he stripped the political system of competition , emasculated state institutions , marginalized the opposition , and basically eliminated public participation .
with policymaking fully nontransparent and reduced to a very closed circle , and implementation delegated to an unaccountable bureaucracy , the inevitable result of Putin ’ s political model was pervasive corruption . the desire to avoid public discontent and ensure social stability led to a suspension of reform .
instead of creating incentives that would unleash public energies , the government pushed citizens farther and farther from politics and policymaking , thereby deepening social apathy and atomization . moreover , the opportunity provided by the oil boom was wasted .
when oil prices were high and growing , the government could compensate for poor performance by throwing money at problems . today , with oil prices dramatically reduced , this largesse is no longer available , and economic experts agree that the growth potential of Russia ’ s petro-economy has been exhausted .
nor does the Russian economy ’ s contraction and the expected deepening of poverty ( the World Bank ’ s report released in late June was grimmer about Russia than its previous report ) presage an immediate catastrophe . and , unlike in the late 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , Russia is not indebted to foreign banks or international organizations , though it plans to resume foreign borrowing next year .
so the government will prefer to muddle through the crisis , rather than risk any decisive reform . the goal of clinging to power remains the priority , and risk-aversion the main guideline .
just recently , two of Putin ’ s deputies gave interviews to two Western media outlets offering what sounded like starkly opposite visions for Russia ’ s development . but such disputes never spill over into the broad public sphere ; members of the elite are primarily concerned about social and political stability and would not stir the public by seeking support for an alternative policy course .
Russians may be concerned by growing unemployment and reduced incomes , but this is not manifesting itself in any drive to organize or try to effect political change . the public below , just like the leaders above , cherish political stability ; the popularity ratings of both Prime Minister Putin and President Dmitri Medvedev remain above 70 % .
Disgruntlement over the increasingly authoritarian governance may be common among business circles , elements of the neutered political opposition , liberal intellectuals , and even part of the bureaucracy . but these forces are too timid and fragmented , with no drive for political action .
the current government ’ s tactic of muddling through without changing the political system or the structure of the economy is fraught with the risk of gradual decline . to the Kremlin ’ s rulers , this may seem an acceptable cost for retaining power , but postponing reform will only aggravate Russia ’ s countless problems .
a dramatic curtailment of state resources may eventually push the government toward modernization , but it might also produce an uglier shift — toward harder political crackdown , economic nationalism and an essentially isolationist course . this would be catastrophic for Russia — to say nothing of relations with the US .
what Role for the State ?
Washington , DC – The financial crisis of 2008 has spurred a global debate on how much government regulation of markets – and what kind – is appropriate . in the United States , it is a key theme in the upcoming presidential election , and it is shaping politics in Europe and emerging markets as well .
for starters , China ’ s impressive growth performance over the last three decades has given the world an economically successful example of what many call “ state capitalism . ” Brazil ’ s development policies have also accorded a strong role to the state .
many critics of Europe , particularly in the US , link the euro crisis to the outsize role of government there , though the Scandinavian countries are doing well , despite high public spending . in France , the new center-left government faces the challenge of delivering on its promise of strengthening social solidarity while substantially reducing the budget deficit .
alongside the mostly economic arguments about the role of government , many countries are experiencing widespread disillusionment with politics and a growing distance between citizens and government ( particularly national government ) . in many countries , participation rates in national elections are falling , and new parties and movements , such as the Pirate Party in Germany and the Five Star Movement in Italy , reflect strong discontent with existing governance .
in the US , the approval rating of Congress is at a record-low of 14 % . many there , such as my colleague Bruce Katz at the Brookings Institution , believe that the only solution is to bring a larger share of governance and policy initiation to the state and municipal level , in close partnership with the private sector and civil society .
but that approach , too , might have a downside . consider Spain , where too much fiscal decentralization to regional governments contributed significantly to weakening otherwise strong public finances .
a crucial problem for this global debate is that , despite the realities of twenty-first-century technology and globalization , it is still conducted largely as if governance and public policy were almost exclusively the domain of the nation-state . to adapt the debate to the real challenges that we face , we should focus on four levels of governance and identify the most appropriate allocation of public-policy functions to them .
first , many policies – including support for local infrastructure , land zoning , facilitation of industrial production and training , traffic ordinances , and environmental regulations – can largely be determined at the local or metropolitan level and reflect the wishes of a local electorate .
most nation-states maintain national currencies , and must therefore pursue fiscal and economic policies that support a monetary union . as the eurozone crisis has starkly reminded us , decentralization cannot extend too far into the budgetary sphere , lest it threaten the common currency ’ s survival .
the US system is manageable , because the American states are largely constrained to running balanced budgets , while the federal government accounts for most fiscal policy . moreover , banking regulation and deposit insurance are centralized in the US , as they must be in a monetary union .
so , governance at the nation-state level remains hugely important and is intimately linked to monetary sovereignty . the key problem in Europe today is whether eurozone members will advance towards something resembling a federal nation-state .
finally , there is the global level . the spread of infectious disease , global trade and finance , climate change , nuclear non-proliferation , counterterrorism , and cyber security are just some of the issues that require broad international cooperation and global governance .
that is a huge challenge for political leadership and communication , but , if it is not met , democracy and globalization will be difficult to reconcile . how to conduct democratic debate with reference to these local , national , continental , and global levels , and to structure a political space that better reflects economic and social space , will be the great challenge of the decades ahead .
what Should Bretton Woods II Look Like ?
new YORK – For those of us who have long claimed that the world ’ s international financial architecture needed deep reform , the call for a “ Bretton Woods II ” is welcome . of course , similar calls were made after the Asian and Russian crises of 1997-1998 , but were not taken seriously by the rich industrial countries .
it is obviously good for the G-7 or a subset of G-7 members to show leadership , but no fundamental reform can occur without an inclusive process that gives both industrial and developing countries , and both large and small countries an adequate voice . global institutions , not ad hoc groups of countries , must be at the center of the reform effort .
discussion must start by agreeing on regulatory principles . an obvious one is that regulations must be comprehensive , to avoid the massive loopholes that led to the current turmoil .
regulations should also have a strong counter-cyclical focus , preventing excessive accumulation of leverage and increasing capital and provisions ( reserves ) during booms , as well as preventing asset price bubbles from feeding into credit expansion . reliance on financial institutions ’ internal models , the major focus of the Basel II agreement on banking regulation , should be discarded .
most agree that the International Monetary Fund should not be at the center of the regulatory system . the Bank for International Settlements and the Basel Committee are better placed , but a fundamental reform is needed to broaden their membership and to avoid a major problem of the Basel Committee : its lack of representation of developing countries .
this would overcome both the inequities and the instability that is inherent in a global reserve system based on a national currency . today ’ s system is plagued by cycles of confidence in the dollar and by periodic shocks due to American policies that are adopted independently of their global impact and thus imposed on the rest of the world .
this is the only way to give developing countries a voice . the multilateral surveillance on global imbalances that the Fund launched in 2006 was an interesting step in this direction , but it has lacked commitment by the parties , as well as teeth .
in all these areas , the IMF should make more active use of regional institutions . for a decade , I have proposed that the IMF of the future should be seen as the apex of a network of regional reserve funds – that is , a system closer in design to the European Central Bank or the United States Federal Reserve system .
a similar institutional design could be adopted for prudential policies . a denser network of institutions seems better adapted to a heterogeneous international community , and it is likely to provide better services and give a stronger voice to smaller countries .
finally , one major deficiency of the current international financial architecture is the lack of an institutional framework – i.e. , a court similar to those created to manage bankruptcies in national economies – to manage debt overhangs at the international level . the current system relies on ad hoc mechanisms , which generally operate too late , after high indebtedness has already imposed devastating effects .
but any summons to a “ Bretton Woods II ” conference must be concrete in its content . a global system for prudential regulation and supervision ; a revamped IMF managing a global reserve currency , coordinating global macroeconomic policy , and providing agile credit lines ; and an international debt court – all of these must be on the agenda .
what ’ s Left of Confucianism ?
Beijing – The Chinese government ’ s very public display of compassion and transparency in response to the devastating earthquake in Sichuan province appears to have strengthened its authority and its bonds with ordinary Chinese people . the government and army worked hand in hand with legions of volunteers and private networks to rescue quake victims .
but heroic rescue efforts will not be able to help the government forever , so it is worth asking what can provide long-term political legitimacy . after all , communism has lost its capacity to inspire the Chinese .
most Westerners think the answer is liberal democracy , as did many Chinese liberals in the twentieth century . but there is another answer , which takes the form of the old and venerable tradition of Confucianism , which is being revived by government officials , critical intellectuals , and ordinary citizens .
the opening ceremony of the Olympic games will highlight this revival : it will feature not quotes from Marx , but sayings from the Analects of Confucius . such sayings as “ The world ’ s peoples are all brothers ” and “ Isn ’ t one of life ’ s greatest pleasures to have friends visiting from afar ? ” will be beamed to billions worldwide , expressing the best that Chinese culture has to offer .
Confucianism has been combined with Legalism , China ’ s other main political tradition , to justify such practices as blind obedience to the ruler , subordination of women , and the use of harsh punishments . the “ official ” Confucianism being revived today may be less dangerous – it emphasizes social harmony , meaning the peaceful resolution of conflicts – but it remains a conservative morality .
it leaves open basic metaphysical commitments and takes a plural and tolerant view of religious life . it emphasizes equality of opportunity in education as well as meritocracy in government , with leadership positions being distributed to the community ’ s most virtuous and qualified members .
such values owe their origin to the “ original Confucianism ” of Confucius , Mencius , and Xunzi , which existed before Confucianism became established as state orthodoxy . in imperial times , the critical tradition was carried forward by such scholars as Huang Zongxi .
Confucian scholars such as Jiang Qing openly acknowledge that their interpretation of Confucianism most closely parallels socialist ideals : not the “ actually existing socialism ” in today ’ s China , but the socialist ideals defended by Karl Marx and others . this Confucian tradition aims to influence contemporary politics , but it also remains separate from state power and orthodoxy , always ready to point to the gap between ideals and reality .
indeed , left Confucianism ’ s departure from the status quo is precisely the point : it is meant to provide a moral standard for social critics and to inspire visions of a more desirable political future . unlike communism , it offers a future that derives its legitimacy from tradition and building upon what the past has to offer – including the socialist tradition – rather than destroying it .
thus , left Confucians favor institutional reform , arguing that the long-term stability and legitimacy of political institutions requires that they be founded on Chinese traditions .
such concrete proposals for political reform inspired by Confucian values can rarely be published in mainland China . in fact , there are fewer constraints imposed on public discussion of liberal-democratic institutions precisely because few Chinese are inspired by Western-style liberal democracy .
what ’ s Stopping Women ?
I also expected to hear from business representatives about whether my proposed solutions – greater workplace flexibility , ending the culture of face-time and “ time machismo , ” and allowing parents who have been out of the workforce or working part-time to compete equally for top jobs once they re-enter – were feasible or utopian .
indeed , in many ways , the article is a litmus test of where individual countries are in their own evolution toward full equality for men and women . India and Britain , for example , have had strong women prime ministers in Indira Gandhi and Margaret Thatcher , but now must grapple with the “ woman-as-man ” archetype of female success .
the Scandinavian countries know that women around the world look to them as pioneers of social and economic policies that enable women to be mothers and successful career professionals , and that encourage and expect men to play an equal parenting role . but they are not producing as many women managers in the private sector as the United States is , much less at the top ranks .
one major German magazine decided to frame my contribution to the debate as “ career woman admits that it ’ s better to be home . ” Another ( more accurately ) highlighted my emphasis on the need for deep social and economic change to allow women to have equal choices .
beyond Europe , Japanese women lament how far they must still go in a relentlessly male and sexist culture . the Chinese now have a generation of educated , empowered young women who are not sure whether they want to marry at all , owing to the constraints that a husband ( and a mother-in-law ) would place on their freedom .
Brazilian women point with pride to their president , Dilma Rousseff , but also underscore how much discrimination remains . in Australia , with its robust work-life debate , women point to the success of Julia Gillard , the first woman prime minister , but note that she has no children ( nor does German Chancellor Angela Merkel , the first woman to lead her country ) .
the global nature of this debate demonstrates at least three important lessons . first , if “ soft power ” means exercising influence because “ others want what you want , ” as Joseph Nye puts it , then women the world over want what American feminists began fighting for three generations ago .
after all , women have ascended the political ladder faster in many other countries than they have in the US . indeed , the US has never had a woman president , Senate majority leader , Secretary of the Treasury , or Secretary of Defense .
finally , these are not “ women ’ s issues , ” but social and economic issues . societies that discover how to use the education and talent of half their populations , while allowing women and their partners to invest in their families , will have a competitive edge in the global knowledge / innovation economy .
those are just the most extreme cases of physical violence that many women face . worldwide , more than a billion women confront grinding and overt gender discrimination in education , nutrition , health care , and salaries .
still , consider a recent matter-of-fact report from a sober and respected US magazine . in an article on “ Women in Washington , ” the National Journal observed that women in the US capital have come a long way , but “ still face career barriers , and often the biggest one is having a family . ”
if “ having a family ” is still a career barrier for women , but not for men , that , too , is a matter of women ’ s rights ( and thus of human rights ) . in the global debate about work , family , and the promise of gender equality , no society is exempt .
what ’ s the Beef in South Korea ?
new YORK – At the outset of the ongoing violent protests in South Korea over imported beef from the United States , the entire cabinet of South Korean President Lee Myung-bak offered to resign . last week , President Lee fired three of them . but beef , it turns out , represents just the tip of the iceberg of grievances against President Lee .
Lee won the December 2007 election with 48.7 % of the vote , having run on the “ 747 ” platform , promising 7 % annual GDP growth , per capita income of $ 40,000 , and to make Korea the world ’ s seventh largest economy ( up from 13th currently ) . during his inauguration speech , he vowed to revive the economy , strengthen relations with the US , and deal with North Korea .
so what went wrong ?
the economy is slowing – the Bank of Korea cut its growth forecast for this year to 4.7 % , while the OECD expects only 4.3 % growth – inflation is rising , and some are concerned that Lee ’ s policies are too geared toward foreign investors and big business . Lee also must confront factors beyond his control , such as soaring oil prices and the global credit crunch .
beyond the economy , Lee has been faced with charges of appointing officials with questionable ethics and of heavy-handed leadership ( his nickname is “ Bulldozer ” ) , which is reflected in efforts to push through a controversial cross-country canal system and an unpopular proposal to privatize the healthcare system . furthermore , Lee ’ s hard-line approach to North Korea – very different from that of his predecessors – has resulted in a popular backlash .
on the eve of the visit , his government agreed to lift the five-year-old ban on US beef imports as part of efforts to improve bilateral ties following years of up-and-down relations during former President Roh Moo-hyun ’ s administration . while most in the West applauded Lee ’ s visit , the reaction in Korea was significantly more negative .
many in Korea viewed the beef decision as having been hastily taken , and without appropriate consultation of all relevant parties . in addition , significant segments of the population saw the agreement as Lee selling out or kowtowing to the Americans .
Lee seems to have misjudged the strength of his election victory and the currents of opinion in several important ways . given the nationalist sentiments motivating the beef protesters , the strength of opposition forces , and widespread hostility to opening and privatizing the South Korean economy further , Lee , whose authoritarian style of management reminds many of the era of military rule , will now need to move forward carefully .
Lee must reach out to the opposition , both within his party and outside it , to build agreement or negotiate compromise on the contentious issues that his administration faces . he must reach out to the people of Korea and demonstrate that he is willing to listen to their concerns and act accordingly .
the upside of all this political turmoil is that it demonstrates the vigor of Korean democracy . Lee ’ s task now is to discover how best to take advantage of this new political activism .
what ’ s Wrong with Ethnic Profiling ?
this police officer was describing a textbook example of “ ethnic profiling ” : law enforcement officials use of stereotypes , rather than specific information about behavior , in deciding to stop , search , or detain people . ethnic profiling is illegal in Europe .
the inefficiency of ethnic profiling was highlighted in early May , when the British government released figures showing that , of the more than 117,000 police stops made between 2007 and 2008 , only 72 led to an arrest for terrorism-related offences . other major European countries do not collect data on police stops broken down according to the targets ’ ethnic or religious background .
a massive data-mining exercise in Germany from 2001 to 2003 trawled through personal information on 8.3 million people and failed to find a single terrorist . stops and searches conducted under counter-terrorism powers in Europe have produced few terrorism charges and no convictions .
as a new report by the Open Society Justice Initiative shows , by targeting ethnic minorities , police alienate some of the very people on whom they depend for cooperation and intelligence . and by pre-selecting fixed categories of people for heightened scrutiny , the authorities overlook those who do not fit the profile .
a young Spanish man who is a member of an ethnic minority group put it this way : “ I worry when I go on the street that the police will stop me and ask me for my papers because of the color of my skin , by my tone of skin , by my way of walking . ”
when the police use ethnic profiling , they project an image of being tough on crime and terrorism . this appeases public opinion , which demands robust anti-terrorism action .
following the September 2001 attacks in New York , and again after the bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005 , law-enforcement authorities across Europe launched mass-arrest operations , undertook widespread surveillance of mosques , carried out stops and searches of people who appeared to be Muslim , and used other intrusive measures that disrupted the lives of – and in many cases humiliated – law-abiding European citizens .
as public anxiety has abated , and senior officials have felt less pressure to show that they are doing something , the most flagrant abuses have declined . but such practices are still being applied to a lesser degree , and they can be pulled out of the arsenal whenever political or social conditions dictate .
in late April , the European Parliament issued a report highlighting the danger that unrestricted data mining that relies on racial , ethnic , or national origin would subject innocent people to arbitrary stops , travel restrictions , and bans on employment or banking . the report called for legislation to protect against ethnic profiling .
the solution is not to ignore the threat of terrorism , but to address the threat more intelligently . over the past two years , a project that our organization undertook with police forces and civil-society groups in Hungary and Spain found that , when stops were systematically monitored and data publicly reported , the proportion of stops that produced an arrest or other law-enforcement outcome actually increased .
this makes sense . when officers are required to articulate grounds for suspicion , they are more likely to rely on behavioral factors rather than prejudice .
in the future , the European Union and its member states should fund more collaboration between police and minority communities . the EU should combat radicalization by addressing exclusion , not by conflating conservative religious faith with terrorism .
by treating people as suspicious purely because of who they are , how they look , or where they pray , rather than what they do or have done , ethnic profiling threatens the very ethos of the EU , a union firmly rooted in values of liberty , democracy , and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
what ’ s Wrong with Transformational Leadership ?
Cambridge – This year ’ s presidential campaign in the United States has been marked by calls from Barack Obama ’ s would-be Republican challengers for a radical transformation of American foreign policy . campaigns are always more extreme than the eventual reality , but countries should be wary of calls for transformational change .
in 2001 , George W. Bush started his first term with little interest in foreign policy , but adopted transformational objectives after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . like Woodrow Wilson , Franklin Roosevelt , and Harry Truman before him , Bush turned to the rhetoric of democracy to rally his followers in a time of crisis .
Bush cannot be blamed for the intelligence failures that attributed such weapons to Saddam , given that many other countries shared such estimates . but inadequate understanding of the Iraqi and regional context , together with poor planning and management , undercut Bush ’ s transformational objectives .
then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice praised the virtues of “ transformational diplomacy . ” But , while leadership theorists and editorial writers tend to think that transformational foreign-policy officials are better in either ethics or effectiveness , the evidence does not support this view .
consider President George H.W. Bush , who did not do “ the vision thing , ” but whose sound management and execution underpinned one of the most successful US foreign-policy agendas of the past half-century . perhaps genetic engineers will one day be able to produce leaders equally endowed with both vision and management skills ; comparing the two Bushes ( who shared half their genes ) , it is clear that nature has not yet solved the problem .
Franklin Roosevelt and Truman made crucial contributions . but , in judging leaders , we need to pay attention to acts of both omission and commission , to what happened and to what was avoided , to the dogs that barked and to those that did not .
we live in a world of diverse cultures , and we know very little about social engineering and how to “ build nations . ” When we cannot be sure how to improve the world , prudence becomes an important virtue , and grandiose visions can pose grave dangers .
for these reasons , the virtues of transactional leaders with good contextual intelligence are very important . someone like George H. W. Bush , unable to articulate a vision but able to steer successfully through crises , turns out to be a better leader than someone like his son , possessed of a powerful vision but with little contextual intelligence or management skill .
former Secretary of State George Shultz , who served under Ronald Reagan , once compared his role to gardening – “ the constant nurturing of a complex array of actors , interests , and goals . ” But Shultz ’ s Stanford colleague , Condoleezza Rice , wanted a more transformational diplomacy that did not accept the world as it was , but tried to change it .
America is not in absolute decline , and , in relative terms , there is a reasonable probability that it will remain more powerful than any other country in the coming decades . we do not live in a “ post-American world , ” but we also do not live in the American era of the late twentieth century .
it will also confront a growing number of issues that require power with others as much as power over others in order to obtain the country ’ s preferred outcomes . America ’ s capacity to maintain alliances and create cooperative networks will be an important dimension of its hard and soft power .
the problem of America ’ s role in the twenty-first century is not one of ( poorly specified ) “ decline , ” but rather of developing the contextual intelligence to understand that even the largest country cannot achieve what it wants without others ’ help . educating the public to understand this complex globalized information age , and what is required to operate successfully in it , will be the real transformational leadership task .
what ’ s Wrong With Turkey ?
on December 16 , Orhan Pamuk , one of Turkey ’ s most famous writers , will enter an Istanbul court to face a charge of “ insulting the national identity ” after he advocated open discussion of the Turkish genocide of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916 . Pamuk faces three years in prison .
in December 1999 , the European Council granted Turkey the status of EU candidate-member , implying that Turkey would accede to the Union at some future , unspecified date . the Council subsequently asked the European Commission to decide by October 2004 whether Turkey had sufficiently fulfilled the political criteria – including democracy , the rule of law , and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities – for membership .
this report mentioned that in 2003 some 21,870 Turks submitted asylum claims in the EU , of which 2,127 were accepted . in other words , the EU ’ s own governments acknowledged in 2003 that the Turkish government had persecuted more than 2,000 of its own citizens .
in March 2005 , the police violently disrupted a demonstration to celebrate International Women ’ s Day . in May , the largest teachers ’ union was banned for promoting the education of Turkey ’ s 14 million Kurds in their own language .
indeed , intolerance goes right to the top of the Turkish government . foreign Minister Abdullah Gül abruptly cancelled a recent press conference in Copenhagen when he spied a Kurdish journalist in the audience and the Danes refused to evict him .
Christianity , feudalism , the Renaissance , the Enlightenment , democracy , and industrialization have made us what we Europeans are , but they have not made Turks who they are . so I am not convinced that reforms in Turkey implemented at the insistence of the European Commission would continue after accession .
moreover , Turkey ’ s accession would lead inevitably to that of Ukraine , Belarus , and Moldova , and perhaps of Georgia , Armenia , and Azerbaïdjan . the first three of these countries are certainly more European than Turkey .
the Commission , as the guardian of the Union ’ s treaties , must protect these four fundamental freedoms , which means that it must sometimes persuade , and if necessary force , member states to change their laws . alcohol policy in Sweden , the Volkswagen-law in Germany , and discrimination against foreign investment funds in France are examples of cases that made the Commission unpopular .
by the time I left the Commission , I was sitting on a pile of 1,500 such infringement proceedings . in short , EU membership entails having to accept incisive measures that deeply affect a state ’ s internal affairs .
the EU would become unacceptably diluted . that is why former French President Valéry Giscard d ’ Estaing feared that Turkey ’ s entry would lead to the EU ’ s breakup , and it is why former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said , “ Accession of Turkey would be more than the EU could bear . ”
but the strongest reason to oppose Turkey ’ s accession is a question of democracy : a majority of the EU ’ s population simply does not want it .
what Syria Means
new DELHI – Syria ’ s agony has generated a variety of unproductive responses : verbal condemnation of the excesses of President Bashar al-Assad ’ s regime ; disagreements about the wisdom of armed intervention ; and all-around confusion about the possibility of finding a viable long-term solution . worse , in this sorry state of affairs , the world may be getting a glimpse of a very ugly future .
whereas Syria denies political freedom to its citizens , it tolerates significantly more social freedom than many other Arab countries , particularly Saudi Arabia , which is leading the charge to oust Assad . governed by minority Alawites ( a Shia sect ) , Syria harbors a kaleidoscope of distinct groups : Arabs , Armenians , Christians , Kurds , Druze , Ismailis , and Bedouin . &amp; nbsp ;
it is this tolerance of cultural and religious diversity that could be endangered if the Sunni-inspired revolt sweeps the country . and that is why Syria simultaneously generates revulsion at the regime ’ s atrocities and fear of what might follow if the regime is defeated .
in an ancient land such as Syria , there can be no examination of the problems of the present without reflecting upon the past . history , after all , is always the mother of the present , and geography the progenitor .
in his history of the Arab world in the aftermath of World War I , A Peace to End all Peace , David Fromkin suggests that the Middle East today reflects the failure of the European powers to consolidate the political systems that they imposed . Britain and its allies “ destroyed the old order , ” smashing Turkish rule of the Arabic-speaking Middle East .
but , in the wake of the American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the intervention in Libya , is not the same experiment being repeated almost a century later ? that is the question that realistic policymakers should be asking themselves as they ponder what to do in Syria .
in August 1919 , British Foreign Minister Arthur Balfour summarized the essence of the problem that is now confronting policymakers . “ The unhappy truth , ” he wrote , “ is that France , England , and America have got themselves … so inextricably confused that no … satisfactory answer is now possible . ”
does that not sound familiar ? and is not an updated version of Syrian ( and then Iraqi ) King Faisal ’ s exhortation to Arabs – “ Choose to be either slaves or masters of your own destiny ” – echoed in the political pronouncements of new leaders in Egypt and elsewhere .
the French , as Fromkin reminds us , “ shrank Syria , so that they could control it , ” rewarding their “ Christian allies by swelling the borders of Mount Lebanon with the Bekaa valley , the Mediterranean ports of Tyre , Sidon , Beirut and Tripoli , and … land … north of Palestine . thousands of Muslims &#91; suddenly &#93; belonged to a state dominated by Christians . ”
so , as the Oxford historian Margaret Macmillan argues in her book The Peacemakers , Syria ’ s leaders , remembering these events when Westerners probably did not , “ took the opportunity ” presented by the Black September crisis of 1970 to send troops to their country ’ s lost lands .
the combination of ethnic and sectarian fears and rivalries , historical memories , and willful blindness among outside powers seems almost predestined to destabilize the entire Middle East again . Turkey is resurgent yet troubled ;
indeed , the great arc stretching from Cairo to the Hindu Kush threatens to become the locus of global disorder . little wonder that Iranian envoy Saeed Jalili , after meeting Assad in Damascus recently , announced that “ Iran will absolutely not allow the axis of resistance , of which it considers Syria to be a main pillar , to be broken in any way . ”
for Turkey , Syria ’ s plight is a strategic nightmare , because any breakup of Syria implies the possible rise of a greater Kurdistan , which would raise claims to a great swath of Turkish territory .
is there a solution to this grim impasse ? certainly , one will not be found in more United Nations resolutions , which is why US President Barack Obama is now believed to favor a “ managed transition ” in Syria that would not fatally erode the existing instruments of the Syrian state .
Western countries ’ national interests will no longer determine the moral and political impulses of today ’ s global community . indeed , whatever the outcome , Syria ’ s agony has underscored a further irreversible weakening of the West ’ s dominant global role .
three New Lessons of the Euro Crisis
Washington , DC – While some observers argue that the key lesson of the eurozone ’ s baptism by fire is that greater fiscal and banking integration are needed to sustain the currency union , many economists pointed this out even before the euro ’ s introduction in 1999 . the real lessons of the euro crisis lie elsewhere – and they are genuinely new and surprising .
first , were the regions to be united similar or dissimilar in terms of their economies ’ vulnerability to external shocks ? the more similar the regions , the more optimal the resulting currency area , because policy responses could be applied uniformly across its entire territory .
if economic structures were dissimilar , then the second criterion became critical : were arrangements in place to adjust to asymmetric shocks ? the two key arrangements that most economists emphasized were fiscal transfers , which could cushion shocks in badly affected regions , and labor mobility , which would allow workers from such regions to move to less affected ones .
the irony here is that the impetus toward currency union was partly a result of the recognition of asymmetries . thus , in the aftermath of the sterling and lira devaluations of the early 1990 ’ s , with their resulting adverse trade shocks to France and Germany , the lesson that was drawn was that a single currency was needed to prevent such disparate shocks from recurring .
but this overlooked a crucial feature of monetary unions : free capital mobility and elimination of currency risk – indispensable attributes of a currency area – could be ( and were ) the source of asymmetric shocks . currency unions , in other words , must worry about endogenous as much as exogenous shocks .
free capital mobility allowed surpluses from large savers such as Germany to flow to capital importers such as Spain , while the perceived elimination of currency risk served to aggravate such flows . to investors , Spanish housing assets seemed a great investment , because the forces of economic convergence unleashed by the euro would surely push up their prices – and because there was no peseta that could lose value .
these capital flows created a boom – and a loss of long-term competitiveness – in some regions , which was followed by an all-too-predictable bust . to the extent that monetary and fiscal arrangements fail to reduce or eliminate moral hazard , the risk that capital flows create these endogenous asymmetric shocks will remain commensurately high .
in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 , South Korea needed dollars , because its firms had borrowed in dollars that domestic savers could not fully supply . thus , it entered into a swap arrangement with the Federal Reserve to guarantee that South Korea ’ s demand for foreign currency would be met .
of course , the euro crisis was not just a liquidity crisis . several countries in the periphery ( Greece , Spain , and Portugal ) were responsible for the circumstances that led to and precipitated the crisis , and there may be fundamental solvency issues that need to be addressed even if the liquidity shortfall is addressed .
there was always a downside – previously ignored but now highly salient in our mercantilist era – to this supposed privilege . if investors flock to “ safe ” US financial assets , these capital flows must keep the dollar significantly stronger that it would be otherwise , which is an unambiguous cost , especially at a time of idle resources and unutilized capacity .
but , yoked to weak economies such as Greece , Spain , and Portugal , the euro has also been much weaker than the Deutschemark would have been . in effect , Germany has had the double exorbitant privilege of lower borrowing costs and a weaker currency – a feat that a non-monetary-union currency like the US dollar cannot accomplish .
but its development so far has forever changed and improved our understanding of currency unions . and that will be true regardless of whether the eurozone achieves the closer fiscal and banking arrangements that remain necessary to sustain it .
what the West Can Do
Tbilisi – Given the tremendous damage that Russia has inflicted on Georgia , it is easy to conclude that the Kremlin has achieved its objectives . but , so far , Russia has failed in its real goal – getting rid of Mikheil Saakashvili , Georgia ’ s pro-democracy , pro-American president .
it shattered the Georgian military , grievously damaged Georgia ’ s economy , and stirred up discord within the Western alliance . for three years , it has tried every conceivable tactic to bring Saakashvili down – fomenting a domestic uprising , imposing an economic blockade , beefing up its forces in the enclaves , and finally a war .
Russian tanks are less than 25 miles away , and the wheat fields along the main road to Gori were ablaze , set on fire by Russian troops , as I drove through Russian checkpoints to get to that deserted , occupied city . ( most memorable sight : drunken Russian soldiers in stolen Georgian uniforms – “ because they are better than ours . ” )
but , as the West debates how to “ punish Russia , ” it is vital to remember that the main front is still in Georgia . talk about taking away the 2014 Winter Olympics or ejecting Russia from the G-8 may ( or may not ) have some effect on the Kremlin , but the most important thing the West can do now is strengthen the government in Tbilisi .
the intense personal hatred between these men overlays two centuries of tortured history between Russia and Georgia . many people report that Putin simply “ loses it ” when discussing the upstart Saakashvili , who led his country from near bankruptcy into a golden age of economic growth and the world ’ s highest rate of foreign direct investment relative to GDP .
( his predecessor , Eduard Shevardnadze , was a near-miss target for several assassination attempts that are widely believed to have been Russian-directed . ) The Kremlin ’ s best hope now is that Georgia ’ s economy will crumble , its currency will collapse , and an unhappy populace , encouraged by some opposition leader ( perhaps bankrolled by Russia ) , will force Saakashvili from power .
Prime Minister Vladimir Gurgenidze estimates that rebuilding railroads , bridges , ports and other infrastructure will cost at least $ 1 billion ; this does not include humanitarian relief , refugee resettlement costs , or rebuilding Georgia ’ s military . Gurgenidze also foresees negative economic growth , a huge budget deficit , and a collapse of tourism , which was just taking off in this beautiful country .
Congress will be in session only briefly before the election , and a supplemental appropriation will pass only if President Bush pursues it vigorously as a bipartisan measure . even if delayed until next year , its immediate proposal by Bush and endorsement by both presidential candidates would help morale in Georgia .
Saakashvili , an immensely talented 41-year-old , saved his country from utter collapse in 2003 . but he must think strategically about the future .
on occasion , he has berated the Europeans for insufficient support – not a good tactic for someone trying to join the EU – and has used rhetoric about Russia that , while understandable , only increases the danger to himself . Saakashvili cannot pick up his tiny country and move it to Mexico .
this is especially true for Ukraine and Azerbaijan , which are likely to be Moscow ’ s next targets for intimidation . the rules of the post-Cold War world are changing – but not to the ultimate benefit of Russia , which has underestimated the unifying effect its actions will have on the West .
what to Expect From the 44th President
new YORK – Campaigns , be they political or military , are waged to be won , and the current American presidential campaign is no exception . the Democratic and Republican candidates are doing all they can to distinguish themselves from an unpopular incumbent president and from one another in the remaining weeks before Americans vote .
John McCain emphasizes how much things have turned around since early 2007 , when US troop numbers were increased and US strategy revised . observers could be forgiven for thinking that they are speaking about two entirely different conflicts .
no matter who wins this November , it is clear that Iraq will not dominate US foreign policy in the years ahead to anything near the degree that it has in recent years . we are entering the post-Iraq era of American foreign policy .
by contrast , the US commitment to Afghanistan will increase , and troop levels will climb . behind this prediction is a widely shared assessment that the trends in Afghanistan ( unlike in Iraq ) are negative , and that the US must strengthen its military presence there and revise its strategy if the Taliban are not to gain the upper hand .
here , Barack Obama appears more willing to have the US launch unilateral military raids against terrorists should the opportunity arise . but whoever is elected will confront difficult choices if a nuclear-armed Pakistan remains unable or unwilling to act as an American partner and meet its responsibilities in the effort against terrorism .
under the next president , the US will no longer be a drag on international efforts to create a global regime that sets a ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions . one result of this likely evolution in US policy is that pressure will shift to other countries , particularly China and India , to accept some limits on their own economic behavior .
one of his first decisions will be to implement a ban on all forms of torture . also to be expected early on is a decision to close the facility at Guantánamo Bay , where terrorism suspects have been held for years without trial .
both candidates have stressed that an Iran with nuclear weapons would be unacceptable . the victor will almost surely endorse a new diplomatic initiative aimed at ending Iran ’ s independent ability to enrich uranium .
Obama seems to regard meeting with foreign leaders as a normal component of foreign policy , to be employed as one of many tools . McCain appears to embrace the view that such meetings are something of a reward , to be offered when preconditions are met ( Iran comes to mind ) and withdrawn when certain lines are crossed , as Russia was judged to have done this August in Georgia .
Congress plays a large role in trade policy , and the near certainty that the Democratic Party ’ s majority in Congress will grow after the election means that protectionism will grow as well . difficult economic times will make it hard to generate support for trade pacts , despite the current importance of export-oriented firms for the American economy .
but there are also more similarities than might be evident from the debates and the campaign . aspects of the next president ’ s foreign policy are there to see if observers read between the lines and take as much note of what is not said as what is .
what Went Wrong with America
the latest edition of the Pew Global Attitudes Survey shows that favorable opinions of the United States have fallen again in 12 out of 15 countries polled , a sad reflection of a country ’ s loss of image . how can America recover international legitimacy ?
the US had a unique opportunity at the end of the Cold War to use its benevolent and enlightened superiority to establish a better international order . but , for a combination of political and personal reasons , America lost time under the two presidencies of Bill Clinton .
indeed , during this necessarily short and fragile “ unipolar moment , ” Clinton probably had an intuition of what America ’ s new responsibilities should be , but he did not deliver . the defeat of the Democrats in the mid-term elections in 1994 , followed by the Monica Lewinsky affair , hampered the effectiveness of one of America ’ s most energetic and gifted Presidents .
by contrast , George W. Bush did not lose time . he did worse : he simply took a wrong turn – and he took it before 9 / 11 , a traumatic event that reinforced , but did not create , America ’ s Manichean view of itself and its role in the world .
three recent examples illustrate what went wrong with America , its loss of unique status , and its growing image as a partisan and unethical , if not destabilizing , force in the world .
in strictly legal terms , there is nothing wrong , since India never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . but in psychological and political terms , the deal signed could only be perceived as legitimizing for Iran ’ s nuclear ambitions , not to mention North Korea ’ s .
regimes that systematically violate human rights have been quick to seize on every episode of US wrongdoing . with its own human rights record in question , the US , which had been the democratic teacher of the post-war world , is in a much weaker position to give lessons and set standards .
nor does the appearance of hypocrisy end there . at a time when “ democracy ” and “ democratization ” have become the watchwords of US foreign policy , normalization of diplomatic relations with Gaddafi ’ s Libya , not to mention leniency towards Egypt and Saudi Arabia hardly boosts America ’ s credibility .
in global terms , the contrast between what America says and what it does has become glaring . in February 2005 , in a major speech in Paris during her first foreign trip as Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice stated America ’ s ambition in the world .
on the contrary , the failures of US policy have contributed to reduce the legitimacy of America ’ s power further . despite the recent death of Zarqawi in Iraq , the situation there , and in Afghanistan , does not justify the continued Bush administration ’ s optimism .
as America ’ s legitimacy diminishes , new actors are appearing on the world stage – or returning for an encore . Russia and China today are united not only by their energy deals , but also by both countries ’ conviction that their time has come , and that the outside world needs them more than they need the outside world , particularly the US .
of course , given America ’ s objective military superiority , I would call it “ asymmetrical multi-polarity . ” But the US is no longer the country that others seek to emulate , or that they look to for global leadership .
the next US president should be able to capitalize on Americans ’ fundamental optimism , pragmatism , and activism . but he or she will face an uphill struggle to prove to the world that America can be a force for good , a democratic beacon that cares for the planet and that lives up to the standards that it sets for others .
when Democracies Collide
Berlin – The multipolar nature of today ’ s international system will again be on display at the upcoming G-20 summit in Los Cabos , Mexico . global problems are no longer solved , crises managed , or global rules defined , let alone implemented , the old-fashioned way , by a few , mostly Western , powers .
politically , however , most of them have crossed the threshold that has long limited their access to the kitchen of international decision-making . the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council ( the “ P-5 ” ) still defend their right to veto resolutions , and their military power is unmatched .
it is equally unlikely for the foreseeable future that any one club of countries , such as the G-7 or G-8 , will again assume a quasi-hegemonic position . even the G-20 in its current composition may not really represent the forces that can and will shape the twenty-first century .
for example , they differ about climate policies , seeing a threat to development . similarly , while new middle and great powers do not always agree , they are generally more skeptical of both international sanctions and military interventions .
moreover , some of the most important of these states differ substantially with the US , and often also with the EU , about the right approach toward regional conflicts , especially in the Middle East . thus , in 2010 , the US found itself in a serious diplomatic dispute with Turkey and Brazil about how to resolve the conflict with Iran over its nuclear program .
differences are also apparent where new democratic middle or great powers have formed new groups or clubs , such as the BRICS , together with non-democratic powers . India , Brazil , and South Africa are using such formats in a pragmatic way to pursue their interests , or simply to demonstrate their increased international weight .
along with many other states in the global South , however , Russia and China tend to defend the principle of non-interference , and they are generally reluctant to support any US or European attempts to project democracy or defend human rights in other countries .
not a few policymakers in the US and in Europe have reacted with astonishment , or even annoyance , to these emerging democratic powers ’ attempts to pursue their own agendas on the world stage . such reactions partly reflect old thinking rooted in the Cold War , when democratic countries might differ over details , but would agree about the main questions of international politics .
by contrast , a central feature of today ’ s globalized , multipolar world is that shared democratic values do not guarantee agreement about substantial questions of international politics . the more democracies there are , the more conflicts of interests and differences are likely to emerge between democratic countries .
there is little reason to react with anger when states like Turkey , Brazil , and South Africa set priorities different from those of Europe or the US , or have different views about how to deal with the Arab-Israeli conflict , Iran , development aid , democracy promotion , or environmental protection . the US example shows clearly that democratic great powers often pursue their interests with little regard for a global common good that others have defined .
in other words , the international order is becoming more pluralistic . the task for established Western democracies is to accept and cope with such “ democratic differences ” on the international level , and to seek multilateral coalitions to manage or solve problems .
Europeans are well practiced in dealing with differences and shaping consensus among principally like-minded states . that said , Europe needs to learn to be clearer and more transparent about the interests underlying its own policies , rather than suggesting that its positions on a specific subject represent the only rational implementation of democratic values and norms .
when France Says No
the collapse in 1940 revealed the fragility of France ’ s democracy and its loss of confidence in the country ’ s capacity to face outside threats . in rejecting the European constitution , France expressed its fear of , among other things , globalization .
in both cases , a major historical mistake was made . France had to a large extent initiated both treaties , had managed to get them accepted by its European partners , but in the end vetoed its own undertakings .
the proposed defense treaty was also to be buttressed by plans for a European political community whose main features were to be defined by a constitutional commission made up of members of national parliaments . in effect , this commission would have been the precursor to the 2003-2004 Convention for the Future of Europe , which , presided over by former French President Valéry Giscard d ’ Estaing drafted the constitutional treaty .
political parties and others who mobilized opposition to the EDC feared a remilitarized Germany and a threat to France ’ s sovereignty . today , those in France who opposed the EU constitution succeeded in stigmatizing “ Europe ” as the threat .
back in the 1950 ’ s , the founding nations ’ foreign ministers promptly turned to their Belgian colleague , Paul-Henri Spaak , for fresh proposals . after intensive discussion among the six , and especially between France and Germany , the Treaty of Rome was drawn up and signed within two years of the EDC debacle .
by contrast , two years after the French and Dutch No votes , there is no sign of a Plan B , despite the claims of the French politicians who helped mobilize the No vote . Europe ’ s Franco-German locomotive has broken down and ratification has stopped , even though member states that had yet to ratify the treaty could have completed the process of ratification .
France ’ s loss of influence in Europe is no longer at stake today , because the notion of influence presupposes that the overriding preoccupation of EU member states is to advance their own national interests . if Europe were only about gaining the upper hand , it would generate perpetual conflict .
a journalist recently expressed the view that France ’ s special role in Europe was due to its “ centrality , ” meaning that the French are , in equal measure , both open to the world and attached to their nation . they also participate successfully in a market economy while seeking to preserve an egalitarian social model .
the No vote sullied this image of a balanced France . indeed , the French themselves are among the first to lament their bleak situation , inventing a new concept – “ la déclinologie ” – to describe this loss of self – confidence .
to be sure , the rise of populism in Europe was not caused by the French ; nationalism is deeply rooted in Europe ’ s history and has many causes . but France ’ s referendum result fueled other European governments ’ fears that any new proposal they might put forward to re-launch the EU constitution would fail in the face of domestic and Europe-wide opposition .
Europeans need to recognize that strength lies in unity , and that Europe ’ s integration cannot be guaranteed without a common constitutional framework that promotes a common identity . until we think in terms of European sovereignty , rather than fret over risks to national sovereignty , the present crisis cannot be overcome .
when India Votes
Kerala , INDIA – Beginning this month , the largest exercise of the democratic franchise in history will take place , as India n voters head to the polls to elect a new national parliament . they have done this 14 times since India gained its independence .
this time , the electorate includes 714 million voters , an increase of 43 million over the previous general election in 2004 . votes will be cast in 828,804 polling stations scattered throughout the country for over 5000 candidates from seven national political parties and several state and other parties .
the numbers involved are so huge that the elections will be staggered over five phases , ending only on May 13 , with electoral and security personnel being moved from state to state as polling is concluded in each place . despite the phased voting , the counting takes place nationwide immediately after the last phase , and the results of the elections everywhere will be announced on May 16 .
nor is any Indian election complete without the media publishing at least one picture of a female voter whose enthusiasm for the suffrage is undimmed by the fact that she is old , blind , crippled , toothless , purdah-clad , or any combination of the above .
because so many voters are illiterate , India invented the party symbol , so that voters who cannot read the name of their candidate can vote for him or her anyway by recognizing the symbol under which they campaigned . symbols range from the open palm of the ruling Indian National Congress to the lotus of the Bharatiya Janata Party and variants of the hammer and sickle for India ’ s profusion of Communist parties .
independent candidates can choose from an assortment of alternatives , ranging from a cricket bat to images of various large animals . ( small ones were removed from the list when one candidate , running against another whose symbol was a parrot , wrung the neck of a live parrot at a public meeting to signify what he would do to his rival . )
in this election , as in previous ones , votes will be cast on electronic voting machines invented in India , which combine the virtues of simplicity , reliability , and ruggedness . the electoral rolls carry photographs of every individual voter , as does each voter ’ s identity card .
there was a time when , in certain parts of India , workers could stuff ballot boxes for a candidate and political parties could “ capture ” polling booths . electronic voting machines and strict security arrangements have largely eliminated that possibility .
elections are an enduring spectacle of free India , and give foreign journalists the opportunity to remind the world that India is the world ’ s largest democracy . indeed , Indians now take for granted that elections will take place , that they will be free and fair , and that they will result in actual transfers of power .
there are few developing countries in the world where this is true , and fewer still where poverty and illiteracy are both rife . that may be the real miracle of what will occur in India over the next few weeks .
the Myth of Khaki Democracy
new YORK – Egypt and Thailand have little in common , except for one thing . in both countries , at different times , educated people who pride themselves on being democrats have ended up applauding military coups against elected governments .
this perversity is not without reason . the elected leaders in both countries , Thaksin Shinawatra in Thailand and Mohamed Morsi in Egypt , were good examples of illiberal democrats : they tended to view their electoral success as a mandate to manipulate constitutional norms and behave like autocrats .
and if the leaders of Algeria ’ s Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) had been allowed to take power in 1991 , after their early success in a democratic election , they would almost certainly have been illiberal rulers . ( instead , they were crushed by a military coup , before a second round of elections could take place , triggering a brutal eight-year civil war in which an estimated 200,000 people died . )
only the frail and ailing 85-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej still functions as a symbol of national cohesion . without him , fighting between the rural poor and the urban elites could quickly erupt again .
in two separate incidents in July , security forces opened fire on supporters of the Brotherhood as they peacefully protested against Morsi ’ s ouster and arrest , killing almost 200 people . Secret-police units that were active under former President Hosni Mubarak ( and known for their frequent use of torture ) are being reconstituted for the first time since the 2011 revolution .
none of this is either democratic or liberal . and yet many Egyptians , including some human-rights activists , have endorsed it .
